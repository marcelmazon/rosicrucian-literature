    - [Question No. 65: Why, with a few exceptions, are we reincarnated without having the slightest knowledge of any previous existence, and thus suffer blindly in this life for transgressions of which we are entirely ignorant, committed in some former life?

    - [Question No. 72: How can you believe in the theory of reincarnation--that we come back here in the body of an animal? Is it not much more beautiful to believe in the Christian doctrine that we go to heaven with God and the Angels?](#question-72)

    - [Question No. 165: Are not enormous and destructive reptiles created by the evil thoughts of men, so far as the form is concerned? And, therefore, is it not an act of love to kill them and thus liberate the divine spark within so that it may occupy a higher form?](#question-165)

### <h3 id="a-word-of-explanation">Introduction</h3>

Les questions que contient ce livre ont été posées à l'auteur à l'issue de conférences faites dans différentes villes des Etats-Unis. Ainsi qu'on pourra le voir, les auteurs de ces questions possédaient déjà une certaine connaissance du sujet.

A l'intention des lecteurs qui ne seraient pas du tout au courant des enseignements de la "Cosmogonie des Rose-Croix", il peut être utile de fournir ici des précisions sur quelques-uns des termes le plus souvent employés, ce qui permettra de mieux comprendre les réponses données dans cet ouvrage. Nous ajouterons que chacune de ces questions a été traitée indépendamment des autres et qu'elle est complète en elle-même. On trouvera donc quelques redites, mais comme il s'agit chaque fois d'un aspect nouveau du problème, cette méthode a été jugée préférable à celle des renvois, le lecteur n'ayant pas toujours le loisir de se reporter à d'autres textes.

La philosophie des Rose-Croix enseigne que l'homme est un être composite, possédant:

(1) UN CORPS DENSE, intrument visible dans lequel il exerce son activité physiqye en ce monde. C'est ce coprs que l'on prend ordinairement pour l'homme complet.

(2) UN CORPS VITAL, fait d'éther, qui interpénètre toutes choses, à cette différence près que l'homme polarise l'éther universel dans des proportions plus grandes que ne le font les autres formes. Ce corps éthérique est l'instrument dont se sert l'homme pour assimiler l'énergie vital du soleil.

(3) UN CORPS DU DÉSIR, ou nature émotionnelle, qui interpénètre à la fois le corps vital et le corps dense. Ce véhicule subtil apparaît aux yeux du clairvoyant comme un nuage ovoïde s'étendant à quarante centimètres environ de la périphérie du corps physique, lequel se trouve placé en son centre comme le jaune au centre de l'oeuf.

(4) UN INTELLECT OU MENTAL, miroir réfléchissant le monde extérieur, ce qui permet à l'Ego de transmettre ses ordres sous formes de pensées et de paroles et de commander ainsi l'action.

L'EGO est l'esprit triple qui utilise ces véhicules dans le but d'acquérir de l'expérience à l'école de la vie. 

<h2 id="section-1">Partie 1 - Questions Traitant de la Vie sur Terre</h2>

### <h3 id="question-1">Question 1</h3>

Si nous étions de pur esprit et partie d'un Dieu Omniscient, pourquoi a-t-il été nécessaire pour nous de faire ce long pèlerinage de péché et de souffrance à travers la matière?

RÉPONSE - Au commencement de la manifestation, Dieu a différencié en Lui-même une multitude d'intelligences spirituelles potentielles, comme les étincelles sont émises par un feu. Ces intelligences spirituelles étaient donc des flammes ou des feux potentiels, mais elles n'étaient pas encore des feux car, bien que douées de l'omniconscience de Dieu, elles manquait de la soi- conscience; bien qu'étant potentiellement omnipotentes comme Dieu, elles manquaient du pouvoir dynamique utilisable à n'importe quel moment selon leur volonté; et pour que ces qualités puissent être développées, il était impératif qu'elles passent à travers la matière. C'est pourquoi, durant l'involution, chaque Etincelle Divine fut confinée dans divers véhicules de densité suffisante pour isoler sa conscience du monde extérieur. Alors l'esprit intérieur, n'étant plus capable de se mettre en contact avec l'extérieur, se tourne vers le dedans et se trouve lui-même. Avec l'éveil de la soi-conscience vient la lutte de l'esprit pour se libérer de sa prison, et durant l'évolution, les différents véhicules que l'esprit possède seront spiritualisés en âme, de telle sorte qu'à la fin de la manifestation, l'esprit aura non seulement acquis la soi-conscience mais aussi le pouvoir de l'âme.

La plupart des gens ont tendance à croire que tout ce qui existe est le résultat de quelque chose d'autre, ne laissant pas de place pour une construction nouvelle, originale. Ceux qui étudient la vie parlent en général seulement d'involution et d'évolution; ceux qui étudient la forme, à savoir les savants modernes, ne s'intéressent qu'à l'évolution, mais les plus avancés d'entre eux sont en train de découvrir un autre facteur qu'ils ont appelé l'épigénèse. En 1757 déjà, Caspard-Frédéric Wolff publia sa "Theorea Generationis", dans laquelle il démontrait que dans le développement de l'ovule il y a une série de constructions nouvelles qui ne sont pas du tout prévues par ce qui s'est produit auparavant; et Haeckel, adoptant ces conclusions, dit que, de nos jours, il n'est plus justifié d'appeler l'épigénèse une théorie, car elle est un fait que nous pouvons démontrer, à l'aide d'un microscope, dans le cas des formes inférieures où les changements sont rapides. Depuis que l'intellect a été donné à l'homme, c'est l'épigénèse, impulsion créatrice originelle, qui a été la cause de tout notre développement. Certes, nous construisons sur ce qui a déjà été créé, mais il y a aussi quelque chose de nouveau dû à l'activité de l'esprit, et c'est ainsi que nous devenons des créateurs, car si nous ne faisions qu'imiter ce qui a déjà été tracé pour nous par Dieu ou par les Anges, nous n'aurions jamais la possibilité de devenir des intelligences créatrices; nous serions simplement des imitateurs. Et bien que nous fassions des erreurs, on peut dire que souvent nous apprenons plus par nos erreurs que par nos succès. Le péché et la souffrance dont parle l'auteur de la question sont simplement le résultat des erreurs que nous faisons, et l'impression qu'elles font sur notre conscience nous incite à être actifs dans d'autres directions qui se révèlent être bonnes, c'est-à-dire en harmonie avec la nature. Ce monde est donc une école préparatoire et non une vallée de larmes dans laquelle nous aurait placé un Dieu capricieux. (voir question 9).

### <h3 id="question-2">Question 2</h3>

Si "Dieu a fait l'homme un peu inférieur aux Anges", comment est- il possible que l'homme doive finalement leur être supérieur dans le Monde Spirituel?

RÉPONSE - Cette question révèle une méprise de la part de son auteur. Cela n'a jamais été affirmé de cette manière dans les enseignements Rosicruciens, mais nous avons dit quelque chose qui a pu être mal interprété. Le fait est que l'évolution progresse en spirale et qu'il n'y a jamais répétition de la même condition. Les Anges sont un courant d'évolution antérieur, et il étaient humains au cours d'une précédente incarnation de la Terre, appelée la Période de la Lune par les Rosicruciens. Les Archanges étaient l'humanité de la Période du Soleil, et les Seigneurs de l'Intellect, que Paul appelle les "Puissances des Ténèbres" (Colossiens 1/13), étaient l'humanité de la sombre Période de Saturne. Et nous sommes l'humanité de la quatrième période du plan de manifestation, la Période de la Terre. Comme tous les êtres dans l'univers progressent, l'humanité des précédentes périodes a aussi évolué de sorte qu'elles sont maintenant à un degré supérieur à celui qui était le leur lorsqu'elles étaient au stade humain - et leur développement est suprahumain. Il est donc parfaitement vrai que Dieu a fait l'homme un peu inférieur aux Anges. Mais comme toute chose est dans un état de progression en spirale, il est vrai aussi que notre humanité actuelle est une humanité supérieure à celle des Anges et plus évoluée; et il est vrai aussi que les Anges furent une humanité supérieure à celle des Archanges lorsque ceux-ci étaient humains. Dans notre prochaine étape nous atteindrons quelque chose de semblable au niveau des Anges actuellement, mais nous serons supérieurs à ce qu'ils sont maintenant.

### <h3 id="question-3">Question 3</h3>

Pourquoi était-il nécessaire pour nous de venir dans cette existence physique? N'aurions-nous pas pu apprendre les même leçons sans être emprisonnés et limités par les conditions denses du monde matériel?

RÉPONSE - A l'origine, le Nouveau Testament a été écrit en Grec, et le mot Logos signifie à la fois le verbe et la pensée qui précède le verbe, de sorte que lorsque Jean nous dit dans le premier chapitre de son Evangile que "Au commencement était le verbe, et le verbe était avec Dieu, et le verbe était Dieu", nous pouvons aussi traduire ce verset comme suit: "Au commencement était la pensée, et le verbe était avec Dieu, et Dieu était le verbe". Tout existe en vertu de ce fait (le verbe). En lui est la "vie".

Tout ce qui existe dans l'univers a d'abord été une pensée, cette pensée s'est ensuite manifestée par un mot, un son qui a construit toutes les formes et lui-même s'est manifesté en tant que vie à l'intérieur de ces formes. Voilà le processus de la création, et l'homme, qui a été fait à l'image de Dieu, crée de la même façon dans une certaine mesure. Il a la faculté de penser; il peut exprimer ses pensées par la voix, et lorsqu'il n'est pas capable de concrétiser ses idées seul, il peut s'assurer l'aide d'autrui pour les réaliser. Mais le jour viendra où il créera directement par le verbe de sa bouche, et il est en train d'apprendre maintenant à créer par d'autres moyens, afin qu'au moment où il sera capable d'utiliser son verbe pour créer directement, il sache comment le faire. Cette instruction est absolument nécessaire. Actuellement, il ferait de nombreuses erreurs. En outre, il n'est pas encore bon et il amènerait à l'existence des créations démoniaques.

A l'aube de ses premières tentatives, l'homme a utilisé les solides; la force musculaire était le seul moyen d'accomplir le travail, et il a ébauché avec des os et des pierres ramassés sur le sol, ses premiers outils qu'il maniait à la force de son bras. Plus tard, dans un tronc d'arbre creusé, il s'est confié à l'eau; un liquide et la roue à aubes ont réalisé sa première machine. Le liquide est doué d'une force bien plus grande que les solides. Une vague peut raser les ponts d'un navire, en arracher les mâts et tordre la plus forte barre de métal comme un mince fil de fer; mais la puissance motrice de l'eau est stationnaire, et ne peut donc être utilisée que dans son voisinage immédiat. Lorsque l'homme eut appris à se servir de la force encore plus subtile que nous appelons air, il lui a été possible de construire des moulins à vent partout, pour faire son travail, et les bateaux à voiles relièrent toutes les parties du monde. Ainsi, ce nouveau pas de l'homme a été réalisé grâce à l'utilisation d'une force encore plus subtile que l'eau et plus universellement applicable que cet élément. Mais le vent est capricieux et l'on ne peut pas toujours s'y fier, et les progrès réalisés grâce à lui sont peu de chose en comparaison de ceux qui ont résulté de la découverte et de l'utilisation d'un gaz encore plus subtil, la vapeur, qui peut être produite partout et en tout temps; depuis cette découverte, les progrès dans le monde ont été énormes. Toutefois, la vapeur a l'inconvénient de nécessiter un mécanisme de transmission compliqué. Ce désavantage s'est trouvé pratiquement éliminé par l'emploi d'une force plus subtile encore et plus facilement transmissible, à la fois invisible et intangible: l'électricité.

Ainsi, nous voyons que le progrès de l'homme dans le passé a dépendu de l'utilisation de forces de plus en plus subtiles, chacune d'elles d'un transport plus aisé que la précédente, et nous comprenons ainsi que le progrès futur de l'homme dépend de la découverte de forces encore plus fines et d'un transport encore plus facile. Nous savons que les ondes de la télégraphie sans fil se transmettent sans conducteur, mais même ce système n'est pas idéal, car il dépend de l'énergie générée dans une centrale qui est stationnaire et qui est munie d'un outillage fixe et trop coûteux pour être à la portée de la majorité. La force idéale serait une énergie que l'homme pourrait générer de l'intérieur de lui-même, à n'importe quel moment et sans aucun mécanisme.

Il y a quelques dizaines d'années, Jules Verne nous a enthousiasmé avec "Vingt mille lieues sous les mers" et le "Tour du Monde en quatre-vingt jours". Mais aujourd'hui ces choses sont dépassées par les réalisations qui ont suivi, et le jour viendra où nous disposerons de la force motrice idéale à laquelle nous venons de faire allusion. Dans son livre intitulé "La race future", Bulwer Lytton décrit une force appelée "Vril" que possèdent certains êtres imaginaires, et qui leur sert de moyen de propulsion sur terre, dans les airs et ailleurs. Or, cette force est latente en chacun de nous, et nous en parlons quelquefois sous le nom d'émotion. Nous en sentons la puissance, parfois, en tant que colère lorsqu'elle se déchaîne, et nous disons alors "qu'une personne a perdu la maîtrise d'elle-même". Aucune somme de travail ne peut fatiguer et détériorer le corps physique autant que l'énorme énergie du corps du désir lorsqu'il lui est laissé libre cours dans un accès de colère. Actuellement, cette énorme force est généralement en sommeil, et il est heureux qu'il en soit ainsi jusqu'à ce que nous ayons appris à l'utiliser par le moyen de la pensée qui est une force encore plus subtile. Ce monde est une école qui nous enseigne à penser et à ressentir correctement afin de nous qualifier pour utiliser ces deux forces subtiles que sont le pouvoir de la pensée et le pouvoir de l'émotion.

L'exemple suivant fera comprendre comment ce monde terrestre sert ce but. Un inventeur a une idée. Cette idée n'est pas encore une pensée, c'est comme un flash qui n'a pas encore pris forme, mais peu à peu il se la représente dans la substance-intellect. Il forme dans sa pensée une machine, et devant sa vision mentale cette machine apparaît avec ses rouages qui tournent de telle et telle façon, pour accomplir le travail voulu. Ensuite il commence à dessiner les plans de la machine et, dès ce degré de concrétisation, des modifications vont certainement être nécessaires. Ainsi nous voyons que les conditions physiques montrent à l'inventeur où sa pensée n'était pas correcte. Lorsqu'il construit la machine avec les matériaux appropriés au travail envisagé, d'autres modifications sont généralement nécessaires. Peut-être sera-t-il obligé de mettre au rebut la première machine, de revoir entièrement sa conception et de construire une nouvelle machine. Donc, ce sont bien les conditions physiques, concrètes, qui ont permis à l'inventeur de détecter le point faible de son raisonnement; elles l'obligent à apporter les modifications nécessaires à sa pensée originale afin de réaliser une machine qui fasse le travail prévu. S'il n'y avait eu que le Monde de la Pensée, il n'aurait pas su qu'il avait commis une erreur, mais les conditions physiques, concrètes, lui montrent où sa pensée était fausse.

Le Monde Physique enseigne à l'inventeur à penser correctement, et ses machines, réussies, sont la manifestation de sa pensée juste.

Le même principe est valable dans les entreprises commerciales, sociales ou philanthropiques. Si nos idées concernant les divers domaines de la vie sont erronées, elles sont corrigées lorsqu'elles sont mises en pratique, et c'est pourquoi ce monde matériel est d'une nécessité absolue pour nous apprendre à exercer le pouvoir de la pensée et du désir, alors qu'actuellement ces deux forces sont contenues dans une grande mesure par nos conditions matérielles. Mais étant donné qu'avec le temps nous apprenons à penser de plus en plus correctement, nous obtiendrons finalement un pouvoir de la pensée qui nous permettra d'avoir la pensée juste immédiatement, dans chaque cas, sans expérimentation, et alors nous serons aussi capables d'exprimer notre pensée par le Verbe, créateur d'objets tangibles. Dans un passé très, très reculé, alors que l'homme était encore un être spirituel et que l'état de la Terre était plus plastique que de nos jours, il apprenait directement des Dieux à utiliser le Verbe pour créer, et il travaillait alors à la formation des animaux et des plantes. La Bible nous apprend que Dieu amena les animaux devant l'homme qui les nomma (Genèse 2/20). Il ne s'agissait pas simplement d'appeler un lion "lion", mais c'était un processus de formation qui donnait à l'homme un pouvoir sur la chose qu'il nommait, et ce n'est que lorsque l'égoïsme, la cruauté et la colère déchaînée eurent rendu l'homme inapte à cette maîtrise que le pouvoir du Verbe dont parlent les Franc-Maçons a été perdu. Lorsque la sainteté aura à nouveau remplacé l'impiété, le Verbe sera retrouvé et sera le pouvoir créateur de l'homme divin dans un âge futur.

### <h3 id="question-4">Question 4</h3>

Si cette vie sur terre est tellement importante et constitue réellement la base de notre croissance de l'âme qui, elle, résulte des expériences faites ici-bas, pourquoi est-elle si courte en comparaison de la vie dans les Mondes Intérieurs, dont la durée est approximativement d'un millier d'années entre deux vies ici-bas?

RÉPONSE - Tout ce qui, en ce monde, a été fait de main d'homme est de la pensée cristallisée; les chaises sur lesquelles nous sommes assis, les maisons que nous habitons, les diverses commodités tels le téléphone, les bateaux, les locomotives, etc., furent, une fois, une pensée dans l'esprit de l'homme. Sans cette pensée, l'objet n'aurait jamais été concrétisé. De la même manière, les arbres, les fleurs, les montagnes et les mers sont les formes-pensées cristallisées des forces de la nature. Lorsque l'homme quitte son corps physique après la mort et entre au Deuxième Ciel, il s'unit aux forces de la nature; il travaille sous la direction des Hiérarchies créatrices à préparer le milieu qui lui sera nécessaire dans la prochaine étape de son développement. Sur ce plan, il construit en "substance mentale" les archétypes de la terre et des mers; il travaille sur la flore et la faune; il crée toutes les choses de son environnement en tant que formes-pensées qui, lorsqu'il renaîtra, apparaîtront telles qu'il les a changées.

Mais il est très différent d'élaborer des objets à l'aide de substance mentale et d'élaborer des objets ici-bas, faits de matière concrète. Actuellement, nous sommes des penseurs très besogneux et il nous faut un temps considérable pour façonner les formes-pensées au Deuxième Ciel; ensuite, nous devons attendre un temps considérable avant que ces formes-pensées ne se soient cristallisées sous la forme de l'environnement physique dans lequel nous devons renaître. C'est la raison pour laquelle il est nécessaire que nous restions dans les Mondes Célestes beaucoup plus longtemps que sur terre. Quand nous aurons appris à penser correctement, nous serons capables de créer des objets ici-bas dans le Monde Physique, en un temps beaucoup plus court qu'il ne nous en faut actuellement pour les fabriquer laborieusement. Il ne sera alors plus nécessaire que nous restions si longtemps dans les Mondes Célestes comme c'est actuellement le cas.

### <h3 id="question-5">Question 5</h3>

Dans combien de temps pourrons-nous nous passer de nos corps physiques et fonctionner de nouveau uniquement dans les Mondes Spirituels?

RÉPONSE - Cette question révèle un état d'esprit très répandu parmi ceux qui sont habitués au fait que l'homme possède des corps spirituels dans lesquels il peut se déplacer dans l'espace avec la rapidité de l'éclair, et que ces corps, qui peuvent se passer de vêtement, ne nécessitent aucun entretien de la part de leurs propriétaires. Ces personnes soupirent après le jour où il leur poussera en quelque sorte des ailes et où elles seront libérées de cette "vile dépouille mortelle".

Cette disposition d'esprit est extrêmement regrettable. Nous devrions être reconnaissants de posséder un si bon instrument physique, car il est le plus précieux de tous ceux que nous avons. S'il est parfaitement vrai qu'il est notre véhicule inférieur, il n'en est pas moins le plus perfectionné et, sans lui, nos autres véhicules ne nous serviraient pas à grand-chose, présentement. Car cet instrument splendidement organisé nous permet de faire face aux milliers de conditions que nous rencontrons ici-bas, alors que nos véhicules supérieurs sont pratiquement inorganisés. Notre corps vital est formé, organe pour organe, sur le modèle de notre corps dense mais, tant qu'il n'aura pas été entraîné au moyen d'exercices ésotériques, ce n'est pas un instrument approprié pour y fonctionner. Le corps du désir ne possède qu'un certain nombre de centres de perception qui, chez la majorité des humains, ne sont même pas actifs. Quant à l'intellect, ce n'est encore, chez la plupart d'entre nous, qu'un nuage informe. Aujourd'hui, nous devrions nous efforcer de spiritualiser notre instrument physique, et être conscients que nous devons entraîner nos véhicules supérieurs avant qu'ils puissent être utiles. Pour la grande masse de l'humanité, ce sera un but très très long à atteindre. C'est pourquoi il est préférable d'accomplir le devoir qui est à notre portée, ainsi nous rapprocherons le jour où nous serons capables d'utiliser nos véhicules supérieurs, car ce jour dépend de nous.

### <h3 id="question-6">Question 6</h3>

L'esprit entre-t-il dans le corps au moment de la conception ou à celui de la naissance?

RÉPONSE - Des investigations faites par des clairvoyants précisent qu'au moment de la mort, l'esprit emporte avec lui les forces d'un petit atome situé dans le ventricule gauche du coeur; c'est l'atome-germe, ainsi nommé parce qu'il forme le noyau, ou germe, autour duquel se rassemblent tous les matériaux dont se compose le corps, et chaque atome dans le corps doit être capable de vibrer à l'unisson de cet atome-germe. Ainsi, cet atome est déposé dans le liquide séminal du père peu avant la conception, et placé ensuite dans la matrice de la mère. Mais la conception ne coïncide pas du tout avec l'union sexuelle des parents. Le spermatozoïde fécondé ne pénétrant parfois dans l'ovule qu'une quinzaine de jours après cette union. C'est cette fécondation de l'ovule qui peut être appelée le moment de la conception, car c'est à l'instant où l'ovule fécondé quitte la trompe de Fallope que commence la période de gestation. Pendant les dix-huit à vingt premiers jours, tout le travail est fait par la mère. A la fin de ce temps, l'Ego qui va renaître, revêtu d'un nuage de matière-désir et de matière mentale qui a la forme d'une cloche, pénètre dans le sein maternel, et le nuage en forme de cloche se ferme à sa base et prend alors une forme ovoïde. Dorénavant, l'esprit se trouve enfermé dans la chair et ne peut plus se dégager, mais doit rester avec la mère jusqu'à ce qu'il soit libéré par la naissance. Au degré actuel de notre développement, l'esprit fait très peu de travail conscient sur son véhicule en formation, mais il est présent en permanence et collabore inconsciemment à la tâche de fournir cet instrument. Ceci n'est pas plus frappant que le fait qui veut que nous soyons capables de digérer nos aliments et de faire fonctionner nos organes respiratoires sans que nous soyons conscient de chaque processus.

### <h3 id="question-7">Question 7</h3>

Quel était le but de la division des sexes?

RÉPONSE - La division des sexes a été faite tout au début de l'évolution de l'homme, alors qu'il n'avait encore ni cerveau ni larynx. Une moitié de la force créatrice fut dirigée vers le haut, pour construire ces deux organes. Le cerveau fut construit pour l'évolution de la pensée grâce à laquelle l'homme crée dans le Monde Physique; les maisons, les villes, les machines, toute chose faite de main d'homme est de la pensée humaine cristallisée.Le larynx fut aussi construit par la force sexuelle créatrice afin que l'homme puisse exprimer ses pensées. Le rapport entre ces deux organes et la force qui s'exprime par l'organe créateur inférieur sera évident si nous nous souvenons que le garçon qui possède la force créatrice positive a sa voix qui mue à la puberté, lorsqu'il devient capable de reproduire son espèce; que celui qui abuse de sa force sexuelle sombre dans l'idiotie, tandis que le profond penseur, qui utilise la presque totalité de sa force créatrice à penser, éprouve peu ou pas d'inclination pour les pratiques amoureuses.

Avant cette division, l'homme était, comme certaines plantes de nos jours, une unité créatrice complète, capable de perpétuer son espèce sans l'aide d'autrui. Les facultés de pensée et de parole ont été acquises aux dépens de ce pouvoir créateur; mais actuellement, cette moitié de la force créatrice qui s'exprime par le cerveau et le larynx peut être utilisée pour créer des choses dans le monde physique, des maisons, des bateaux, etc.

### <h3 id="question-8">Question 8</h3>

L'âme de la femme est-elle masculine et celle de l'homme féminine?

RÉPONSE - Généralement parlant, nous pourrions répondre par l'affirmative, car le corps vital qui est finalement transformé, transmué et spiritualisé en âme est de sexe opposé. Il est formé organe pour organe exactement comme le corps physique dense, à cette exception près, et ceci explique bien des choses autrement incompréhensibles. Les facultés inhérentes au corps vital sont la croissance, la reproduction, l'assimilation et la mémoire. Ayant un corps vital positif, la femme arrive plus rapidement à maturité que l'homme. Certaines parties de son corps sont à l'image de la plante, tels les cheveux par exemple qui poussent plus longs et plus abondants, et il est évident qu'un corps vital positif produit plus de sang que le corps vital négatif de l'homme; c'est pourquoi la pression sanguine, plus forte chez la femme, subit une diminution, grâce au flux périodique dont la cessation, à la ménopause, occasionne chez elle une seconde croissance, très justement appelée "embonpoint de la cinquantaine".

Les impulsions du corps du désir font circuler le sang à travers l'organisme à une allure plus ou moins rapide selon l'intensité des émotions. La femme a un excès de sang, et malgré les menstrues qui font baisser sa pression sanguine, elle a besoin par moments, d'une autre issue capable de la soulager; c'est alors que les larmes, qui sont une saignée blanche, servent de soupape de sûreté. Bien que capables autant que les femmes d'éprouver de fortes émotions, les hommes ne sont pas portés aux larmes, parce qu'ils n'ont pas plus de sang qu'ils n'en peuvent utiliser sans cesser de se trouver à l'aise.

Etant polarisée positivement dans la Région Ethérique du Monde Physique, la sphère de la femme a été le foyer familial et l'église où elle est entourée d'amour et de paix, alors que l'homme livre le combat de l'efficacité pour la survivance du plus apte, dans le Monde Physique dense où il est polarisé positivement.

### <h3 id="question-9">Question 9</h3>

Conservons-nous le même tempérament à travers toutes nos vies?

RÉPONSE - L'Ego peut être comparé à une pierre précieuse, à un diamant dans sa gangue. Lorsqu'elle est extraite de la terre la pierre n'a aucune beauté; la gangue qui l'entoure en cache la splendeur intérieure, et avant que le diamant ne devienne un joyau, il doit être poli sur la dure meule. Chaque passage lui enlève une partie de sa gangue et taille une facette à travers laquelle la lumière entre et se réfracte sous un angle différent de celui des autres facettes.

Ainsi en est-il de l'Ego; tel un diamant dans sa gangue, il entre à l'école de l'expérience, le pèlerinage à travers la matière, et chaque vie ici-bas est un polissage sur la meule. Chaque vie à l'école de l'expérience enlève à l'Ego un peu de sa rudesse, et permet à la lumière de l'intelligence de se réfracter sous un angle nouveau, donnant une expérience différente; et de même que les angles de réfraction diffèrent d'une facette à l'autre du diamant, ainsi le tempérament de l'Ego est différent dans chaque vie. Dans chacune de celles-ci, nous ne pouvons exprimer qu'une petite partie de notre nature spirituelle, réaliser qu'une minime portion de nos possibilités divines, mais chaque vie tend à arrondir nos angles, à équilibrer notre tempérament. En fait, c'est le travail sur le tempérament qui est la partie principale de notre leçon, car le but à atteindre est la maîtrise de soi. Comme le dit Goethe: 

```
"De chaque pouvoir qui enchaîne le monde entier, 
l'homme se libère par la maîtrise de soi."
```

### <h3 id="question-10">Question 10</h3>

Le corps du désir est-il sujet à la maladie, a-t-il besoin de nourriture et de soin?

RÉPONSE - Dans une certaine mesure, oui, pendant la vie terrestre; c'est-à- dire que toute maladie apparaît d'abord dans le corps du désir et dans le corps vital, dont la texture s'amenuise de telle sorte qu'ils n'assimilent plus le fluide vital autant qu'à l'ordinaire. C'est alors que le corps physique tombe malade. Lorsque la guérison survient, l'état des véhicules supérieurs s'améliore avant que la convalescence ne se manifeste dans le Monde Physique.

Toutefois, si notre correspondant a dans l'esprit les conditions d'après-vie, la chose est différente. Bien qu'une personne puisse être malade ici-bas, alitée pendant des années peut-être et incapable de se mouvoir, dès après sa mort lorsqu'elle se sent allégée de son corps physique, il y a immédiatement une sensation de soulagement, un sentiment de joie et de légèreté qui lui est inhabituel; et elle comprend soudain qu'elle ne souffre plus et qu'elle peut aller et venir à sa guise. Si elle comprend ces nouvelles conditions, elle saura aussi qu'il ne lui est plus nécessaire d'absorber des aliments, car le corps du désir se passe de toute nourriture. Bien des gens ignorent ces faits pourtant, et cela explique pourquoi nous trouvons dans les régions inférieures du Monde du Désir des gens qui parfois s'affairent encore aux soins du ménage. De là viennent les histoires des investigateurs spiritualistes qui ont rencontré ces conditions dans le Monde Invisible; et cela justifie aussi une grande partie de ce que raconte George du Maurier sur la vie de Peter Ibbetson et de la comtesse de Towers, dans son roman qui porte le nom du héros (traduit en français chez Gallimard). Nous recommandons la lecture de cet ouvrage car il illustre bien la façon dont la mémoire subconsciente opère, lorsque le héros traite des faits de son enfance, et des conditions réelles dans les régions inférieures du Monde Invisible où se passent ses expériences avec la comtesse.

### <h3 id="question-11">Question 11</h3>

Comment se fait-il qu'après avoir expié tous les péchés au Purgatoire, il faille, à la renaissance, souffrir à nouveau en vertu de la Loi de Cause à Effet pour les péchés d'une vie précédente?

RÉPONSE - Il y a deux activités distinctes au Purgatoire. Il y a d'abord l'extirpation des mauvaises habitudes. Par exemple, l'ivrogne désire boire tout autant qu'avant sa mort, mais maintenant il n'a plus d'estomac ni de tube digestif pour contenir l'alcool et, bien qu'il puisse se rendre dans des cabarets, pénétrer même à l'intérieur des tonneaux de whisky et se baigner dans l'alcool, rien de tout cela ne lui procure de satisfaction, car il n'y a pas là de vapeurs semblables à celles qui se produisent dans l'estomac par la combustion chimique. Alors pour lui, c'est le supplice de Tantale: "de l'eau, de l'eau partout, mais pas une goutte à boire".

Mais comme dans ce monde le désir s'éteint, lorsque nous comprenons qu'il ne peut pas être assouvi, ainsi avec le temps l'ivrogne est guéri de son désir de boire du fait qu'il ne peut obtenir aucun alcool, et il renaît dépourvu de mal en ce qui concerne ce vice particulier. Cependant, il doit surmonter consciemment ce vice, et c'est pourquoi à un certain moment la tentation viendra sur son chemin. Lorsqu'il sera adulte, un camarade pourra lui demander de "venir boire un verre". Alors tout dépend du fait qu'il cède ou non. S'il cède, il pèche à nouveau et devra être purifié de nouveau, et cela jusqu'à ce que les souffrances accumulées de l'existence purgatorielle répétée le dégoûtent de l'alcool. Ayant alors triomphé consciemment de la tentation, il n'aura plus à endurer de tourment de cette source.

En ce qui concerne le mal fait à autrui, par exemple, si nous avons été cruels envers un enfant confié à nos soins, si nous l'avons battu, affamé ou maltraité de toute autre façon, les scènes où nous avons mal agi auront été enregistrées sur l'atome-germe du coeur et se graveront par la suite sur le corps du désir. Quand le panorama de notre vie se déroulera en sens inverse, il apportera à nouveau ces scènes devant notre conscience. Nous éprouverons alors à notre tour tous les tourments que nous aurons infligés à notre victime; nous ressentirons tous les coups que nous lui avons portés, les angoisses et les humiliations que nous lui avons fait subir, et chaque souffrance dont nous l'avons accablé. Lorsque, dans une vie suivante, nous rencontrerons ce même enfant, nous aurons l'occasion de lui faire autant de bien que nous lui avons jadis fait de mal. Si nous agissons ainsi, tant mieux pour nous. Mais si notre ancienne hostilité s'affirme comme auparavant, nous recevrons alors dans notre prochain Purgatoire de nouveaux coups de fouet qui nous apprendront finalement que nous devons être compatissants envers ceux qui nous sont confiés. Ainsi nous ne souffrons pas à nouveau pour les péchés d'une vie précédente; nous renaissons innocents grâce au ministère bienfaisant du Purgatoire, et toute mauvaise action que nous commettons est un acte de libre arbitre. Mais les tentations sont placées devant nous pour vérifier si l'épuration a été suffisante pour nous enseigner les leçons dont nous avions besoin, et c'est notre privilège de céder ou de rester fort et ferme dans le bien.

### <h3 id="question-12">Question 12</h3>

La conscience est-elle la voix de Dieu ou celle de notre Ange Gardien?

RÉPONSE - Lorsqu'à la mort l'esprit quitte le corps, le panorama de sa vie écoulée se déroule devant lui durant les trois jours et demi qui suivent cette séparation. Ces images se gravent dans le corps du désir et forment la base de la vie au Purgatoire et au Premier Ciel, qui se trouvent dans le Monde du Désir. La vie est reproduite en images qui se déroulent en arrière, de manière à ce que les scènes qui se sont produites juste avant la mort se présentent les premières; et ainsi de suite, en remontant jusqu'à l'enfance et à la première enfance. Au Purgatoire, seules les scènes où l'âme a mal agi sont reproduites, et l'âme se sent pour ainsi dire dans la peau de la personne à laquelle elle a fait tort; et elle souffre à son tour comme ont souffert ceux à qui elle a fait du mal durant la vie sur terre. L'enregistrement de ces souffrances se grave de manière indélébile sur l'atome-germe, seule partie du corps physique que l'âme emporte avec elle et qu'elle conserve de vie en vie. C'est en quelque sorte le "livre" de l'"Ange de Justice", et comme la souffrance causée par un certain acte a été gravée au Purgatoire sur cet atome-germe, il est évident que lorsque dans une nouvelle vie des circonstances similaires se présentent et que les vieilles tentations viennent à nous, la souffrance endurée à cause de la mauvaise action est présente dans l'atome-germe pour nous avertir que telle direction donnée à une action est fausse. C'est la "voix de la conscience", et si la souffrance endurée au Purgatoire a été suffisamment intense, nous aurons le pouvoir de résister quelle que soit la tentation qui se présente à nous. Si au contraire, pour diverses raisons, la souffrance n'a pas été suffisante, il se peut que dans une autre vie nous cédions en permanence ou temporairement aux mêmes tentations qui nous ont coûté des souffrances dans des vies précédentes; il peut nous arriver de céder en dépit des murmures de notre conscience. Mais une fois revenus au Purgatoire, nous aurons des souffrances accrues, causées par le fait que nous avons cédé à la tentation, et les effets cumulatifs de cette souffrance seront finalement suffisants pour nous détourner de ce qui nous fait souffrir.

Lorsqu'une tentation s'est présentée à nous au cours d'une de nos vies terrestres et que nous y avons consciemment résisté, nous avons appris la leçon voulue, et la conscience a atteint son but.

Pour répondre à la question posée, nous pouvons donc dire que la conscience est le souvenir que l'esprit garde des souffrances passées, causées par les erreurs faites dans les vies précédentes.

### <h3 id="question-13">Question 13</h3>

Qu'est-ce que le génie?

RÉPONSE - Selon l'opinion généralement admise, le génie semble être un accident. La théorie de l'hérédité ne saurait l'expliquer car parfois ce sont des parents très ordinaires qui donnent naissance à un génie, alors que des personnes très instruites intellectuellement mettent au monde des idiots. Il arrive aussi qu'on trouve dans la même famille des idiots et des génies. En fait, on peut dire que la folie et le génie sont les extrêmes où les qualités mentales de l'humanité se rejoignent.

Si nous essayons d'expliquer le génie par l'hérédité, nous pouvons nous demander pourquoi un homme comme Edison n'est pas issu d'une longue lignée d'inventeurs dont il serait le fleuron. Mais nous trouvons que dans tous les cas où un génie s'est manifesté, une déduction avec référence à une loi quelconque n'est pas possible, si nous considérons le fait du simple point de vue matériel.

Si nous nous référons à la loi de cause à effet et à sa loi jumelle, la loi de renaissance, pour éclairer le problème, la chose est très différente Cette théorie affirme que la vie sur terre est une école d'expérience; qu'à chaque nouvelle naissance, nous renaissons avec les expériences accumulées de toutes nos vies passées qui sont nos outils essentiels, notre capital; que quelques- uns d'entre nous ont suivi cette école d'expérience durant de nombreuses vies et ont récolté abondamment. Peut-être avons-nous développé plus que les autres une faculté particulière, ce qui fait que nous sommes devenus très habiles à la suite d'efforts dans une direction précise. C'est cela le génie.

Pour pouvoir exprimer quelques-unes de nos facultés, la musique par exemple, il est nécessaire que nous ayons certaines caractéristiques physiques tels des doigts effilés, un système nerveux délicat et, surtout, une oreille particulièrement développée afin de pouvoir nous exprimer en tant que musiciens. De tels matériaux requis pour l'expression de la musique ne se trouvent pas n'importe où, mais la loi d'association attirera naturellement un musicien vers d'autres musiciens, et là, il trouvera à portée de main les matériaux avec lesquels il pourra se construire un corps tel que le nécessite l'expression de son talent. C'est pourquoi il semble parfois que les musiciens naissent en familles; par exemple, vingt-neuf musiciens sont nés dans la famille de Bach en deux cent cinquante ans.

### <h3 id="question-14">Question 14</h3>

Une âme née dans un corps de femme ne pourra-t-elle jamais habiter un corps d'homme? Quel intervalle y a-t-il entre deux incarnations?

RÉPONSE - Non, l'esprit est bissexué et s'exprime habituellement dans ses vies successives, alternativement comme homme et comme femme. Il y a cependant parfois des cas où, selon la loi de cause à effet, il est préférable qu'un esprit revienne durant plusieurs vies successives dans un corps de même sexe.

La loi est celle-ci:

A mesure que le Soleil recule dans les douze constellations par le mouvement que nous appelons la précession des équinoxes, le climat de la terre, la flore et la faune se modifient lentement, réalisant ainsi un environnement différent pour la race humaine, au cours des âges successifs. Le Soleil met un peu plus de deux mille ans pour parcourir l'un des signes par précession, et durant ce laps de temps l'esprit renaît généralement deux fois, alternativement homme et femme. Les changements qui surviennent au cours du millier d'années qui sépare les incarnations ne sont pas si grands que l'Esprit ne puisse extraire les expériences que ce milieu offre du double point de vue masculin et féminin.

Il est des cas, cependant, où cet intervalle est aussi changé. Ces lois ne sont pas inflexibles, comme le sont celles des Mèdes et des Perses, mais elles sont administrées par de Grandes Intelligences au profit de l'humanité, de manière à ce que leurs conditions puissent être modifiées pour répondre aux exigences des cas individuels. Par exemple, pour le musicien. Il ne peut trouver partout le matériel dont est construit son corps. Il a besoin d'une aide spéciale pour construire les trois canaux semi-circulaires de son oreille, de telle façon qu'ils soient axés aussi exactement que possible sur les trois dimensions de l'espace; il en est de même pour construire les fibres si délicates de Corti, car la faculté de distinguer les nuances des sons dépend de leur conformation.

En pareil cas, lorsqu'une famille de musiciens avec laquelle il a des liens est en état de donner naissance à un enfant, il peut être amené à renaître là, bien que son séjour dans le Monde Céleste doive normalement se prolonger encore d'une centaine d'années, car peut-être, une autre opportunité peut ne pas se présenter avant deux ou trois cents ans, si la loi était strictement appliquée. Il est alors évident qu'un tel homme est en avance sur son temps et qu'il n'est pas apprécié par la génération dans laquelle il vit. Il est incompris, mais cela vaut mieux que de se trouver en retard sur son époque, ce qui aurait pu être le cas s'il était né plus tard.

Cela nous explique pourquoi un génie dont le talent aura été méconnu de son vivant se verra apprécié à sa juste valeur par les générations suivantes, mieux capables de le comprendre.

### <h3 id="question-15">Question 15</h3>

Lorsqu'un homme paie ce qu'il doit, prend soin de sa famille et vit une vie morale, n'est-il pas en règle lorsqu'il passe dans l'au-delà?

RÉPONSE - Non, car il lui est demandé quelque chose de plus, et ceux qui ont vécu comme vous le dites mènent après leur mort, dans le Monde du Désir, une existence peu enviable. Ils doivent naturellement être considérés du point de vue de cette vie seulement. Mais actuellement il nous est demandé de cultiver au moins quelques tendances altruistes afin de progresser au-delà de notre degré présent d'évolution.

C'est dans la quatrième région du Monde du Désir que se trouvent, après la mort, les personnes qui ont négligé les devoirs plus élevés. Il s'y trouve l'homme d'affaires qui a toujours tenu ses engagements, qui a agi honnêtement avec chacun; qui a travaillé en bon citoyen à l'amélioration matérielle de sa ville et de son pays, qui a donné des gages corrects à ses employés, a traité sa femme et sa famille avec considération en leur accordant tous les avantages possibles, etc. Par eux, il se peut même qu'il ait fait bâtir une église ou du moins qu'il ait fait preuve de générosité pour celle-ci, ou il peut avoir construit des bibliothèques et fondé des institutions, etc. Mais il ne s'est pas donné lui-même. S'il s'est intéressé à une église, c'est seulement dans l'intérêt de sa famille ou par souci de respectabilité; il n'y a pas mis son coeur car tout son coeur était dans ses affaires, pour faire de l'argent ou atteindre une position sociale en vue.

A son entrée dans le Monde du Désir, après sa mort, cet homme est trop bon pour aller au Purgatoire, et pas assez pour aller au ciel. Ayant agi avec droiture envers chacun, n'ayant nui à personne, il n'a rien à expier. Mais il n'a pas non plus fait de bien, qui puisse lui donner une vie au Premier Ciel où le bien de sa vie passée est assimilé. C'est pourquoi il se trouve dans la quatrième région, entre le Ciel et l'Enfer, pourrait-on dire. La quatrième région est au centre du Monde du désir et les sentiments y sont très intenses; l'homme continue à éprouver un vif désir pour les affaires, mais là il ne peut ni acheter ni vendre, et ainsi sa vie est au plus haut point d'une terrible monotonie.

Tout ce qu'il a donné aux églises, aux institutions compte pour rien à cause de son manque de coeur. C'est seulement lorsque nous donnons par amour que le don servira à apporter de la joie dans l'au-delà. Ce n'est pas la valeur du don qui importe, mais l'esprit dans lequel nous le faisons; il est donc au pouvoir de chacun de nous de donner et de bénéficier nous-mêmes du don ainsi qu'autrui. Donner de l'argent sans discernement peut cependant amener les gens à être dépensiers et à retomber dans la misère, sauf si une sympathie qui vient du coeur est aussi donnée; en aidant les gens à croire en eux et à prendre un nouveau départ dans la vie, avec une ardeur renouvelée, en nous donnant nous-mêmes, par les services rendus à l'humanité, nous amassons des trésors dans les cieux et donnons bien plus que de l'or. Le Christ a dit "Vous aurez toujours les pauvres avec vous" (Marc 14/7). Il se peut que nous ne soyons pas capables de les faire passer de l'indigence à la richesse, ce qui pourrait d'ailleurs n'être pas très bon pour eux, mais nous pouvons les encourager à apprendre la leçon qu'enseigne la pauvreté; nous pouvons les aider à voir la vie sous un angle meilleur. A moins que l'homme, objet de la présente réponse, n'agisse de cette manière, il ne sera pas "en règle", comme vous dites, lorsqu'il passera dans l'au-delà; il souffrira de cette terrible monotonie afin d'apprendre qu'il doit garnir sa vie de choses de vraie valeur, et ainsi, dans une vie suivante, sa conscience le pressera de faire quelque chose de mieux que d'amasser de l'argent, sans toutefois négliger ses devoirs matériels, car cela est aussi mauvais que de dédaigner les efforts spirituels.

### <h3 id="question-16">Question 16</h3>

Certains soutiennent que nous avons le droit de penser comme bon nous semble et que nous ne sommes pas responsables de nos pensées. Est-ce exact du point de vue occulte?

RÉPONSE - Non, pas du tout; c'est plutôt le contraire, et il n'est pas nécessaire de nous référer à l'occultisme pour cela; nous trouvons cette idée exprimée par le Christ dans le Sermon sur la Montagne où Il nous dit que "Quiconque regarde une femme avec convoitise a déjà commis l'adultère en son coeur", et si nous nous pénétrons de cette idée que "l'homme est tel qu'il pense en son coeur", nous aurons de la vie une conception bien plus claire que si nous tenons compte uniquement des actes des hommes, car chaque acte est la conséquence d'une pensée qui l'a précédé, mais ces pensées ne sont pas toujours les nôtres.

Lorsque, de deux diapasons donnant le même ton, nous en frappons un, l'autre se mettra aussi à vibrer en sympathie. De même, si nous émettons une pensée et qu'une autre personne de notre entourage ait suivi le même courant de pensée, notre pensée s'unit à la sienne et la renforce pour le bien ou pour le mal selon sa nature. La pièce intitulée "L'heure du sortilège" (The Witching Hour) n'est pas une oeuvre de pure imagination. Le héros tente d'aider un criminel sur le point d'être arrêté, à s'échapper de l'Etat du Kentucky dont il vient d'assassiner le gouverneur. Le héros de la pièce, homme d'une puissance de pensée exceptionnelle, sent qu'il a pu influencer le meurtrier. Il raconte à sa soeur comment, avant que le crime ne fût commis, il avait pensé précisément à la façon dont il serait possible de le perpétrer, et c'est exactement de cette manière que les choses se sont passées. Il a l'impression que ses pensées ont été captées par le cerveau du meurtrier et qu'elles lui ont montré la manière de commettre le meurtre.

Lorsque nous faisons partie d'un jury et que nous voyons le criminel devant nous, nous considérons uniquement son acte; nous n'avons pas connaissance de la pensée qui l'a incité à agir. Si nous avions l'habitude d'avoir de mauvaises pensées, des pensées malveillantes à l'égard d'une personne ou une autre, ces pensées ont pu être séduisantes pour ce criminel et, de même qu'une solution proche du point de saturation se solidifie si on lui ajoute un seul cristal, ainsi, si un homme a saturé son cerveau de pensées de meurtre, il se peut que la pensée que nous émettons soit la goutte qui fait déborder le vase, détruisant la dernière barrière qui l'aurait empêché de commettre son acte.

C'est pourquoi nos pensées ont une importance bien plus considérable que nos actes, car si nous voulons seulement penser correctement, nous agirons toujours correctement. Nul ne peut avoir des pensées d'amour envers ses semblables, chercher les moyens de leur venir en aide spirituellement, mentalement ou matériellement, sans concrétiser aussi ces pensées par des actes, un jour ou l'autre dans sa vie. Et si nous cultivons de telles pensées, nous verrons bientôt le Soleil rayonner autour de nous; nous verrons que les autres nous accueillent avec les mêmes dispositions d'esprit que nous avons à leur égard. Et si nous sommes conscients que le corps du désir (qui entoure chacun de nous et s'étend à quarante ou cinquante centimètres au-delà de la périphérie du corps physique) contient tous ces sentiments et toutes ces émotions, nous rencontrerions les gens d'une manière différente, car nous comprendrions que tout ce que nous voyons est vu à travers l'atmosphère que nous avons créée autour de nous et qui colore tout ce que nous apercevons chez les autres.

Il en résulte que si nous voyons bassesse et mesquinerie chez les autres, nous ferions bien de regarder en nous-mêmes afin de nous assurer que ce n'est pas l'atmosphère à travers laquelle nous les considérons qui les colore de cette façon. Regardons si ces qualités indésirables ne se trouvent pas en nous-mêmes, puis commençons à y porter remède. Un être mesquin et malveillant irradie ces qualités autour de lui, et tous ceux qu'il rencontrera lui paraîtront mesquins et malveillants, car il suscite chez les autres les qualités qu'il manifeste, selon le principe d'affinité qui fait vibrer un diapason à l'unisson d'un autre, de même ton, que l'on frappe. Si d'autre part nous cultivons une attitude sereine, une attitude libre de convoitise, sincèrement honnête et secourable, nous susciterons ce qu'il y a de meilleur chez autrui. C'est pourquoi soyons conscients que ce n'est pas avant que nous ayons cultivé en nous les meilleures qualités, que nous pouvons nous attendre à les trouver chez les autres. Nous sommes donc, en vérité, responsables de nos pensées, nous sommes les gardiens de nos frères, car ainsi que nous pensons lorsque nous les rencontrons, tels nous leur apparaissons, et ils reflètent notre attitude. En application du principe qui vient d'être exposé, si nous désirons obtenir de l'aide pour cultiver ces meilleures qualités, recherchons la compagnie de personnes qui sont bonnes, car leur attitude d'esprit sera d'une aide immense pour susciter en nous les plus belles qualités.

### <h3 id="question-17">Question 17</h3>

Si quelqu'un est sans cesse tourmenté par de mauvaises pensées qui assaillent son intellect, bien qu'il les combatte sans répit, existe-t-il pour lui un moyen de purifier son intellect, de façon qu'il n'ait plus que des pensées bonnes et pures?

RÉPONSE - Oui, ce moyen existe et il est des plus simples. Dans sa question, le demandeur nous révèle la principale difficulté en disant qu'il lutte constamment contre ses mauvaises pensées. Un exemple nous éclairera sur ce point.

Supposons que nous éprouvions une antipathie particulière pour une personne que nous rencontrons dans la rue tous les jours, et même plusieurs fois par jour. Si, à chaque rencontre, nous nous arrêtons pour l'invectiver sous prétexte qu'elle est sur notre chemin, qu'elle ne se tient pas loin de nos regards, nous jetons à chaque fois de l'huile sur le feu et attisons la haine de cette personne qui, pour nous narguer, est bien capable de nous guetter au passage. La sympathie aussi bien que l'antipathie ont tendance a attirer une pensée ou une idée à nous, et la force de pensée que nous ajoutons pour combattre les mauvaises pensées les maintiennent en vie et les ramènent plus souvent à notre intellect, de la même manière que nos invectives envers la personne que nous n'aimons pas l'incitent à se mettre sur notre chemin. Mais si au lieu de combattre cette personne, nous adoptons la tactique de l'indifférence, si nous tournons notre tête dans une autre direction lorsque nous la rencontrons dans la rue, elle en aura bientôt assez de se mettre sur notre chemin; il en est de même des mauvaises pensées qui pénètrent dans nos intellects. Si nous nous en détournons avec indifférence et dirigeons nos intellects vers quelque chose de bien, vers un idéal, nous constaterons qu'en peu de temps nous sommes libérés de leur compagnie et n'avons plus que les bonnes pensées que nous désirons entretenir.

### <h3 id="question-18">Question 18</h3>

Si la femme est une émanation de l'homme, selon l'histoire de la côte d'Adam, sera-t-elle réabsorbée lors du retour final à l'unité, perdant ainsi son individualité dans la divinité masculine?

RÉPONSE - L'histoire de la côte d'Adam (Genèse 2/21-22) est l'un des exemples qui trahit une grande ignorance de la part des traducteurs de la Bible - qui n'avaient aucune connaissance occulte - au sujet de la langue des Hébreux qui, lorsqu'elle était écrite ne séparait pas les mots les uns des autres, et qui n'avait pas de points indiquant les voyelles. En insérant les voyelles à différents endroits et en divisant les mots différemment, des sens variés du même texte peuvent être obtenus en de nombreuses places de celui-ci. C'est ainsi qu'un mot de ce texte, accentué d'une certaine manière, se lira "tsad" et d'une autre façon "tsela". Les traducteurs, lisant que Dieu avait prélevé quelque chose sur le côté ("tsela") d'Adam, se sont trouvés embarrassés pour s'avoir ce que c'était, et peut-être ont-ils pensé que c'est enlever une côte ("tsad") qui aurait causé le moins de mal à Adam, de là cette histoire ridicule.

En fait, l'homme était à l'origine semblable aux Dieux, "fait à leur image", masculin et féminin, donc hermaphrodite, et plus tard, un côté lui fut enlevé, de sorte que l'humanité fut divisée en deux sexes. On peut ajouter que le premier organe à s'être développé tel qu'il est actuellement a été l'organe féminin, le côté féminin ayant toujours existé en toute chose avant le côté masculin, qui vint plus tard, et,selon la loi d'évolution qui dit que "les premiers seront les derniers", le sexe féminin subsistera en tant que sexe distinct, plus longtemps que le sexe masculin; le demandeur est donc dans l'erreur la plus complète quant à sa supposition. C'est le masculin qui sera absorbé dans le féminin. Maintenant déjà, on peut observer que l'organe masculin se contracte graduellement à sa base, et il finira par disparaître.

Quant à imaginer que la femme perde son individualité, une telle chose est impossible, puisque le but de l'évolution est justement que nous devenions des individus soi-conscients et distincts durant l'évolution, soi-conscients et unis entre les intervalles de manifestation.

### <h3 id="question-19">Question 19</h3>

Pourquoi la femme a-t-elle souffert de l'inégalité des sexes, a- t-elle été traitée en inférieure, a-t-elle été victime de l'injustice depuis le début de l'existence humaine sur ce plan terrestre?

RÉPONSE - Avant tout, nous devons nous souvenir que l'Esprit n'est ni masculin ni féminin mais qu'il se manifeste de l'une et l'autre manière, alternativement, en général. Nous avons tous été des hommes, et nous avons tous été des femmes. C'est pourquoi il ne peut être question d'inégalité si nous considérons la vie d'un point de vue très large. Au cours de chaque ère, l'Esprit ne peut apprendre certaines leçons qu'en adoptant le point de vue d'une femme, alors que d'autres leçons ne seront apprises qu'en renaissant dans un corps masculin, d'où la nécessité de changer de sexe. Evidemment, il arrive parfois que, pour certaines raisons, un Ego ait revêtu, pendant plusieurs vies successives, un corps masculin; lorsqu'enfin cet Ego renaît dans un corps de femme, le désaccord peut être considérable. Dans ce cas, nous aurons une femme hommasse, de tournure et de caractère. Par contre, il est possible qu'un Esprit ait occupé un corps de femme pendant plusieurs vies terrestres consécutives et, lorsqu'il revêt la forme masculine, il présente des manières et une nature efféminées. Mais même en retenant l'hypothèse des renaissances alternées, un bon nombre d'entre nous étaient probablement incarnés à Rome dans le sexe opposé; en prenant en considération la loi de cause à effet, et en songeant à la manière dont les femmes étaient traitées par les hommes à cette époque, on comprend que ces femmes Romaines, si elles sont maintenant incarnées en tant qu'hommes, ne soient guère disposées à faire de grandes concessions à leurs maîtres d'autrefois.

### <h3 id="question-20">Question 20</h3>

Pourquoi les souffrances de Marguerite, allant jusqu'à l'emprisonnement et à la peine de mort, ont-elles été si peu proportionnées à celles de Faust qui, sans être châtié, a continué sa vie librement à la poursuite du bonheur?

RÉPONSE - Cette question se rapporte à un mythe qui nous vient du fond des âges. Or, contrairement à l'opinion courante, les mythes ne sont pas des histoires inventées de toutes pièces, mais des vérités voilées qui révèlent en symboles, de grands principes spirituels. Ces mythes ont été donné à l'humanité enfant pour la même raison que nous donnons à nos enfants, dans des contes de fées et des livres d'images, des enseignements moraux qui se gravent sur leur intellect d'enfant mieux que ne saurait le faire un enseignement intellectuel.

Goethe, qui était un initié, a traité le mythe de Faust d'une façon merveilleusement révélatrice, et la clé du problème se trouve dans le prologue qui se joue au Ciel, et qui rappelle le début du Livre de Job. Les Fils de Dieu paraissent devant le Trône et le Diable est parmi eux, car il est, lui aussi, un des Fils de Dieu. Il reçoit la permission d'essayer de séduire Faust, afin de réveiller ses activités spirituelles et de fortifier sa vertu. Nous faisons l'erreur de considérer comme synonymes l'innocence et la vertu; nous naissons tous innocents, nous arrivons sur cette terre purifiés de tout péché, mais avec certaines tendances qui peuvent être développées en vices; il est donc nécessaire que nous soyons mis à l'épreuve au cours de chaque vie afin de voir si nous allons céder à la tentation et adopter le vice, ou résister fermement et développer la vertu. Faust est tenté, et il succombe, mais ensuite il se repent sincèrement et transmue les forces du mal en bien, aussi finit-il par être sauvé. La repentance et la réforme de son caractère, avant de mourir, ont assuré son salut, sa passion impure pour Marguerite ayant fait place à son amour pure pour Hélène. Marguerite cède aussi à la tentation, elle se repent et est sauvée par le pardon des péchés. Ainsi, dans le cas de Faust, il s'agit du salut par les oeuvres. Grâce à son énergie qui domine les forces du mal, il construit un nouveau pays, un pays où des gens libres pourront vivre dans de meilleures conditions; il cherche à élever l'humanité sur un plan supérieur et, par cette action, par son travail désintéressé pour autrui, il est racheté des pouvoirs du mal. Dans le cas de Marguerite, le salut vient de la prière et de la repentance. Ainsi nous avons dans ce drame, tel qu'il est représenté par Goethe, un symbole parfait de l'Enseignement de la Sagesse Occidentale, qui englobe à la fois le pardon des péchés et l'expiation d'une mauvaise action par l'action juste correspondante. La mort est quelque chose qui nous concerne tous, et la souffrance inhérente à chacun des deux cas n'est certainement pas moindre pour Faust puisqu'elle a été prolongée durant de nombreuses années, alors que pour Marguerite la vie a pris fin beaucoup plus rapidement. La seule différence est que Faust a triomphé consciemment du mal et que dans une vie future, il sera à l'abri de la tentation, tandis que le cas de Marguerite est problématique. Dans une prochaine vie ici-bas, elle sera soumise à la tentation afin de déterminer si, oui ou non, elle a développé la force de caractère requise pour résister au mal et s'attacher au bien. 

### <h3 id="question-21">Question 21</h3>

Y a-t-il dans l'Ancien ou le Nouveau Testament un passage dans lequel il est dit aux hommes de se marier et ensuite de vivre comme frère et soeur, en tout temps et en toutes circonstances? Si cela ne figure pas dans la Bible, pourquoi l'enseignez-vous?

RÉPONSE - Les Sémites Originaux ont été la cinquième des races Atlantéennes. Ils avaient échappé à l'engloutissement de l'Atlantide par les eaux, qui est relaté, de diverses façons, dans les récits de Noé et de Moïse. Ils devaient aller dans une Terre Promise, et il ne s'agissait pas de l'insignifiante petite Palestine, mais de la Terre entière telle qu'elle est maintenant constituée. Cette Terre leur était promise, parce qu'elle subissait les changements accompagnant habituellement l'arrivée d'une nouvelle race destinée à en prendre possession. Les inondations avaient détruit la civilisation Atlantéenne, et c'est dans le désert de Gobi, en Asie Centrale, qu'ont erré longtemps ceux qui ont formé le noyau des races Aryennes actuelles.

A l'époque où ce noyau devait devenir une race destinée à peupler le monde, il est évident que la natalité était un facteur d'une importance capitale. Chacun considérait alors de son devoir de donner naissance à une postérité extrêmement nombreuse. Mais maintenant, nous ne vivons plus à cette époque; le monde est très peuplé et les Egos en voie de renaître trouvent aisément l'occasion de le faire. Jamais nous n'avons préconisé un célibat général, ou dit que les gens devaient se marier puis vivre en tout temps comme frère et soeur; mais nous avons enseigné que les gens mariés, selon les circonstances qui leur sont propres, devaient aider à perpétuer la race humaine. C'est à dire, si l'homme et la femme en sont tous deux physiquement, moralement et mentalement capables; lorsqu'ils possèdent un foyer où un Ego en voie de renaître puisse obtenir l'occasion de s'incarner et de faire des expériences, ils devraient s'offrir eux-mêmes en vivant sacrifice sur l'autel de l'humanité et donner la substance de leurs corps afin de fournir le véhicule nécessaire à un Ego ,l'invitant à entrer dans leur foyer, comme ils inviteraient un hôte très cher, et reconnaissants d'être en mesure de faire pour lui ce que d'autres ont fait pour eux. Mais, lorsque l'acte de fécondation a eu lieu, ils devraient s'abstenir d'autres rapports sexuels jusqu'à ce qu'ils sentent que les conditions sont à nouveau remplies pour avoir un autre enfant. Tel est l'Enseignement des Rosicruciens concernant les relations idéales entre mari et femme. Ils affirment que la fonction créatrice ne devrait pas avoir pour objet le plaisir des sens, mais la perpétuation de la race, but auquel cette fonction est naturellement destinée. Ceci est une condition idéale et elle peut être hors de portée de la plupart des gens actuellement, tout comme l'injonction d'aimer nos ennemis; mais sans idéals élevés, nous ne ferons pas de progrès.

### <h3 id="question-22">Question 22</h3>

Chaque âme ne possède-t-elle pas une âme-soeur de toute éternité? Si oui, n'est-il pas préférable de rester célibataire pendant un millier d'années plutôt que d'épouser la personne qui ne nous convient pas?

RÉPONSE - De même que la lumière est réfractée en sept couleurs formant le spectre solaire lorsqu'elle traverse notre atmosphère, ainsi les Esprits Vierges qui sont différenciés en Dieu, sont réfractés en sept grands rayons. Chaque classe d'esprits est placée directement sous la conduite et la domination de l'un des Sept Esprits devant le Trône, qui sont les Esprits planétaires ou Anges Stellaires. Au cours de leur renaissances successives, les Esprits Vierges se mélangent entre eux afin d'acquérir les expériences les plus variées; néanmoins, ceux qui sont émanés du même Ange Stellaire sont toujours des âmes-soeurs, et lorsqu'ils recherchent la vie supérieure, ils doivent entrer dans la voie de l'initiation par une "loge" composée de membres du même rayon dont ils ont tiré leur origine, pour retourner, de là, à leur source originelle. C'est pourquoi il y a sept sortes d'écoles des Mystères, une pour chaque classe d'esprits. C'est aussi pour cela que Jésus a dit à ses disciples "Votre Père et le mien". Nul n'aurait pu être en contact aussi étroit avec Lui que l'ont été Ses disciples, à moins d'appartenir au même rayon.

Comme tous les autres mystères, cette belle doctrine a été avilie et rabaissée à une idée physique et matérielle telle la conception populaire des âmes soeurs et des affinités électives qui veut que l'un des partenaires soit homme et l'autre femme, chacun étant souvent marié à un autre conjoint. Dans de tels cas, la doctrine des âmes-soeurs sert souvent d'excuse à une fugue ou à un adultère. C'est une abominable perversion. Chaque Esprit est complet en lui- même, il se revêt alternativement d'un corps masculin et féminin, à différents moments, afin d'apprendre les leçons de la vie, et ce n'est que durant la phase actuelle de son développement que les caractéristiques dues aux sexes existent. L'Ego existait avant les sexes, et il perdurera après que cette phase de sa propre manifestation aura disparu.

### <h3 id="question-23">Question 23</h3>

Est-ce mal de se marier entre cousins du premier, du second ou du troisième degré? Si oui, pourquoi?

RÉPONSE - Le but du mariage est la perpétuation de la race, et l'enfant sera conforme à la nature physique des parents, plus leur milieu. Nous voyons par exemple que les émigrants venus se fixer en Amérique sont différents de leurs enfants, et que les enfants qui naissent ici aux Etats-Unis sont différents des enfants nés en Europe. Par exemple, les Siciliens à tête allongée donnent naissance à des enfant à tête plus arrondie, alors que les juifs à tête arrondie ont des enfants à tête plus ovale, montrant ainsi dans toutes les races une tendance à s'amalgamer et à former une nouvelle race Américaine.

Ces changements ne sont pas l'effet du hasard. Les grands guides de l'humanité ont constamment pour but de déterminer les conditions propres à la production de certains types, car c'est la seule façon de développer les facultés nécessaires au progrès de l'Esprit, et il y eut un temps où il était nécessaire à l'évolution de l'Ego que les mariages se fassent dans la famille. A ce moment là l'humanité n'était pas aussi évoluée et individualisée qu'elle l'est maintenant. Les hommes étaient gouvernés par un Esprit de famille qui pénétrait dans le sang au moyen de l'air inspiré dans les poumons pour aider l'Ego à gouverner son instrument. Alors l'humanité possédait ce que l'on appelle la seconde vue, et cette seconde vue se trouve encore chez les peuples qui ont continué à beaucoup se marier dans la famille, comme par exemple, les habitants de la Haute Ecosse et les Tziganes.

Mais il était devenu nécessaire que les hommes oublient pour un temps le Monde Spirituel et ne se souviennent d'aucune vie si ce n'est leur existence actuelle. Pour amener ce changement de conscience, les grands guides de l'humanité ont pris diverses mesures, l'une d'elles étant d'interdire les mariages dans la famille. Lorsque nous lisons, au cinquième chapitre de la Genèse, qu'Adam vécut neuf cent ans et que les patriarches ont tous vécu plusieurs siècles, cela ne veut pas dire que les personnes nommées aient vécu elles-mêmes durant le laps de temps mentionné, mais que le sang circulant dans leurs veines était transmis directement à leurs descendants et que ce sang contenait les images de la famille comme le nôtre contient celles de notre vie individuelle, car le sang est le dépôt de toutes les expériences. Ainsi les descendants des familles patriarcales se voyaient comme étant Adam, Mathusalem, etc. Naturellement, avec le temps, ces images ont graduellement pâli et lorsque le souvenir d'Adam a disparu du sang de ses descendants directs, on a dit qu'Adam avait cessé de vivre.

A mesure que l'homme s'individualisait, il a dû apprendre à se tenir debout tout seul sans l'aide de l'esprit de famille. Alors les mariages internationaux furent autorisés ou même ordonnés, et se marier à l'intérieur de la famille ne fut plus permis. C'est ce qui a détruit la clairvoyance. La science a démontré que l'inoculation du sang d'un animal dans les veines d'un autre animal, produit l'hémolyse, ou destruction du sang, action qui tue l'animal inférieur. L'introduction de sang étranger, quelle que soit la manière dont elle s'effectue, tue toujours quelque chose, si ce n'est la forme du moins une faculté, et le sang étranger introduit par mariage a tué la clairvoyance que l'homme primitif possédait. Cette affirmation sur le pouvoir destructeur du sang étranger peut être vérifiée dans le cas des hybrides. Le croisement de l'âne et du cheval donne le mulet, auquel manque la faculté de se reproduire, car n'étant sous la domination ni de l'esprit-.groupe du cheval ni de l'esprit-groupe de l'âne, s'il devait néanmoins se reproduire, cette espèce ne serait sous la domination d'aucun esprit-groupe. Le mulet n'est cependant pas assez évolué pour guider son corps physique sans l'assistance d'un esprit-groupe, et c'est pourquoi la faculté de reproduction est refusée, l'esprit-groupe retenant l'atome-germe fécondant. En ce qui concerne les humains, le cas est différent. Au moment où les mariages entre nations ont été ordonnés, ils en était arrivé au degré où leur conscience individuelle était suffisamment évoluée pour qu'ils soient capables de mener leur barque eux- mêmes. Le temps était venu pour eux de cesser d'être des automates guidés par Dieu, pour devenir des individus capables de se gouverner eux-mêmes. Plus les sangs sont mélangés, moins l'esprit intérieur peut être influencé par l'un ou l'autre des esprits de race ou de famille qui ont influencé nos ancêtres. Ainsi, lorsque nous épousons des étrangers, les Egos qui renaîtront ont les coudées plus franches que si notre conjoint est un cousin.

### <h3 id="question-24">Question 24</h3>

Serait-il sage pour deux personnes de même tempérament de se marier si elles sont nées sous le même signe du zodiaque, en août par exemple?

RÉPONSE - On dit qu'à chaque seconde, un enfant vient au monde (vrai en 1910); il y aurait donc trois mille six cents naissances par heure, quatre-vingt-six mille quatre cents par 24 heures, et plus de deux millions et demi par mois. Si elles devaient avoir le même tempérament et la même destinée, il n'y aurait que douze catégories de personnes correspondant aux douze signes du zodiaque, et pourtant nous savons qu'il n'y a pas deux personnes exactement identiques; il est donc absurde de dire que deux personnes ont le même tempérament parce qu'elles sont nées sous le même signe du zodiaque, ainsi que le détermine le mois de la naissance.

Pour dresser scientifiquement un horoscope, il faut tenir compte du jour et de l'année de la naissance, car les planètes n'arrivent aux mêmes positions relatives que tous les vingt-cinq mille huit cent soixante-huit ans. Il faut prendre également en considération l'heure, et si possible la minute exacte de la naissance, à cause du rapide changement de position de la Lune. Si nous tenons compte du lieu, nous pouvons calculer le signe ascendant qui donne la forme du corps. Nous avons ainsi un horoscope absolument individuel, car le degré du zodiaque se levant à l'horizon Est change toutes les quatre minutes, de sorte que, même dans le cas de jumeaux, il existe une différence.

Donc, pour qu'un astrologue puisse dire si le mariage de deux personnes sera harmonieux ou non, il est nécessaire qu'il calcule leurs deux thèmes astrologiques et s'efforce de découvrir si elles s'accorderont physiquement, moralement et mentalement. Pour cela, il compare les ascendants ou signes qui se lèvent à l'horizon Est, qui indiquent les affinités physiques. Les positions de Mars et de Vénus indiqueront s'ils sont, moralement, de même nature ; puis le Soleil et la Lune montrent les caractéristiques mentales. L'astrologue dispose donc d'un instrument précis pour savoir si deux natures sympathiseront. Toute prédiction basée sur autre chose que sur ces calculs est sans valeur.

### <h3 id="question-25">Question 25</h3>

Quand une personne décédée de mort violente renaît pour mourir dans l'enfance, se trouve-t-elle dans un corps de même sexe ou de sexe opposé? Par exemple, un soldat tué sur le champ de bataille renaît-il comme garçon ou comme fille, ou le sexe n'a-t-il aucune importance quand la seconde vie doit être si courte?

RÉPONSE - Autant que l'auteur ait pu en juger par ses investigations, il semble que la question de sexe n'ait aucune importance dans ce cas. L'Ego saisit l'occasion de renaître là où il la trouve. Tout ce qui importe, c'est que les matériaux nécessaires à la construction des nouveaux véhicules soient rassemblés, de telle sorte que l'impression morale puisse se faire sur le corps du désir durant la vie céleste qui suivra la mort de l'enfant.

Cette question de sexe, à tout prendre, est très élastique, du moins dans le cas de ceux qui ont vécu ce que nous appelons "la vie supérieure", car celle- ci a tendance à rendre le corps vital positif en permanence, si bien que l'atome-germe, logé dans le plexus solaire, attire ainsi automatiquement à lui une quantité toujours croissante d'éther positivement polarisé, de sorte que les éléments constitutifs du corps vital restent positifs, que le corps physique soit masculin ou féminin. C'est pourquoi, dans le cas de personnes dites "avancées", le choix est le plus souvent laissé à l'Ego qui cherche à renaître.

### <h3 id="question-26">Question 26</h3>

Pourquoi dit-on communément que le Noir est marqué du signe de Caïn? S'il est descendant de Cham, selon l'ethnologie Biblique, comment la race noire pourrait-elle être plus ancienne que celle de Sem ou de Japhet? N'est-ce pas la race la plus intellectuelle, la plus prospère, la plus endurante dont parle l'histoire, celle des Juifs, qui s'est le mieux préservée contre un mélange du sang?

RÉPONSE - Nulle part, la Bible n'affirme que les Noirs sont les descendants de Cham; en outre, c'est une chose reconnue que l'ethnologie Biblique, telle que l'admet la thèse traditionnelle, est une impossibilité complète à la lumière des faits géologiques et des recherches ethnologiques. Le temps est fini où l'on avait le front de déclarer ainsi que le fit, il y a moins d'un siècle, un savant de l'Université de Cambridge, que le monde fut créé un vendredi 10 octobre 4004 avant Jésus-Christ, à neuf heures du matin. L'ethnologie Biblique fixe aussi exactement l'heure du Déluge et d'autres évènements de similaire importance, mais du point de vue occulte, c'est-à-dire si l'on se base directement sur l'examen de la grande fresque du Passé, à laquelle nous donnons le nom de mémoire de la nature, ce que nous voyons est bien différent. Là, nous apprenons qu'il y a eu, dans l'histoire de la Terre, différentes époques ou grandes phases d'évolution, et que les Noirs étaient l'humanité de la troisième de ces époques, l'Epoque Lémurienne. A ce moment-là, la race humaine tout entière avait la peau noire. Puis vint l'Epoque appelée Atlantéenne, où l'humanité avait la peau rouge,jaune, sauf une race qui avait la peau blanche. Cette race-là était celle des Sémites Originaux, cinquième race Atlantéenne. Dans l'ancien folklore nordique, ces Atlantéens sont appelés Niebelungen, ou enfants du brouillard, car en ce temps-là, l'atmosphère de la terre était faite de brouillard très dense. Dans la dernière moitié de l'Epoque Atlantéenne, l'atmosphère s'est condensée, ce qui amena des inondations et graduellement la mer a couvert la plus grande partie du globe. Peu à peu, au-dessus de la Terre, l'atmosphère s'est éclaircie. Ce point de l'évolution est décrit dans la Bible, dans le passage où Noé, le chef des Sémites, échappa de l'Atlantide engloutie, et aperçut pour la première fois l'arc-en-ciel (Genèse 9/12-17), phénomène impossible dans l'atmosphère brumeuse de l'Atlantide. Nous connaissons aussi cette émigration par le récit dans lequel Moïse et les enfants d'Israël sont sortis d'Egypte, alors que le Pharaon et son armée se noyaient dans les eaux de la Mer Rouge. Les Sémites Originaux avaient été choisis pour constituer la souche des races Aryennes, mais certains ne furent pas fidèles aux ordres de leur chef. Il y en eut qui se marièrent dans des familles étrangères, ce qui, à cette époque, était un crime abominable, car lorsqu'un chef de race se propose d'instiller de nouvelles facultés à une race nouvelle, le mélange du sang étranger tend à déjouer ses plans. C'est pourquoi il y en eut, parmi le peuple choisi, qui furent perdus, c'est-à-dire abandonnés par leurs guides, et ne sont pas devenus les ancêtres de la nouvelle race humaine.

Ceux qui furent ainsi perdus ou laissés en arrière sont, c'est étrange à dire, les Juifs actuels qui, à une certaine époque, s'étaient mariés dans les familles de leurs frères Atlantéens, contrairement aux ordres de leur chef divin, et pourtant aujourd'hui encore, ils se considèrent comme le "peuple élu" de Dieu. Il n'y a aucun doute que les anciens Juifs se souviennent du péché de se marier en dehors de leurs tribus. De ce fait, ils ont inculqué à leurs descendants une forte aversion pour les unions avec d'autres tribus, et ces rebelles d'antan sont dès lors restés fidèles à l'injonction de ne pas se marier parmi les Gentils.

Quant à les considérer comme une race intellectuelle, nous disons non!. Au cours de l'Epoque Polaire, l'homme a développé un corps dense et le principe vitalisant au cours de l'Epoque Hyperboréenne. Au cours de l'Epoque Lémurienne, le corps du désir a fourni un aiguillon à l'action, et l'intellect fut ajouté durant l'Epoque Atlantéenne, donnant à l'homme la ruse. La pensée, ou raison, est la faculté qui doit être développée pendant cette Epoque Aryenne. Or, un examen des faits nous indique que les Juifs sont encore puissamment inspirés par la faculté Atlantéenne de ruse.

Les guides de l'humanité se sont efforcés d'amener ce peuple à se mélanger avec les autres races, afin qu'ils puissent sortir de leur condition actuelle. La Bible nous apprend qu'ils ont été exilés maintes et maintes fois, mais sans résultat; ils sont restés un peuple à part. Le Christ leur fut envoyé comme un des leurs, car on pensait qu'ils entendraient la parole de l'un des leurs, mais "ils choisirent Barabbas". C'en était trop; il s'était avéré qu'on ne pourrait jamais les sauver en bloc. Dès lors, ils furent éparpillés de par le monde, afin que, peuple apatride, ils finissent par fusionner avec les autres; mais telle est leur obstination qu'ils sont demeurés, jusqu'à ce jour, sur leurs positions, sauf, pourtant, aux Etats- Unis, "le grand creuset des races", où ils commencent lentement à s'amalgamer. Ils ont été perdus pour s'être alliés en dehors de leur tribu à une race inférieure. Mais, avec le temps, il seront sauvés en s'alliant, sur le continent américain, aux races les plus avancées.

### <h3 id="question-27">Question 27</h3>

La Philosophie Rosicrucienne a-t-elle un enseignement spécifique concernant l'éducation des enfants?

RÉPONSE - Il n'y a peut-être pas de sujet plus important que celui-là. En premier lieu, les parents avisés, désireux de donner à l'enfant tous les avantages possibles, commencent, avant la naissance, avant même la conception, à tourner leurs pensées, par la prière, sur la tâche qu'ils vont entreprendre. Ils ont soin de veiller à ce que l'union qui doit aboutir à la conception ait lieu sous des influences stellaires propices, quand la Lune passe à travers des signes qui favorisent la construction d'un corps sain et vigoureux, leurs propres corps se trouvant dans les meilleures conditions physiques, mentales et morales possibles.

Puis, durant la période de gestation, ils entretiennent constamment devant leur esprit l'image idéale d'une vie énergique et utile pour l'entité qui va venir. Et, dès que possible après la naissance, ils établissent l'horoscope de l'enfant, car les parents idéals sont aussi astrologues. Cependant. s'ils ne savent pas eux-mêmes calculer le thème, ils pourront du moins étudier les signes stellaires, ce qui leur permettra de comprendre les explications de l'astrologue; mais en aucun cas, ils ne consulteront un astrologue de profession qui avilit son savoir en le vendant à prix d'or; ils chercheront l'aide d'un astrologue spirituel, même si cela leur prend du temps pour le trouver. Le thème astrologique révélera les points forts et les points faibles du caractère de l'enfant. Les parents seront ainsi en excellente position pour encourager ce qui est bien, et réprimer ce qui est mal avant que les tendances se transforment en choses réelles; de la sorte les parents peuvent dans une large mesure aider l'entité qui va renaître à surmonter ses défauts.

Ensuite, les parents doivent se rappeler que ce que nous appelons naissance n'est que la naissance du corps physique, visible, qui est né et parvient à sont présent degré élevé d'efficacité en un temps plus court que les véhicules invisibles de l'homme, car c'est lui qui a eu la plus longue évolution. De même que le fotus est protégé des impacts du monde extérieur, étant dans le sein de la mère durant la période de gestation, ainsi les véhicules subtils de l'enfant sont-ils aussi dans des enveloppes faites d'éther et de substance- désir qui les protègent jusqu'à ce qu'ils aient atteint une maturité suffisante, et soient capables de supporter les conditions du monde extérieur.

Ainsi le corps vital naît à l'âge de sept ans environ, ou lorsque l'enfant a sa seconde dentition, et le corps du désir naît à quatorze ans environ, ou à l'époque de la puberté. L'intellect naît autour de vingt-et-un ans, lorsque nous disons qu'un homme a atteint sa majorité.

Il est certaines choses importantes dont les parents ne peuvent s'occuper utilement que pendant la période de croissance de l'enfant, et qu'ils ne doivent pas négliger. Bien que les organes soient déjà formés au moment de la naissance, les lignes de croissance sont déterminées durant les sept premières années, et si elles ne sont pas correctement marquées durant cette période, un enfant qui autrement aurait pu être en santé, peut devenir un adulte maladif.

Au premier chapitre de Saint Jean, nous lisons "Au commencement était le Verbe ... et rien de ce qui a été fait n'a été fait sans lui ... et le Verbe s'est fait chair." Le Verbe est un son rythmique, et le son est le grand constructeur cosmique, c'est pourquoi durant le premier septénaire de sa vie, l'enfant doit être entouré de musique du genre qui convient, entouré d'un langage musical: la cadence et le rythme des chansons enfantines sont particulièrement précieux. Le sens des paroles est sans importance; seul le rythme importe; plus l'enfant en sera baigné, meilleure sera sa croissance et sa santé.

Deux grands mot d'ordre s'appliquent à cette période de la vie de l'enfant. Ce sont imitation et exemple. There is no creature in the world so imitative as a little child; it follows our example to the smallest detail so far as it is able. Therefore, the parents who seek to bring up their child well will ever be careful when in the presence of the little one. It is no use to teach it not to mind; the child has no mind, it has no reason, it can only imitate, and it cannot help imitating any more than water can help running down hill. If we have one kind of food for ourselves which is highly seasoned and cooked in French style, perhaps, and we give our child another dish, telling it that what we eat is not good for it, the child may not then be able to imitate us, but we implant the appetite for such food in the little one. When it grows up and can gratify its taste it will do so. Therefore, the careful parents should abstain from the foods and liquors they do not wish their child to partake of. 

Regarding the clothing, we may say that at that time the child should be entirely unconscious of its sex organs, and therefore the clothing should be particularly loose at all times. This is specially necessary with little boys, for oftentimes a most seriously bad habit in later life may result from the rubbing of too tight clothing. 

There is also the question of punishment to be considered; that too is an important factor at all times in awakening the sex nature and should be carefully avoided. There is no child so refractory that it will not respond to the method of reward for good deeds and the withholding of privileges as retribution for disobedience. Besides, we recognize the fact that whipping breaks the spirit of a dog, and we oftentimes complain that certain people have cultivated a wishbone instead of a backbone--that they are lacking in will. Much of that is due to whippings, mercilessly administered in childhood. Let any parent look at this from the child's standpoint. How would any of us now like to live with someone from whose authority we could not escape, who was much bigger than we, and have to submit to whippings day by day? Leave the whipping alone and much of the social evil will be done away with in a generation. 

When the vital body has been brought to birth at the seventh year, the faculties of perception and memory are to be educated. The watchword for this period should be authority and discipleship. We should not, if we have a precocious child, seek to goad it into a course of study which requires an enormous expenditure of thought. Child prodigies have usually become men and women of less than ordinary mentality. The child should be allowed to follow his own inclination in that respect. His faculties of observation should be cultivated, he should be shown living examples. Let him see the drunkard and what vice has led him to; show him also the good man, and set before him high ideals. Teach him to take everything you say upon authority and endeavor to be such that he may respect your authority as parents and teachers. At this time he should also be prepared to husband the force which is now being awakened in him, and which will enable him to generate his kind at the end of the second period of seven years. He should not be allowed to gather that knowledge from polluted sources, because the parents shirk the responsibility of telling him from a mistaken sense of modesty. 

A flower may be taken as an object lesson, whence all the children, from the smallest to the biggest, may receive the most beautiful instruction in the form of a fairy tale. They may be taught how flowers are like families without bothering at all with botanical terms, so long as the parents have studied in the slightest degree a little elementary botany. Show the children some flowers. Tell them "Here is a flower family where there are all boys (a staminate flower), and here is another flower where there are only girls (a pistillate flower). Here is one where there are both boys and girls (a flower where there are both stamen and pistils). Show them the pollen in the anthers. Tell them that these little flower boys are just like the boys in the human families; that they are adventuresome and want to go out into the world to fight the battle of life, while the girls (the pistils) stay at home. Show them the bees with the pollen baskets on their legs, and tell them how the little flower boys bestride those winged steeds, like the knights of old, and go out into the world to seek the princess immured in the magic castle (the ovule hidden in the pistil); how the pollen, the flower boy-knights, force their way through the pistil and enter the ovule; then tell them how that signifies that the knight and the princess are married, that they live happy ever afterward and become the parents of many little flower boys and girls. When they have fully grasped that, they will understand also the generation in the animal and human kingdom, for there is no difference; one is just as pure and chaste and holy as the other. And the little children brought up in that way will always have a reverence for the creative function that can be instilled in no better way. 

When a child has been thus equipped, it is well fortified for the birth of the desire body at the time of puberty. When the desires and the emotions are unleashed, it enters upon the most dangerous period of life, the time of the hot youth from fourteen to twenty-one, for at that time the desire body is rampant and the mind has not yet come to birth to act as a brake. At this time it is well for the child that has been brought up as here outlined, for its parents will then be a strength and an anchor to it to tide it over that troublesome period until the time when it is full born--the age of twenty-one , when the mind is born. 

### <h3 id="question-28">Question 28</h3>

Pourquoi des enfants naissent-ils dans une famille où ils ne sont pas désirés?

RÉPONSE - La pertinence de cette question est la preuve du triste état de notre société. Le but essentiel du mariage est la perpétuation de la race, et ceux qui ne désirent pas devenir parents n'ont pas droit au mariage. Ce devrait être le droit de chaque enfant de bien naître et d'être bienvenu. Mais, tandis que nous choisissons, pour l'élevage des animaux, la lignée la plus pure afin d'obtenir le bétail le meilleur et le plus robuste, nous ne nous préoccupons généralement pas des qualités physiques, morales et mentales de la personne que nous choisissons comme père ou comme mère de nos enfants. En fait, on estime que c'est indélicat, indécent même de soulever la question des enfants, et lorsque, en dépit des précautions, l'enfant est annoncé, les parents sont souvent navrés. Mais la loi de cause à effet ne peut être déjouée. Les meules des dieux broient lentement, mais leur mouture est excessivement fine. Bien des siècles pourront s'écouler, mais viendra le temps où le père et la mère qui avaient refusé leur enfant devront renaître dans une famille où ils ne seront pas bienvenus. Il se peut aussi que des enfants soient refusés à ces parents dans leur incarnation suivante. L'auteur connaît des cas où de tels couples, ayant eu le bonheur d'avoir de nombreux enfants qu'ils avaient désirés et qu'ils aimaient passionnément les ont vu mourir en bas âge, les uns après les autres, à leur grand désespoir.

### <h3 id="question-29">Question 29</h3>

Lorsqu'un homme et une femme désirent avoir des enfants et qu'ils n'en ont pas, y a-t-il moyen d'engager une âme du monde invisible à accepter l'invitation à renaître? Lorsque les conditions sont des plus favorables dans leur foyer, il semble que parmi les nombreuses âmes qui attendent l'occasion de renaître, il devrait s'en trouver une pour accepter ces conditions.

RÉPONSE - Le cas est très certainement celui d'un de ces couples qui, dans une vie antérieure, a négligé cette occasion ou évité d'avoir des enfants. S'il n'en est pas ainsi, il se peut que, quelque jour, leur espoir soit comblé. L'auteur a observé le cas d'un Ego qui, désireux de renaître, suivait partout celle qu'il avait choisie pour être sa mère, et quelqu'un qui connaissait cette femme depuis longtemps, lui a raconté que cet Ego la suivait depuis avant son mariage. Il advint pourtant que l'union fut stérile et nous avons appris récemment qu'un divorce avait eu lieu. Il est clair que cet Ego qui, de toute évidence, voulait renaître avec cette femme pour mère, n'acceptait pas son mari comme père. On entend parfois parler de ménages stériles, mais que le divorce soit prononcé et que chacun des conjoints se remarie, il peut très bien se faire que tous deux aient des enfants, ce qui prouve qu'ils étaient parfaitement aptes à procréer, physiquement parlant, et que seul, l'Ego, manquait. Car, il faut bien le remarquer, à moins qu'un Ego ne cherche à renaître dans un couple, celui-ci demeurera stérile. 

Bien que cela puisse sembler étrange au premier abord, on sera convaincu de la véracité du fait si l'on réfléchit à ceci: les constituants chimiques du liquide séminal et des ovules sont toujours les mêmes; il n'y aurait donc aucune raison pour qu'une union soit tantôt féconde, tantôt stérile, si les parents étaient les seuls facteurs à considérer. Nous savons que si nous combinons de l'hydrogène avec de l'oxigène dans des proportions adéquates, nous obtenons toujours de l'eau. Nous savons que l'eau coule le long d'une pente. C'est ainsi que les lois de la nature sont invariables; donc, à moins qu'un autre facteur n'entre en jeu, la combinaison chimique de l'ovule et du spermatozoïde devrait donner inévitablement un résultat positif. Or, cet autre facteur inconnu et invisible existe: c'est l'Ego prêt à renaître qui va où il lui plaît d'aller et, sans lui, il n'y a pas de conception.

Si le demandeur adresse des prières ferventes à l'Ange Gabriel (Luc 1/19 et 26), ambassadeur du Régent de la Lune sur notre Terre, et qui est donc un facteur essentiel dans la génération des corps, il se peut que sa prière soit exaucée. Le moment le plus propice est le Lundi au lever du Soleil, entre la nouvelle et la pleine Lune.

### <h3 id="question-30">Question 30</h3>

Comment expliquez-vous le fait qu'un enfant hérite si souvent des mauvais côtés de ses parents?

RÉPONSE - Nous expliquerons cela en disant que ce n'est pas du tout certain. Malheureusement, les gens sont fort enclins à mettre leurs imperfections sur le compte de l'hérédité et à rendre ainsi leurs parents responsables de leurs défauts, alors qu'ils s'accordent à eux-mêmes tout le crédit de leurs bonnes qualités. Le fait même que nous établissions une différence entre ce que nous devons à l'hérédité, et ce qui nous appartient en propre, prouve qu'il y a deux côtés dans la nature humaine: le côté forme et le côté vie.

L'homme, le penseur, vient sur terre avec une nature morale et mentale qui lui appartient en propre. Il n'a pris à ses parents que les matériaux nécessaires à la construction de son corps physique. Nous sommes attirés vers certaines personnes par la loi de cause à effet et par la loi d'association. La même loi qui fait que les musiciens, par exemple, recherchent la compagnie d'autres musiciens dans les salles de concert, ou que les joueurs se rassemblent sur les champs de course ou dans les salles de jeu, que les gens de nature studieuse s'assemblent dans les bibliothèques, etc., fait que des personnes de tendances, de caractéristiques et de goûts semblables naîtront dans la même famille. C'est ainsi que lorsque nous entendons une personne déclarer: "Oui,je sais parfaitement que je suis prodigue, mais mes parents ne travaillaient pas. Nous avons toujours eu des domestiques", il ne faut voir là qu'une simple similitude de goûts entre eux et elle. Si quelqu'un d'autre vous dit: "Je me rends compte que je suis un peu fantasque; je tiens ça de famille; je n'y puis rien", il s'agit à nouveau de la loi d'association, et plus tôt nous le reconnaissons au lieu de prendre la loi d'hérédité pour excuser nos mauvaises habitudes, mieux cela vaudra pour nous, et nous ferions bien de nous en corriger et de cultiver les vertus opposées. Nous n'accepterions pas comme une excuse valable la déclaration de l'ivrogne qui dirait: "Je ne peux m'empêcher de boire. Tous mes camarades en font autant". Nous lui dirions de s'éloigner d'eux au plus tôt et d'affirmer sa propre individualité. Cessons donc de nous retrancher derrière nos ancêtres pour nous excuser de nos mauvaises habitudes.

### <h3 id="question-31">Question 31</h3>

L'enfant n'hérite-t-il pas son sang et son système nerveux de ses parents ? en ce cas n'hérite-t-il pas également leurs maladies et leurs désordres nerveux?

RÉPONSE - Dans le foetus, à la partie inférieure de la gorge, juste au-dessus du sternum, se trouve le thymus, glande qui est la plus volumineuse pendant la période de gestation et qui s'atrophie graduellement à mesure que l'enfant grandit, pour disparaître entièrement à ou vers la quatorzième année, le plus souvent quand les os sont complètement formés. La science a été embarrassée pour expliquer l'usage de cette glande, et quelques théories ont été émises, et l'une d'entre elles est que le thymus fournit la substance nécessaire à la formation des globules rouges du sang jusqu'à ce que les os soient complètement formés et que l'enfant puisse produire lui-même ses propres globules. Cette théorie est correcte.

Pendant la première enfance, l'Ego qui est propriétaire du corps de l'enfant n'en a pas la pleine possession, et nous reconnaissons que l'enfant n'est pas responsable de ses actes, du moins jusqu'à l'âge de sept ans, période que nous avons ensuite étendue jusqu'à quatorze ans. Durant cette période, aucune obligation légale n'est attachée à l'enfant pour ses actes, et il est juste qu'il en soit ainsi, car l'Ego, résidant dans le sang, peut seulement fonctionner correctement dans le sang qu'il a produit lui-même. Et comme, pendant l'enfance, le stock de sang est fourni par les parents par l'intermédiaire du thymus, l'enfant n'est pas encore son propre maître. C'est pourquoi les tout-petits ne parlent pas d'eux en disant "Je", au cours des premières années, mais s'identifient avec la famille; ils sont "la fille de papa, le garçon de maman", ou disent "Marie veut cela" ou "Jean veut ceal". Mais dès qu'ils approchent de la puberté et qu'ils commencent à produire leurs propres globules sanguins ,le garçon ou la fille disent "Je" ferai ceci, ou "Je" vais à tel endroit. Dès lors ils commencent à affirmer leur identité, et à se détacher de la famille.

Donc, puisque l'enfant hérite de ses parents son corps et son sang, il hérite aussi de leurs tendances à la maladie; non de la maladie elle-même, mais uniquement de la tendance. Après la quatorzième année, lorsque l'Ego intérieur a commencé à produire ses propres globules de sang rouge, il dépend de lui dans une large mesure que ces tendances deviennent des réalités dans sa vie. 

### <h3 id="question-32">Question 32</h3>

Une personne peut-elle être influencée dans son sommeil naturel comme elle peut l'être dans le sommeil hypnotique, ou bien y a-t-il une différence?

RÉPONSE - Oui, il y a une différence. Dans le sommeil naturel, l'Ego, revêtu de l'intellect et du corps du désir, se retire du corps physique au-dessus duquel il plane habituellement ou, en tout cas, il reste à proximité, relié à lui par la corde d'argent. Le corps dense et le corps éthérique reposent sur le lit.

Il est alors possible d'exercer une influence sur la personne endormie en instillant dans son cerveau les pensées et les idées que nous désirons lui communiquer. Néanmoins nous ne pouvons, ni lui faire faire, ni même lui faire penser quelque chose qui ne soit pas en accord avec ses tendances naturelles. Il est impossible de lui ordonner d'accomplir une action et de la contraindre à obéir, comme il est possible de le faire quand l'Ego a été chassé de son corps par les passes d'un hypnotiseur, car c'est le cerveau qui fait mouvoir les muscles et, durant le sommeil naturel, le cerveau est interpénétré par son propre corps vital et il est parfaitement maître de lui, alors que durant le sommeil hypnotique, les passes de l'hypnotiseur ont chassé hors du cerveau l'éther dont son corps vital est composé et cet éther repose sur ses épaules à la façon d'un col de chandail qui lui retomberait autour du cou. Le cerveau physique est alors ouvert à l'éther du corps vital de l'hypnotiseur qui prend la place de l'éther du véritable possesseur. Ainsi, dans le sommeil hypnotique, la victime n'a en aucune façon le choix de ses idées ni des mouvements qu'il fait avec son corps. Mais dans le sommeil ordinaire, la personne conserve son libre arbitre. En fait, les mères qui ont des enfants indociles trouveront très bénéfique cette méthode de suggestion pendant le sommeil. Assise près du lit de l'enfant endormi, sa mère, en lui tenant la main, lui parle comme elle le ferait s'il était éveillé, et instille dans son cerveau les idées qu'elle aimerait lui voir entretenir. Au réveil de l'enfant, elle découvrira que les idées implantées ont pris racine. Il en est de même d'une personne malade ou qui s'adonne à la boisson ou à tout autre vice. Si la mère, la garde-malade ou quelqu'un d'autre emploie cette méthode, ces personnes constateront qu'il est possible d'instiller espoir, guérison, rétablissement et aide pour la maîtrise de soi. Cette même méthode peut bien entendu, être utilisée pour le mal; mais nous ne pouvons nous empêcher de la faire connaître, car nous croyons que le bien qui peut en résulter compensera largement le mal que pourraient faire certaines personnes mal intentionnées qui l'emploieraient à mauvais escient.

### <h3 id="question-33">Question 33</h3>

Que sont les rêves? Ont-ils une signification? Comment pouvons- nous les attirer ou les faire naître?

RÉPONSE - A l'état de veille, les divers véhicules de l'Ego,l'intellect, le corps du désir, le corps vital et le corps physique, sont tous concentriques. Ils occupent le même espace, et l'Ego fonctionne dans leMonde Physique. La nuit, pendant le sommeil sans rêves, l'Ego, revêtu de l'intellect et du corps du désir se retire, laissant le corps physique et le corps vital sur le lit, et il n'y a plus de connexion entre les véhicules supérieurs et les véhicules inférieurs, sauf un fil luisant et fin, appelé la corde d'argent. Il arrive parfois que l'Ego se soit tellement intéressé au travail dans le Monde Physique et que le corps du désir soit si agité qu'il refuse de quitter les véhicules inférieurs et ne s'en retire qu'à demi. Alors la connexion entre les centres de perception du corps du désir et les centres sensoriels du cerveau physique n'est que partiellement rompue. L'Ego voit se déroulerles vues et les scènes du Monde du Désir qui, en elles-mêmes, sont fantastiques et illusoires à l'extrême, et elles sont transmises aux centres sensoriels du cerveau auxquels manque le lien de la raison. Cette condition explique les rêves insensés et bizarres que nous avons.

Il arrive aussi parfois que, lorsque l'Ego est complètement dégagé du corps physique, comme dans le sommeil sans rêves, il voie un événement qui le concerne et qui est sur le point de se matérialiser, car les événements à venir "projettent leur ombre devant eux" et avant que les choses se produisent dans le monde matériel ils se sont déjà produits dans les mondes spirituels. Si, s'éveillant après une telle expérience, l'Ego réussit à imprimer sur son cerveau ce qu'il a vu, nous avons alors un rêve prophétique qui, en temps voulu, se réalisera, ou que l'Ego, si sa destinée le permet, pourra modifier par une nouvelle action. Par exemple, s'il est averti d'un accident, il pourra prendre les mesures nécessaires pour l'éviter.

En ce qui concerne la seconde partie de la question, "comment faire naître ou attirer des rêves", nous pouvons dire qu'il n'y a évidemment aucun avantage à attirer ou à faire naître des rêves de nature confuse et fantastique. Quant aux autres rêves, il vient un temps où l'homme commence à vivre la vie supérieure. Alors, graduellement, en accomplissant certains exercices, il développe la faculté de quitter son corps consciemment la nuit, ou à tout autre moment. Il est alors parfaitement conscient dans les mondes invisibles. Il peut aller où il veut, jusqu'aux confins de la terre en quelques minutes, et comme il apprend à travailler consciemment dans les mondes invisibles, il ne "rêve" plus, mais vit une autre vie plus remplie ou plus réelle que celle qu'il vit actuellement.

### <h3 id="question-34">Question 34</h3>

Qu'est-ce que le sommeil et pourquoi se fait-il que le corps s'endort?

RÉPONSE - Pendant la journée, le corps vital spécialise le fluide solaire incolore qui se trouve partout autour de nous, au moyen de l'organe que nous appelons la rate. Cette force vitale interpénètre le corps physique tout entier, et le clairvoyant la voit comme un fluide de couleur rose pâle, car elle a été transformée en entrant dans le corps physique. Elle coule le long des nerfs, et lorsqu'elle est envoyée par les centres du cerveau en quantités particulièrement importantes, elle fait mouvoir les muscles auxquels conduisent les nerfs.

On peut dire du corps vital qu'il est formé de pointes faisant saillie dans toutes les directions, intérieurement, extérieurement, en haut, en bas, par tout le corps, et que chaque petite pointe traverse le centre d'un atome chimique, faisant vibrer celui-ci à un taux plus élevé qu'il ne le fait naturellement. Le corps vital interpénètre le corps physique dela naissance à la mort, qu'elles que soient les conditions, sauf lorsque la circulation du sang est arrêtée dans une certaine partie du corps, par exemple lorsque nous laissons pendre notre main au bord d'une table et qu'elle s'engourdit. Si nous sommes clairvoyant, nous verrons alors pendre la main du corps vital au- dessous de la main physique, comme pendrait un gant, et les atomes chimiques de cette main sont retombés à leur lent taux naturel de vibration. Lorsque nous frappons la main pour la ranimer, le fourmillement que nous éprouvons est causé par les pointes du corps vital qui rentrent dans les atomes endormis de la main et accélèrent de nouveau leur vibration.

Le corps vital quitte le corps dense de la même manière lorsqu'une personne est en train de mourir. Les noyés que l'on a rappelé à la vie souffrent intensément des piqûres occasionnées par les pointes du corps vital reprenant leur place.

Pendant la journée, lorsque le fluide solaire est absorbé par l'homme en grandes quantités, les pointes du corps vital sont gonflées ou dilatées, pour ainsi dire, par ce fluide vital, mais à mesure que le jour avance et que les substances toxiques obstruent de plus en plus le corps physique, le fluide vital circule moins rapidement; le soir, il arrive un moment où les pointes du corps vital ne reçoivent plus assez abondamment le fluide donnant la vie; elles se recroquevillent et les atomes du corps physique vibrent plus laborieusement. L'Ego se rend compte que le corps est lourd, sans entrain et fatigué. Enfin arrive le moment où le corps vital s'affaisse, pour ainsi dire, et où les vibrations des atomes du corps physique deviennent si lentes que l'Ego ne peut plus mouvoir celui-ci. Il est obligé de se retirer afin que ce véhicule puisse être restauré. Nous disons alors que le corps est endormi.

Le sommeil n'est cependant pas un temps d'inactivité; s'il en était ainsi, on ne se sentirait pas reposé en s'éveillant le matin, et le sommeil n'aurait aucune action restauratrice. Ce seul mot de restauration implique une idée d'activité.

Lorsqu'une construction s'est délabrée à l'usage, il est nécessaire de la rénover et de la restaurer, et les occupants doivent en sortir pour permettre aux ouvriers de travailler. C'est pour la même raison que l'Ego quitte sa demeure pendant la nuit. De même que les ouvriers travaillent à restaurer le logis pour le rendre de nouveau habitable, l'Ego doit réparer son habitation avant de pouvoir y rentrer. Nous accomplissons ce travail la nuit, bien que nous n'en soyons pas conscients à l'état de veille. C'est grâce à cette activité que l'organisme se débarrasse des toxines, et le matin, quand l'Ego rentre dans son corps à l'heure du réveil, il le trouve dispos et plein de vigueur. 

### <h3 id="question-35">Question 35</h3>

Les Rosicruciens croient-ils à la médecine officielle, ou suivent-ils la méthode de guérison du Christ?

RÉPONSE - Les meilleurs praticiens reconnaissent généralement que la médecine est une science empirique; que les remèdes n'agissent pas de la même manière sur toutes les personnes et qu'il est par conséquent nécessaire que le médecin fasse des expériences sur ses patients. La médecine n'est donc pas satisfaisante.On ne peut pas compter en toute occasion sur l'efficacité des remèdes.

L'observation nous montre que si tous les boeufs se nourrissent d'herbe et que tous les lions se trouvent fort bien d'une nourriture carnée, il y a chez l'être humain une individualité qui rend chacun différent du reste de son espèce; et cette particularité de la race humaine vient du fait que chaque espèce animale est l'expression d'un seul esprit-groupe qui guide chaque animal de l'extérieur alors qu'en chaque être huamin il y a un Esprit intérieur, un Ego, et c'est pourquoi la nourriture d'une personne est souvent un poison pour une autre.

Ce seulement lorsque la médecine tient compte de ce point qu'elle peut être réellement utile dans tous les cas, et le moyen de découvrir les particularités de l'Esprit qui habite dans le corps du malade est d'établir son horoscope afin de savoir quels sont les moments propices pour administrer les remèdes, pour donner les plantes appropriées. C'est ce que faisait Paracelse, et c'est pourquoi il avait toujours du succès avec ses malades; il ne faisait jamais d'erreur. Il en est qui emploient l'astrologie dans le même but de nos jours; l'auteur par exemple s'en est lui-même servi pour établir des diagnostics dans de nombreux cas. Il a ainsi toujours été en mesure de voir les crises dans l'état du malade, qu'il s'agisse du passé, du présent ou de l'avenir; cela lui a permis d'apporter un grand soulagement à des personnes souffrant de maladies diverses. C'est pour de tels usages que l'astrologie doit être utilisée, et non pour prédire l'avenir contre paiement car, comme toutes les sciences spirituelles, elle doit être utilisée pour le bien de l'humanité, indépendamment de toute considération financière. Si les médecins voulaient bien étudier la science de l'astrologie, ils seraient capables, grâce à un petit effort, d'établir le diagnostic de l'état de santé de leurs malades d'une manière impossible à obtenir selon le point de vue habituel du diagnosticien. Certains médecins commencent à se rendre compte de ce fait et ont découvert à la lumière de leurs expériences que les corps célestes ont une influence sur l'être humain. Par exemple, lorsque l'auteur était à Portland (Oregon) un médecin lui avait confié que chaque fois qu'il lui était possible de faire une opération lorsque la Lune était croissante, c'est-à-dire de la nouvelle Lune à la pleine Lune, l'opération réussissait toujours et n'amenait aucune complication. Par contre, il avait remarqué que lorsqu'il était contraint par les circonstances d'opérer alors que la Lune était décroissante, il devait s'attendre à des complications, et que ces opérations ne donnaient jamais un résultat aussi satisfaisant que lorsque la lumière de la Lune était croissante.

Une tendance existe aussi chez les médecins, et c'est de guérir de plus en plus par la suggestion, donnant au malade une pilule inoffensive et une bonne suggestion. Chaque mère, qu'elle ait ou non connaissane de la puissance de la suggestion, l'emploie inconsciemment quand il s'agit de son enfant. Si le petit tombe, elle peut, par sa suggestion, le faire rire ou pleurer. Si elle dit "Oh! mon pauvre petit! Comme tu as fait mal à ta pauvre petite tête!", l'enfant va se mettre à pleurer; mais si, au contraire, elle lui montre le meuble auquel il s'est heurté en lui disant "Oh! mon chéri, comme tu as fait mal à ce pauvre meuble! Embrasse-le vite!", l'enfant sera désolé pour le meuble et ne pensera pas du tout à son mal.

Le médecin a sur ses malades une influence analogue, et il est criminel de sa part d'entrer chez l'un d'eux, l'air sombre, en lui demandant de faire son testament, n'en ayant plus pour longtemps à vivre. Ces choses agissent sur le malade avec plus de force qu'on ne saurait l'imaginer, et plus d'un médecin a ainsi causé la mort de celui qu'il avait des chances de sauver. Si, au contraire, il se montre encourageant, s'il entre dans la chambre de son malade, le sourire aux lèvres, lui donne un remède sans danger accompagné d'une bonne suggestion, le malade est aidé à se rétablir alors qu'il aurait pu succomber. Ainsi, la suggestion surpasse de beaucoup la médecine. La confiance du malade en son médecin accomplit des prodiges, en bien comme en mal, et la foi était la méthode que le Christ utilisait dans Ses guérisons. Si l'auteur de la question veut bien rechercher dans la Bible les passages où le Christ guérit les malades, il remarquera qu'il y a toujours une question concernant lafoi de celui qui cherche la guérison. A chacun, le Christ disait "Qu'il te soit fait selon ta foi".

Ce scepticisme qui détruisait même Son pouvoir est, peut-être, le plus évident dans le passage où il est précisé qu'Il séjourna dans sa ville natale et constata qu' "Un prophète n'est méprisé que dans sa patrie et dans sa maison". Ceci figure au chapitre 13, versets 57 de l'Evangile de Matthieu, également au chapitre 6 verset 4 de l'Evangile de Marc; et il est significatif que le verset suivant, dans l'Evangile de Matthieu, précise "Et il ne fit pas là beaucoup de miracles à cause de leur incrédulité.", alors qu'au verset 5 de son Evangile, même chapitre, Marc nous dit, à cause de leur scepticisme, "Et il ne fut fait aucun miracle en ce lieu, si ce n'est qu'Il guérit quelques malades en leur imposant les mains.". Autres références: Luc 4/24 et Jean 4/44.

Un esprit ouvert est une exigence essentielle pour n'importe quelle investigation et le scepticisme est absolument fatal à l'acquisition de la connaissance. Nous mentionnerons, en guise d'exemple, le fait suivant: il y a quelques années, l'auteur assistait, à Colombus (Ohio), à une conférence du professeur Hyslop, secrétaire de la Société des recherches psychiques. Le sujet de la conférence était "Preuves nouvelles d'une vie future". Il fut étonné de constater que le conférencier n'apportait aucune preuve qui n'eût déjà été exposée dans les rapports des vingt dernières années de la société à laquelle il appartenait. Le problème fut résolu au moment où une question, posée à l'issue de la conférence, mit en évidence le fait que le professeur Hyslop n'accordait pas foi à ce qui avait été dit dans les rapports de la Société. Il ne croyait qu'aux résultats qu'il obtenait lui-même. Les preuves qu'il venait d'exposer avaient été réunies par lui; elles étaient donc nouvelles pour lui et il s'attendait à ce que son auditoire le crût sur parole, bien qu'il refusât lui-même de croire qui que ce fût. Ce même professeur Hyslop fournit, sans le vouloir, un très bon exemple de la manière dont agit le scepticisme lorsqu'il raconta l'histoire suivante: Comme il s'était un jour rendu chez un médium, feu Richard Hodgson avait parlé par cet intermédiaire. Le professeur lui avait posé des questions très simples auxquelles M. Hodgson n'avait répondu qu'avec la plus grande difficulté. Le professeur, impatienté, s'était enfin écrié. "Qu'est-ce que tu as donc, Richard? De ton vivant, tu avais pourtant l'esprit assez vif!" La réponse arriva du tac au tac "Oh! chaque fois que je me trouve dans votre détestable ambiance, je perds tous mes moyens." Le professeur s'était étonné de cette réponse et n'en avait pas compris la raison, mais quiconque a vu un élève devant une commission d'examinateurs persuadés qu'il est un cancre, saura à quoi s'en tenir. La disposition d'esprit critique et de scepticisme du professeur Hyslop empêchait Hodgson de communiquer facilement avec lui. Nous pouvons donc affirmer que nous croyons à la médecine, lorsqu'elle est utilisée conjointement à l'astrologie, et aussi à la méthode de guérison (healing) du Christ, qui est la Guérison par la Foi (Faith Cure); nous croyons également au pouvoir de la suggestion et aux divers autres procédés de guérison. Tous contiennent une partie de vérité, bien que beaucoup tournent malheureusement au snobisme et à l'exagération. Ils perdent alors leur pouvoir pour le bien et deviennent une menace pour ceux qui, autrement, en auraient bénéficié.

### <h3 id="question-36">Question 36</h3>

Puisque la souffrance est le résultat de nos propres actions, pensez-vous qu'il soit mal de prendre un remède pour soulager la douleur si l'on n'est pas en danger de mort ou mourant?

RÉPONSE - Cette question révèle un état d'esprit vraiment déplorable; on pourrait aussi demander s'il est bien d'essayer de se sauver quand on est en train de se noyer, car le fait de tomber à l'eau est également l'effet d'une cause que l'on a provoquée soi-même. Il est certainement de notre devoir de prendre un remède indiqué par une personne qualifiée ou d'essayer de guérir des maux dont nous souffrons par tout autre moyen possible, à notre convenance. Nous serions vraiment dans notre tort si nous laissions notre véhicule physique se délabrer faute de soins et d'attention. Il est l'outil le plus précieux que nous possédions, et à moins que nous nous en servions avec prudence et n'en prenions soin, nous serons justiciables de la loi de cause à effet pour cette négligence.

Une question comme celle qui nous est posée révèle aussi une idée erronée de la loi de cause à effet. Il est de notre devoir de nous efforcer de triompher des circonstances, au lieu de nous laisser mener par elles. Un beau petit poème d'Ella Wheeler Wilcox exprime très bien cette idée:

```
"Un navire fait voile à l'est, l'autre à l'ouest, 
Poussés par le même vent. 
C'est la position de la voilure et non le vent
Qui fixe le chemin qu'ils suivent.

Pareils aux vents des mers sont les chemins du destin 
Alors que nous voyageons à travers la vie; 
Mais c'est l'action de l'âme qui détermine le but 
Et non point le calme ou la tempête."
```

Si nous nous efforçons d'orienter correctement les voiles de la barque de notre vie, nous serons toujours en mesure de modifier, si ce n'est de changer entièrement les conditions et de faire de notre vie ce que nous voulons, au lieu de nous asseoir nonchalamment pour attendre que passent les nuages que nous avons accumulés sur notre tête. Le seul fait que nous les ayons formés devrait nous donner le courage et l'énergie de les faire disparaître, ou de les repousser au plus vite.

### <h3 id="question-37">Question 37</h3>

Quelle méthode de guérison préconisez-vous? Celle des médecins ou celle des guérisseurs, à la manière de la Science Chrétienne, par exemple?

RÉPONSE - Cela dépend de la nature de la maladie et du tempérament du malade. Dans le cas d'une jambe cassée, il est évident qu'un chirugien s'impose. S'il s'agit d'un désordre interne,et qu'il soit possible de faire appel à un médecin à l'esprit large, celui-ci sera très utile dans la plupart des cas. Si, d'autre part, l'on peut faire venir un guérisseur mental, membre de la Science Chrétienne ou tout autre guérisseur spirituel, ils pourront aider une personne dont la foi est forte car, de même qu'un diapason répond aux vibrations d'une autre diapason de même ton, ainsi une personne qui a une foi profonde répondra au traitement de guérisseurs spirituels. Mais si le malade n'a pas confiance en l'efficacité de ces méthodes, il est préférable d'appeler un médecin attitré qui jouisse de la confiance du malade, car la santé ou la maladie dépendent presque entièrement de l'état mental; et lorsqu'une personne est affaiblie par la maladie, elle devient hypersensible, et ne doit pas être contrariée dans ses préférences. De plus, quelle que soit la valeur d'une méthode de guérison, les effets qu'elle aura seront en proportion exacte de la foi de la personne en son pouvoir de guérison.

### <h3 id="question-38">Question 38</h3>

Quelle est votre opinion concernant le jeûne comme moyen de guérison?

RÉPONSE - Il est facile de constater qu'en Occident plus de personnes meurent de trop manger que de ne pas manger suffisamment. Et dans certaines conditions il est sans doute bénéfique de jeûner un jour ou deux, mais s'il existe des gourmands et des gloutons, il y a aussi des personnes qui vont à l'autre extrême et qui jeûnent trop souvent. C'est un grand danger. La meilleure façon de faire est de manger modérément et de consommer le genre de nourriture qui convient; alors le jeûne ne sera pas du tout nécessaire.

Si nous étudions la chimie de l'alimentation, nous voyons que certains aliments possèdent des propriétés précieuses pour notre organisme dans le cas de certains désordres et, consommés de manière adéquate, ces aliments sont de vrais médicaments. Les agrumes, par exemple, sont tous de merveilleux antiseptiques. Ils nettoient et purifient l'appareil digestif. Ils préviennent ainsi la maladie. Les céréales, surtout le riz, sont toutes antitoxiques; elles éliminent la maladie et tuent les germes de la putréfaction. Ainsi, connaissant les propriétés médicinales des divers aliments, nous pouvons très simplement consommer ceux dont nous avons besoin pour guérir nos indispositions ordinaires par la nourriture et non par le jeûne.

### <h3 id="question-39">Question 39</h3>

Estimez-vous que ce soit une erreur d'essayer de guérir une mauvaise habitude telle que l'ivrognerie, par l'hypnotisme?

RÉPONSE - Oui, bien évidemment. Considérées du point de vue d'une seule et unique vie, les méthodes pratiquées par les guérisseurs du "Mouvement Emmanuel", par exemple, produisent sans aucun doute une somme de bien immense. Le patient est assis sur une chaise, on l'endort, et on lui fait ce que l'on appelle des "suggestions". On le réveille, et il est guéri de sa mauvaise habitude; ayant été un ivrogne invétéré, il devient un citoyen respectable, soucieux du bien-être de sa femme et de sa famille et, selon toute apparence, le bien obtenu semble être indéniable.

Mais si l'on considère le cas du point de vue plus profond de l'occultisme qui regarde la vie actuelle comme une vie parmi de nombreuses autres, et que l'on tienne compte de l'effet sur les véhicules invisibles de l'homme, tout est très différent. Pour endormir quelqu'un d'un sommeil hypnotique, l'hypnotiseur fait des passes qui ont pour effet de chasser l'éther de la tête du corps physique, pour y substituer l'éther de l'hypnotiseur. L'hypnotisé est alors sous l'entière domination de l'hypnotiseur; il n'a pas de libre arbitre, et c'est pourquoi les soi-disant "suggestions" sont en réalité des ordres auxquels la victime ne peut qu'obéir. En outre, lorsque l'hypnotiseur réveille son sujet, il lui est impossible de retirer tout l'éther qu'il a introduit en lui. Pour employer une comparaison, voyons ce qui se passe dans une dynamo électrique; une faible partie du magnétisme qu'on y a introduit pour lui permettre de se mettre en marche la première fois, reste comme résidu magnétique pour exciter les champs de la dynamo chaque fois qu'elle se remet en marche. De la même manière, il reste dans le bulbe rachidien du sujet hypnotisé une petite partie de l'éther du corps vital de l'hypnotiseur, qui est pour la victime une menace sa vie durant; et c'est à cause de ce fait que la personne hypnotisée suit invariablement les suggestions qui lui sont imposées et auxquelles elle est contrainte d'obéir encore après son réveil.

Ainsi, la victime d'un guérisseur hypnotiseur ne triomphe pas de sa mauvaise habitude par sa volonté propre, mais elle est tout aussi enchaînée que si elle était emprisonnée dans une cellule; et bien que, dans cette vie, elle puisse sembler être devenue une meilleure personne, quand elle reviendra sur terre, elle aura la même faiblesse qu'ellel devra combattre jusqu'à ce qu'elle en ait triomphé par elle-même.

### <h3 id="question-40">Question 40</h3>

Y a-t-il une méthode propre à éliminer la matière calcaire qui se dépose dans le corps par suite d'une mauvaise alimentation?

RÉPONSE - Cette question prouve que celui qui la pose est instruit du fait que notre corps durcit petit à petit, de l'enfance à la vieillesse, à cause des matières calcaires contenues dans la plupart des aliments qui composent notre nourriture. Cette matière calcaire se dépose d'abord sur les parois des artères et des veines, provoquant l'artériosclérose ou induration des artères. Les artères du petit enfant sont aussi souples et élastiques qu'un tube de caoutchouc, mais à mesure que nous passons de l'enfance à l'adolescence puis de l'âge mûr à la vieillesse, leurs parois se durcissent à cause des dépôts de calcaire laissés par le sang qui y circule. Elles finissent par devenir aussi rigides qu'un tuyau de pipe. Elles sont alors cassantes et peuvent se rompre, occasionnant des hémorragies et la mort. On dit donc à raison qu'un homme a l'âge de ses artères. Si nous réussissons à nettoyer les artères et les vaisseaux capillaires de cette matière calcaire, nous prolongeons de beaucoup notre vie et l'utilité de notre corps.

Du point de vue occulte, naturellement, il importe peu que nous soyons morts ou vivants, car la mort ne signifie pas pour nous l'anéantissement, mais seulement le déplacement de la conscience vers d'autres sphères; néanmoins, quand nous avons conduit un véhicule physique à travers les années inutiles de l'enfance, celles de la bouillante jeunesse, et que nous sommes arrivés à l'âge de la sagesse où nous commençons vraiment à acquérir de l'expérience, alors, plus longtemps nous pourrons prolonger cette période d'expérience, plus nous en retirerons de profit. Prolonger la vie du corps a donc beaucoup de valeur.

Pour arriver à ce résultat, nous devons d'abord choisir les aliments qui contiennent le moins possible de ces substances qui durcissent et obstruent les artères et les capillaires. D'une manière générale, ce sont les fruits et les légumes verts qui en contiennent le moins. Ensuite, il importe d'éliminer les matières calcaires déjà absorbées. Mais la science n'a pas encore découvert les aliments ou les médicaments capables de produire cet effet en toute certitude. Les bains électriques se sont révélés assez efficaces, mais pas entièrement satisfaisants. Le babeurre est le meilleur agent éliminatoire de ce résidu calcaire. Le jus de raisin vient ensuite; pris en quantité suffisante et régulièrement, ces deux aliments réduisent considérablement l'induration des artères.

### <h3 id="question-41">Question 41</h3>

La nature n'est-elle pas à l'origine des fréquentes malformations physiques dans les règnes végétal et animal aussi bien que dans la race humaine? Et une intelligence parfaitement saine et équilibrée, doublée d'une grande force de volonté, peut-elle habiter un corps malade et difforme?

RÉPONSE - Nous demanderons "qu'entendez-vous par la nature?" Bacon déclare que la nature et Dieu diffèrent l'un de l'autre comme l'empreinte diffère du sceau. La nature est le symbole visible de Dieu, et nous avons trop tendance à penser à la nature, de nos jours, dans un sens matérialiste. Derrière chaque manifestation de la nature il y a des forces, non pas des forces aveugles, mais des intelligences. Peut-être un exemple nous fera-t-il comprendre quels rapports nous avons avec elles.

Supposons que, munis des matériaux et des outils nécessaires, nous soyons occupés à fabriquer une table, et qu'un chien, à côté de nous, nous observe. Ce chien, un être d'un règne inférieur, nous voit d'abord raboter le bois, puis ajuster les planches du dessus et poser les pieds; il verra la table prendre forme sous ces yeux; il peut observer le processus bien qu'il puisse ne pas connaître l'emploi de la table ni comprendre ce qu'il y a dans notre intellect pendant que nous façonnons la table. Il aperçoit simplement une manifestation, il nous voit travailler et aperçoit les résultats. Supposons encore, pour rendre notre exemple plus probant, que le chien puisse seulement voir les matériaux et la manière dont ils sont assemblés pour former une table, mais qu'il ne puisse nous voir travailler, ni assembler les pièces destinées à former la table; le chien serait alors à peu près dans la même relation par rapport à nous, que nous le sommes par rapport aux forces de la nature. Ce que nous appelons électricité, magnétisme, expansion de la vapeur, etc., sont des intelligences qui travaillent, invisibles à nos yeux, lorsque certaines conditions sont réalisées. Les esprits de la nature construisent les plantes, forment les cristaux de roche, et avec de nombreuses hiérarchies ils travaillent autour de nous et pour nous, invisibles, mais néanmoins occupés à élaborer ce à quoi nous donnons le nom de nature.

Tous ces êtres sont en train d'évoluer, comme nous, et le seul fait qu'ils soient en train d'évoluer montre qu'ils sont imparfaits et, par conséquent, susceptibles de commettre des erreurs d'où résultent naturellement des malformations. On peut donc dire, en réponse à la question posée, que les intelligences invisibles qui élaborent ce que nous appelons la nature se rendent coupables, comme nous, de fréquentes erreurs.

Quant à la deuxième partie de la question, qui demande si une intelligence parfaitement saine et équilibrée, doublée d'une grande force de volonté, peut habiter un corps malade ou difforme, nous répondrons, "oui, sans aucun doute", mais comme cette intelligence, pour s'exprimer, est dépendante de l'efficacité de son instrument physique, elle peut évidemment se trouver gênée par la difformité physique, tout comme l'efficacité de l'ouvrier le plus habile dépend dans une large mesure de la qualité de ses outils.

### <h3 id="question-42">Question 42</h3>

Quel est l'effet de la vaccination du point de vue occulte?

RÉPONSE - Les bactériologues ont découvert que beaucoup de maladies sont causées par des micro-organismes qui envahissent notre corps, et que lorsque cette horde a commencé d'y créer des désordres, le corps se met à produire des germes de nature opposée ou une substance propre à empoisonner les envahisseurs. Reste à savoir qui l'emportera, des attaquants ou des défenseurs. Si ces derniers sont plus nombreux que les premiers, ou si la substance nocive pour les envahisseurs est produite en quantité suffisante, le malade guérit. Si les défenseurs sont vaincus, ou si le corps ne peut produire l'antitoxine en quantité nécessaire à la destruction des envahisseurs, le malade succombe à la maladie. On découvrit en outre que lorsqu'une personne s'est guérie d'une certaine maladie, elle est immunisée contre de nouvelles attaques de celle-ci, pour la bonne raison qu'elle possède dans son organisme l'antitoxine destructrice des micropbes ayant provoqué la maladie.

On peut tirer des faits énoncés ci-dessus les conclusions suivantes:

(1) Si l'on inocule à une personne saine une petite quantité des germes d'une certaine maladie, elle contractera cette maladie sous une forme bégnigne, car elle sera en mesure de produire l'antitoxine salvatrice qui l'immunisera à l'avenir contre cette même maladie.

Tel est le principe de la vaccination employée comme moyen préventif.

(2) Quand une personne ayant contracté une certaine maladie se trouve dans l'incapacité de produire la quantité d'antitoxine nécessaire à la destruction des micro-organismes envahisseurs, on pourra lui sauver la vie en lui inoculant le sérum produit pas un autre organisme déjà immunisé.

Comme il est difficile de se servir d'êtres humains pour obtenir ces cultures microbiennes et ces antitoxines, on a recours aux animaux pour la culture des germes. On a beaucoup parlé, beaucoup écrit, pour ou contre l'usage de telles mélthodes de lutte contre la maladie. Nous ne nous occuperons pas ici de ce problème; le demandeur pose la question au point de vue occulte qui va plus au fond des choses que si on le considère du côté matériel de la vie. Il y a sans aucun doute des cas où la maladie a été prévenue par la vaccination, et où la mort a été évitée par l'emploi d'une antitoxine; il y a aussi des cas où le vaccin et l'antitoxine ont causé le malheur qu'ils étaient censés prévenir, mais cela est en dehors de la question. Du point de vue occulte, la vaccination et l'emploi d'antitoxines obtenus par les procédés en usage dans les instituts bactériologiques sont déplorables. Ces méthodes font du tort aux animaux sans défense, et empoisonnent le corps humain, qui devient pour l'Ego un instrument difficile à utiliser.

Si nous étudions la chimie de notre alimentation, nous découvrirons que la nature a fourni tous les remèdes nécessaires, et si nous nous alimentons correctement, nous serons immunisés contre toutes les maladies, sans vaccination.

Lorsqu'il est en bonne santé, le corps spécialise une bien plus grande quantité d'énergie solaire qu'il ne peut en utiliser. Le surplus rayonne de toute la surface du corps avec une grande force et empêche l'entrée des micro- organismes qui manquent de la force nécessaire pour lutter contre ce courant sortant. De plus, selon le principe qu'un ventilateur attire les particules de poussière de la pièce pour les rejeter vers l'extérieur, ce fluide vital nettoie le corps des matières dangereuses, y compris les microbes pathogènes. Cela ne nous suprendra pas d'apprendre que cette force est intelligente et capable de sélectionner les matières qui doivent être éliminées, laissant celles qui sont utiles et bienfaisantes. Les scientifiques reconnaissent le fait de l'osmose sélective. Si un tamis laisse passer indistinctement tout ce qui n'a pas un plus grand volume que ses mailles, par contre, des organes comme les reins conserveront les liquides utiles au corps pour ne laisser filtrer que les déchets nuisibles à l'organisme. Le fluide vital opère de la même manière, avec discernement; il débarrasse le corps des toxines et des impuretés produites à l'intérieur, en même temps qu'il repousse celles venant de l'extérieur.

Des scientifiques de Nancy ont découvert ces émanations au moyen de réactifs chimiques qui les rendent lumineuses. Ils leur ont donné le nom de fluide odique, ou rayons N. C'est au cours de la digestion que ces émanations sont les plus faibles, parce qu'à ce moment une très grand quantité d'énergie solaire est nécessaire à l'intérieur du corps dans le métabolisme des aliments; c'est le facteur de cohésion de l'assimilation. Plus nous avons mangé, plus grande est la quantité de fluide vital employée à l'intérieur du corps et plus faible le flux protecteur qui élimine vers l'extérieur les micro-organismes. Il en résulte que nous sommes en plus grand danger d'être envahis par une armée de microbes quand nous mangeons avec excès.

Si au contraire, nous mangeons modérément, si nous choisissons des aliments dont la digestion est très facile, la diminution du courant vital protecteur sera alors minime et notre immunité contre la maladie sera beaucoup accrue sans qu'il soit nécessaire d'empoisonner notre corps avec des vaccins.

### <h3 id="question-43">Question 43</h3>

Si, comme vous le dites, l'Ego réside dans le sang, la transfusion du sang d'une personne saine à une personne malade n'est-elle pas dangereuse? N'affecte-t-elle par les Egos et si oui, de quelle manière?

RÉPONSE - Parmi les récentes découvertes de la science, il y a l'hémolyse, qui est le fait que l'inoculation du sang des veines d'un animal d'une espèce supérieure dans celui d'un animal d'une espèce inférieure détruit le sang de ce dernier et cause sa mort. C'est ainsi que le sang humain est fatal à l'animal dans les veines duquel il est injecté. Mais la transfusion d'homme à homme peut se faire, bien qu'il en résulte parfois des effets nuisibles.

Jadis, les gens se mariaient dans la famille; on regardait avec horreur celui ou celle qui épousait une étrangère ou un étranger. Quand les fils de Dieu s'unirent aux filles des hommes, c'est-à-dire quand les sujets d'un chef allaient chercher leurs épouses en dehors de la tribu, cela occasionnait de grands désordres, ils étaient chassés par leur chef et voués à la destruction, car, à cette époque reculée, certaines qualités que nous possédons maintenant devaient être développées dans toute l'humanité, et elles étaient alors implantées dans le sang commun à tous qui coulait pur de tout mélange dans tous les membres de la même famille ou petite tribu. Par la suite, dans le but d'amener l'homme dans des conditions plus matérielles, les mariages internationaux furent ordonnés, et dès lors, il fut considéré comme horrible, également, que des personnes de la même famille soient unies par les liens du mariage.

Les anciens Vikings ne permettaient à personne de contracter une union dans leurs familles tant que cette personne n'avait pas passé l'épreuve du mélange des sangs, pour savoir si la transfusion du sang de l'étranger dans celui de la famille serait ou non préjudiciable. La raison en est que l'humanité d'alors n'était pas individualisée comme elle l'est de nos jours. Les hommes étaient davantage sous la domination de l'esprits de race ou de l'esprit de famille qui demeurait dans leur sang, de même que l'esprit-groupe se trouve dans le sang des animaux. Plus tard, les mariages internationaux furent ordonnés afin de libérer l'humanité de ce joug et faire de chaque Ego distinct le maître absolu de son propre corps, sans interférence extérieure.

Enfin la science a découvert que le sang de personnes diffé rentes contient des cristaux différents, en sorte qu'il est possible maintenant de distinguer le sang d'un Blanc de celui d'un Noir; et le temps viendra où l'on pourra observer des différences plus grandes encore, car cette différence, que l'on peut noter entre les cristaux formés par les différentes races humaines, existe également entre les cristaux formés par chaque individu. Les empreintes des doigts de deux personnes ne se ressemblent pas, et on découvrira plus tard que le sang de chaque être humain est différent de celui d'un autre individu. Cette différence est déjà évidente aux yeux de l'investigateur occulte, et ce n'est qu'une question de temps pour que la science fasse cette découverte car les caractéristiques distinctives deviennent de plus en plus marquées à mesure que l'être humain devient de moins en moins dépendant, de plus en plus auto- suffisant.

Ce changement dans le sang est de la plus grande importance, et quand il sera plus prononcé, à l'avenir, il entraînera des conséquences d'une immense portée. On dit que "la nature géométrise", et la nature n'est que le symbole visible d'un Dieu invisible dont nous sommes les descendants faits à son image. Faits à Sa ressemblance, nous commençons aussi à géométriser, et naturellement, nous commençons à le faire dans la substance où nous, esprits humains, Egos, avons le pouvoir le plus grand, c'est-à-dire dans notre sang.

Quand le sang court dans les artères logées profondément dans le corps, c'est un gaz; mais la perte de chaleur qui se produit près de la surface du corps le fait se condenser partiellement, et c'est dans cette substance que l'Ego est en train d'apprendre à former des cristaux minéraux. Dans la Période de Jupiter, nous apprendrons à les revêtir d'une forme inférieure de vitalité et à les extérioriser de nous-mêmes sous forme de structures semblables aux plantes. Dans la Période de Vénus, nous serons capables de leur infuser le désir, et de les rendre semblables aux animaux. Finalement, dans la Période de Vulcain, nous leur donnerons un intellect et les gouvernerons en étant leurs esprits de race.

Actuellement, nous sommes tout au début de cette individualisation de notre sang. C'est pourquoi il est possible, à présent, de transfuser le sang d'un être humain à un autre, mais le jour est proche où cela sera impossible. Le sang d'un Blanc tuera tout ce qui lui est inférieur, et le sang d'une personne évoluée intoxiquera une personne moins cultivée. De nos jours, l'enfant reçoit de ses parents sa provision de sang, et celle-ci est mise en réserve dans la glande appelée thymus, pour être utilisée dans les années d'enfance. Mais il arrivera un moment où l'Ego sera beaucoup trop individualisé pour fonctionner dans un sang qu'il n'aura pas généré lui-même. Alors le mode actuel de procréation sera remplacé par un autre grâce auquel l'Ego pourra créer son propre véhicule sans l'aide de parents.

### <h3 id="question-44">Question 44</h3>

Quelles sont les causes de l'aliénation mentale?

RÉPONSE - Pour répondre à cette question, il faudrait des volumes, mais nous pouvons dire que, selon le point de vue de l'occultiste, il y a quatre sortes d'aliénation.

L'aliénation mentale est toujours causée par une rupture dans la chaîne des véhicules entre l'Ego et le corps physique, rupture qui peut se produire entre les centres du cerveau et le corps vital, entre le corps vital et le corps du désir, entre le corps du désir et l'intellect ou corps mental, ou entre l'intellect et l'Ego. La rupture peut être complète ou seulement partielle.

Lorsque la rupture se trouve entre les centres du cerveau et le corps vital, ou entre le corps vital et le corps du désir, nous avons les idiots. Lorsque la rupture se produit entre le corps du désir et l'intellect, alors l'impulsif et violent corps du désir est maître, et nous avons le fou furieux. Si la rupture se trouve entre l'Ego et l'intellect, c'est l'intellect qui domine les autres véhicules et nous avons le fou rusé qui saura tromper son gardien en lui faisant croire qu'il est parfaitement inoffensif, jusqu'à ce qu'il ait réussi à mettre à exécution un plan diabolique et rusé. Alors son dérangement mental peut se découvrir soudain, et causer une catastrophe terrible.

Il existe une autre cause d'aliénation que nous ferions bien d'expliquer, car il est parfois possible de l'éviter.Lorsque l'Ego est sur le point de quitter le monde invisible pour renaître, on lui montre les diverses existences qui lui sont accessibles. Il voit se dérouler la vie à venir, dans ses événements importants et généraux, comme un film passant devant sa vision. Habituellement, le choix lui est donné entre plusieurs vies. Il voit en même temps les leçons qu'il a à apprendre, la destinée qu'il a générée pour lui- même dans des vies passées, et quelle partie de cette destinée il aura à liquider dans chacune des vies offertes. Puis il fait son choix et il est guidé par les Anges de Justice vers le pays et la famille où sa vie doit être vécue.

Cette vue panoramique est vue au Troisième Ciel, où l'Ego est dépouillé de tout véhicule et se sent spirituellement au-dessus des considérations matérielles sordides. Là, l'Ego est beaucoup plus sage qu'il n'apparaît ici sur terre où il est aveuglé par la chair à un degré inconcevable. Plus tard, quand la conception a lieu et que l'Ego pénètre dans la matrice de sa mère dix-huit jours environ après cet événement, il entre en contact avec le moule éthérique de son nouveau corps physique, moule élaboré par les Anges de Justice afin de donner au cerveau la formation qui imprimera sur l'Ego les tendances nécessaires à mener à bien sa destinée.

A ce moment, l'Ego revoit dans un éclair les images de sa vie à venir, à la façon dont un noyé revoit les images de sa vie qui se termine. A ce moment, l'Ego a presque perdu de vue sa nature spirituelle, de sorte que si la vie à venir semble être difficile, il lui arrive parfois d'hésiter à pénétrer dans la matrice, et à établir les connexions nécessaires avec le cerveau. Il peut essayer de se retirer, ce qui fait que le corps physique et le corps vital, au lieu d'être concentriques comme il se doit, le corps vital, formé d'éther, peut être partiellement tiré au-dessus de la tête du corps dense. Dans ce cas, la connexion entre les centres sensoriels du corps vital et le corps dense est interrompue, ce qui produit l'idiotie congénitale, l'épilepsie, la chorée ou autres désordres nerveux de même nature.

La relation inharmonieuse qui existe parfois entre les parents est souvent la goutte qui fait déborder le vase et qui fait que l'Ego sent qu'il ne peut pas entrer dans un tel milieu. Ainsi, on ne saurait trop insister, auprès des futurs parents, sur le fait que durant la période de gestation,il est de la plus haute importance que tout soit fait pour garder la mère dans un état de contentement et d'harmonie. Car c'est une très rude tâche pour l'Ego de pénétrer dans la matrice; toute sa sensibilité est durement mise à l'épreuve, et le manque d'harmonie dans le foyer qui sera le sien est naturellement une source supplémentaire de malaise qui peut avoir pour résultat le terrible état de choses mentionné ci-dessus.

### <h3 id="question-45">Question 45</h3>

Lorsqu'une personne qui souffre de démence meurt, sera-t-elle encore dans le même état dans le Monde du Désir?

RÉPONSE - Cela dépend de l'endroit où se trouve la rupture, car la démence est une rupture dans les véhicules entre l'Ego et le corps physique, et ce dérangement peut survenir entre l'Ego et l'intellect, entre l'intellect et le corps du désir, ou entre le corps du désir et le corps vital et aussi entre le corps vital et le corps dense. Si la rupture se trouve entre le corps physique et le corps vital ou entre le corps vital et le corps du désir, l'Ego aura toute sa raison dans le Monde du Désir aussitôt après la mort, parce qu'il a alors quitté les deux véhicules qui étaient affectés.

Lorsque la rupture a lieu entre le corps du désir et l'intellect, le corps du désir est, bien évidemment, encore violent, et cause souvent à l'Ego beaucoup de tourments dans son existence dans le Monde du Désir; car il va de soi que l'Ego ne souffre jamais de démence. Ce qui apparaît comme folie vient du fait que l'Ego n'a pas le contrôle de ses véhicules; le pire de tout est évidemment que l'intellect lui-même soit affecté et que l'Ego soit lié à la personnalité pour une longue période, jusqu'à ce que tous les véhicules soient entièrement détruits.

<h2 id="section-2">Partie 2 - Question Concernant la Vie Après la Mort</h2>

### <h3 id="question-46">Question 46</h3>

Quelle est l'utilité de connaître l'état qui suit la mort, de savoir ce qui se passe dans le monde invisible, et toutes ces choses? N'est- il pas préférable de connaître un monde à la fois? A chaque jour suffit sa peine. Pourquoi se charger d'autres soucis?

RÉPONSE - Si nous savions sans doute aucun, que nous serons un jour forcés de quitter notre pays, pour aller vivre ailleurs durant de très nombreuses années avant d'être autorisés à revenir au premier endroit, ne serait-il pas de bonne politique de nous familiariser avec la langue, les coutumes et les lois de ce nouveau pays? Ainsi préparés, nous ne nous sentirions pas trop dépaysés, et nous serions capables de tirer parti de toutes les occasions de croissance et d'étude que nous trouverions là; nous n'irions pas à l'encontre des lois de ce pays et éviterions ainsi de nous attirer les désagréments dus à notre ignorance, et de bien des manières il serait avantageux pour nous de connaître ce pays.

Ce qui précède s'applique aussi bien aux Mondes Invisibles. Après la mort, c'est là que nous nous trouverons, et si nous pouvons obtenir maintenant des renseignements sur les conditions qui y règnent, nous en bénéficierons certainement beaucoup. Il y a tout d'abord l'avantage que cette connaissance écartera de nous la peur de la mort, car nous ne craignons jamais ce que nous connaissons. Deuxièmement, connaissant ce qui a trait au Purgatoire et au Premier Ciel, connaisant ce qui concerne l'exercice du soir au cours duquel nous revoyons les événements de la journée en ordre inverse, nous pouvons vivre notre Purgatoire ici et maintenant, par petites doses, obtenant ainsi le pardon de nos péchés, au lieu d'attendre d'expier nos mauvaises actions; et si nous tirons parti de nos connaissances, nous vivrons dans une attitude que nous n'aurions pas avant de commencer nos vies futures, puisque nous assimilons chaque jour le bien que nous avons fait et nous éliminons le mal. Ainsi, il nous sera possible de nous élever à travers le Purgatoire et le Premier Ciel immédiatement après la mort.

En connaissant déjà les tâches que nous aurons à accomplir au Deuxième Ciel, nous pourrons nous appliquer avec plus d'intelligence à ce travail; nous acquérons une conscience plus large de ce royaume en nous familiarisant quotidiennement avec lui. Ainsi nous préparerons-nous, de diverses manières, à devenir des Aides Invisibles, à vivre consciemment en tout temps, et à écourter notre évolution de millions d'années.

### <h3 id="question-47">Question 47</h3>

La durée d'une vie terrestre est-elle déterminée avant la naissance?

RÉPONSE - Oui, au moment où l'Ego se prépare à renaître, il forme l'archétype créateur de sa forme physique au Deuxième Ciel, avec l'assistance des Hiérarchies Créatrices. Cet archétype est une chose qui chante et vibre, qui est mis en vibration par l'Ego, avec une certaine force, proportionnée à la longueur de la vie qui doit être vécue sur terre; et la forme qui est construite avec les éléments chimiques de la terre continuera à vivre jusqu'à ce cet archétype cesse de vibrer.

Cependant, la loi de cause à effet détermine la façon dont la vie doit être vécue, et certaines occasions de croissance spirituelle sont offertes à l'Ego à différents moments de sa vie terrestre. S'il utilise ces occasions, la vie se poursuit selon le tracé voulu; sinon, elle dévie dans une impasse, pourrait-on dire, et les Hiérarchies Créatrices y mettent fin en détruisant l'archétype dans le Monde Céleste. Nous pouvons donc dire que la durée d'une vie terrestre est déterminée avant que nous naissions physiquement, mais la vie peut être abrégée si nous négligeons certaines occasions. Il y a aussi quelques rares cas où la vie ayant été vécue dans toute sa plénitude, la personne ayant toujours cherché à être à la hauteur des occasions qui se sont présentées à elle, une prolongation de vie est infusée dans l'archétype, mais comme précisé cela est exceptionnel.

### <h3 id="question-48">Question 48</h3>

Est-il possible d'abréger le laps de temps entre la mort et une nouvelle naissance afin de hâter notre évolution, et si oui, comment?

RÉPONSE - Oui, cela est possible à toute personne qui se donne la peine de passer en revue, en sens inverse, les événements de la journée, depuis le soir jusqu'au matin, en se jugeant pour les erreurs commises et en prenant la résolution de les réparer de son mieux. En agissant ainsi, elle efface de sa vie les péchés commis et devient progressivement une personne bien meilleure que celles qui ne pratiquent pas ce simple exercice. Ainsi, les péchés qui autrement auraient été expurgés au Purgatoire, ont déjà été effacés durant la vie terrestre, et l'existence au Purgatoire en est matériellement écourtée. Lorsque, pendant cet exercice du soir, la personne revoit le bien qu'elle a fait et se promet d'essayer de faire mieux encore à l'avenir, elle assimile aussi le bien qu'elle fait chaque jour, et acquiert ainsi une très forte croissance de l'âme, ce qui lui permettra d'éviter aussi la vie au Premier Ciel. Une telle personne est définitivement engagée sur la sentier de l'Initiation; elle est alors en réalité en dehors des lois ordinaires qui gouvernent l'humanité, car c'est un aide dans l'évolution et, c'est pourquoi des occasions de retourner sur terre lui seront données dans ce but, et bien plus tôt que cela n'aurait été le cas autrement.

### <h3 id="question-49">Question 49</h3>

Y a-t-il dans l'autre monde des saisons, des années, des ères et des époques?

RÉPONSE - Non. Nous pouvons dire qu'il n'y a qu'un seul long jour. Le temps n'y existe pas, car ici-bas le temps existe à cause de la rotation de la terre sur son axe et de sa révolution orbitale autour du Soleil. Ce sont ces mouvements qui font le jour et la nuit, l'été et l'hiver, la chaleur et le froid, etc., parce que la composition solide et opaque de la terre la rend impénétrable aux rayons de lumière et de chaleur émis par le Soleil, de sorte qu'une moitié de la terre est toujours sombre et froide. Mais, dans cet autre monde, rien n'est opaque ou solide, c'est pourquoi il n'y a là ni chaud ni froid, ni été ni hiver, il n'y a ni jour ni nuit, mais un long jour lumineux.

C'est la raison pour laquelle ceux qui sont décédés et ont passé dans l'autre monde, tout en se rappelant parfaitement leur dernière vie sur terre, n'ont pas le sentiment du temps qui s'est écoulé depuis leur mort, et s'en enquièrent parfois.

Il n'y a qu'une méthode pour mesurer le temps dans l'au-delà, et le clairvoyant exercé l'emploie pour fixer les événements lorsqu'il lit dans la mémoire de la nature, et c'est l'astrologie qui lui permet de noter la position des astres. Si l'événement qu'il recherche s'est passé à une époque historique, il peut en fixer la date en la rapprochant d'un fait historique qui s'est produit au même moment; mais lorsqu'il s'agit de remonter à des milliers et des milliers d'années en arrière, par exemple lorsqu'il désire déterminer le moment des déluges de l'Atlantide, il utilise en particulier la précession des équinoxes, qui est le mouvement rétrograde du Soleil à travers les douze constellations du zodiaque, un mouvement qui demande vingt-six mille ans environ au Soleil pour en faire le tour. Il peut ainsi lire en arrière dans le temps jusqu'au moment des déluges de l'Atlantide, en comptant combien de période de vingt-six mille ans se sont écoulées entre le premier et le second déluge, entre le second et le troisième, puis le nombre d'années depuis le troisième jusqu'à notre époque. S'il ignore la science des étoiles, il ne peut le faire, c'est donc une raison de plus pour l'étudiant en occultisme de se familiariser avec l'astronomie.

### <h3 id="question-50">Question 50</h3>

Une personne enterrée vivante prend-elle conscience de sa condition? Comment l'Esprit peut-il retourner à son corps enfermé dans la tombe?

RÉPONSE - D'après le changement de position du corps à l'intérieur du cercueil, il est évident que parfois lorsque celui-ci a été enterré avant que l'esprit l'ait définitivement quitté, l'esprit y est revenu et lui a fait faire des efforts désespérés pour trouver l'air indispensable. Et cela indiquerait que le corps avait repris conscience, car la nature solide de la terre et du cer cueil n'empêche aucunement l'esprit d'aller et venir. Un esprit traverse une muraille ou tout autre obstacle opaque ou dense avec la même facilité que nous passons à travers l'air.

### <h3 id="question-51">Question 51</h3>

Pourquoi les enfants meurent-ils?

RÉPONSE - La mortalité infantile a plusieurs causes. Nous en donnerons ici quelques-unes parmi les principales. Premièrement lorsqu'un Ego retourne à la vie sur terre, il est attiré vers une certaine famille car il peut y obtenir l'environnement qui est calculé pour assurer ses progrès et où il puisse aussi liquider une certaine partie de la destinée générée par lui dans des existences précédentes. Aussi, lorsque les parents font des changements tels dans leur vie, que l'Ego ne peut plus y faire les expériences voulues ni liquider cette destinée, il est enlevé à cette famille pour être envoyé dans un autre lieu où il trouvera les conditions requises. Il peut aussi arriver qu'il soit provisoirement retiré de ce milieu pour y renaître au moment où les conditions voulues se présentent enfin. Mais il y a une cause qui est responsable de la mortalité infantile, et qui doit être recherchée bien antérieurement, c'est-à-dire dans des vies précédentes et, pour la bien comprendre, il est nécessaire de savoir ce qui se passe au moment de la mort et immédiatement après.

Lorsqu'un esprit quitte définitivement son corps, il emporte avec lui le corps du désir, l'intellect et le corps vital, et le corps vital contient à ce moment-là l'enregistrement des images de la vie qui vient de prendre fin. Ces images sont alors imprimées dans le corps du désir pendant les trois jours et demi qui suivent immédiatement la mort. Le corps du désir devient donc l'arbitre de la destinée de l'homme au Purgatoire et au Premier Ciel. Les souffrances endurées par l'expurgation du mal, et la joie causée par la contemplation des bonnes actions de la vie écoulée, sont transmises, dans la vie suivante, sous forme de conscience qui avertit l'homme de ne pas perpétuer les erreurs des vies antérieures et l'incite à faire ce qui lui a procuré la joie la plus grande dans sa précédente vie.

Lorsque ceux qui entourent un mourant éclatent en sanglots au moment où l'esprit quitte le corps, et poursuivent leurs lamentations dans la chambre mortuaire durant les quelques jours qui suivent le décès, l'esprit qui, pendant tout ce temps est en contact étroit avec le Monde Physique, sera bouleversé par le chagrin des êtres qui lui sont chers, et sera empêché de bien centrer son attention sur le panorama de sa vie passée; et l'impression faite sur le corps du désir sera beaucoup moins profonde qu'elle ne l'aurait été si l'esprit avait été laissé dans la paix et le calme. En conséquence, les souffrances au Purgatoire ne seront pas aussi vives, ni les joies au Premier Ciel aussi profondes qu'elles auraient dû l'être; ainsi, lorsque l'Ego renaîtra à nouveau sur terre, il aura perdu une partie de l'expérience de son existence précédente. C'est-à-dire que la voix de la conscience ne parlera pas avec la même force que si la tranquillité avait régné autour de la dépouille.

Afin de compenser cette perte, l'Ego renaît, le plus généralement chez les parents ou amis qui se sont lamentés à sa mort, et il leur est enlevé dans l'enfance. Il entre alors dans le Monde du Désir, mais comme un petit enfant n'a pas de péchés à expurger, son corps du désir et son intellect restent intacts; il va alors directement au Premier Ciel pour y attendre le moment favorable à une nouvelle renaissance. Ce temps d'attente est employé à lui enseigner directement les effets des différentes émotions, aussi bien bonnes que mauvaises. Souvent c'est un parent ou un ami qui vient au-devant de lui et qui s'occupe de lui enseigner ce qu'il a perdu par les lamentations auxquelles s'étaient livré ses proches. De toute façon, la perte est plus que réparée; de telle sorte que lorsque l'enfant renaît une seconde fois, il a atteint un degré de croissance morale égal à celui auquel il serait parvenu si son passage dans l'au-delà n'avait pas été troublé.

### <h3 id="question-52">Question 52</h3>

Quelle est la cause du grand nombre de décès dans la première enfance et dans l'enfance?

RÉPONSE - Lorsqu'à la mort l'esprit quitte le corps, il emporte avec lui l'intellect, le corps du désir et le corps vital. Ce dernier contient l'enregistrement des images de la vie passée. Et pendant les trois jours et demi qui suivent la mort, ces scènes se gravent dans le corps du désir pour former la base de la vie de l'homme au Purgatoire et au Premier Ciel, où le mal est expurgé et le bien assimilé. Les expériences de la vie elle-même sont oubliées, comme nous avons oublié le processus d'apprentissage de l'écriture, mais nous en avons conservé la faculté. C'est ainsi que l'extrait cumulé de toutes les expériences des vies terrestres écoulées et aussi des existences passées au Purgatoire et au Premier Ciel est conservé par l'homme et forme son "avoir" pour la prochaine naissance. Les souffrances qu'il a endurées lui parlent et c'est la voix de la conscience, alors que le bien qu'il a fait lui donne un caractère plus altruiste.

Lorsque les trois jours et demi qui suivent immédiatement la mort se passent dans la paix et le calme, l'Ego peut se concentrer beaucoup mieux sur le panorama de sa vie passée et l'impression de celui-ci sur le corps du désir sera plus profonde que s'il est troublé par les lamentations hystériques de ses proches ou par d'autres causes. Il éprouvera en conséquence un sentiment très net de la souffrance dans le Purgatoire et de la joie dans le Premier Ciel; et, dans les vies futures, ce sentiment très net sera ressenti sans possibilité d'erreur. Mais si les lamentations de sa famille et de ses amis ont détourné son attention, ou bien si le défunt est mort par accident, peut- être dans une rue très passante, lors du déraillement d'un train, dans un incendie, sur le champ de bataille ou dans des circonstances déchirantes, il ne pourra se concentrer comme il le faudrait. Il ne serait pas juste cependant qu'il perde les expériences de sa vie passée, du fait qu'il est décédé d'une manière si malencontreuse, aussi la loi de cause à effet donne une compensation.

Nous pensons généralement que lorsqu'un enfant naît, il naît et c'est tout; mais, de même que pendant la gestation, le corps physique est protégé contre les impacts du monde extérieur, puisqu'il est placé dans la matrice de la mère jusqu'à ce qu'il soit arrivé à une maturité suffisante pour affronter les conditions extérieures, ainsi le corps vital, le corps du désir et l'intellect sont aussi en état de gestation, et naissent plus tard car ils n'ont pas eu une aussi longue évolution que le corps physique, et c'est pourquoi il leur faut plus de temps pour arriver à un état de maturité suffisant pour être individualisés. Le corps vital naît dans la septième année lorsque commence la période de croissance excessive; le corps du désir naît au moment de la puberté, dans la quatorzième année; et l'intellect naît à vingt-et-un ans, lorsqu'on dit que l'enfant est devenu un homme ou une femme et qu'il a atteint l'âge de la majorité.

Ce qui n'a pas été vivifié ne peut mourir; aussi lorsqu'un enfant meurt avant la naissance du corps du désir, il passe directement dans le Premier Ciel. Il ne peut aller ni dans le Deuxième Ciel ni dans le Troisième Ciel parce que le corps du désir et le mental, n'étant pas nés, ne peuvent pas non plus mourir; l'Ego attend donc dans le Premier Ciel que l'occasion s'offre pour lui de renaître. Lorsqu'il est mort dans une des circonstances bouleversantes mentionnées plus haut, qui ont empêché le bien et le mal de sa vie passée de se graver assez fortement sur son corps du désir, comme cela aurait été le cas s'il était mort en paix, il renaît pour mourir dans l'enfance et il est instruit pendant son séjour au Premier Ciel des effets des passions et des désirs, afin d'apprendre les leçons qu'il aurait apprises au Purgatoire si sa mort n'avait pas été troublée. Quand il renaît, c'est avec un degré de développement de sa conscience qui lui permet de poursuivre son évolution.

Comme dans le passé l'homme a toujours été très belliqueux et comme, d'autre part, il n'a pas observé, dans son ignorance, le silence et la paix autour des morts, organisant des veillées mortuaires autour de ceux qui mouraient dans leur lit et qui étaient peu nombreux en comparaison de ceux qui étaient tués sur le champ de bataille, il en résulte une énorme mortalité infantile. Mais comme les humains comprennent mieux les choses, qu'ils se rendent compte qu'ils sont surtout le gardien de leur frère lorsque celui-ci quitte cette vie et qu'ils peuvent l'aider énormément en restant calme et en priant, la mortalité infantile diminuera et ne sera plus ce qu'elle est actuellement.

### <h3 id="question-53">Question 53</h3>

L'incinération du corps physique après la mort affecte-t-elle l'esprit d'une manière quelconque?

RÉPONSE - Pendant la vie et dans l'état de conscience de veille, les véhicules de l'Ego s'interpénètrent et sont concentriques; mais à la mort, l'Ego, revêtu de l'intellect et du corps du désir, se retire du corps dense, et comme les fonctions vitales ont pris fin, le corps vital, lui aussi, se retire du corps dense qu'il laisse inanimé sur le lit.Un petit atome sort du coeur et, avec le temps, le corps physique se désagrège complètement. Mais dès que la mort a eu lieu, un processus d'une extrême importance se déroule , et ceux qui, dans la chambre mortuaire, assistent l'esprit qui s'en va, doivent avoir soin de faire régner là et dans toute la maison, la plus parfaite tranquillité, car les images de toute la vie qui vient de prendre fin et qui sont enregistrées dans le corps vital, sont en train de passer devant les yeux de l'esprit, en une progression lente et ordonnée, en sens inverse, c'est-à- dire de la mort à la naissance. Ce panorama de la vie écoulée dure de quelques heures à trois jours et demi; cette durée dépend de la puissance du corps vital, qui détermine la durée pendant laquelle une personne peut rester éveillée dans les circonstances les plus impérieuses. Certaines personnes peuvent travailler pendant cinquante, soixante ou même soixante-dix heures d'affilée avant d'être épuisées, alors que d'autres ne peuvent rester éveillées que quelques heures seulement. La raison pour laquelle il est de la plus haute importance de maintenir le calme le plus absolu dans la chambre mortuaire et la maison pendant trois jours et demi est la suivante: pendant ce temps, le panorama de la vie passée est imprimé dans le corps du désir qui sera le véhicule de l'Ego au Purgatoire et au Premier Ciel, où celui-ci récolte le bien et le mal qu'il a semés selon les actions de sa vie terrestre.

Quand la vie a été remplie d'événements nombreux et que le corps vital de l'homme est puissant, une durée plus longue est donnée pour effectuer cette impression que lorsque le corps vital est faible, mais pendant tout ce temps , le corps dense reste relié aux véhicules supérieurs par la corde d'argent, et toute atteinte au corps physique est ressentie par l'esprit dans une certaine mesure .Ainsi, l'embaumement, l'autopsie, l'incinération, etc., sont ressentis. C'est pourquoi ces choses doivent être évitées pendant les trois jours et demi qui suivent immédiatement la mort. Lorsque le panorama a été entièrement gravé dans le corps du désir, la corde d'argent est rompue, le corps vital retourne vers le corps dense et il n'y a plus de connexion avec l'esprit, qui est alors libre de poursuivre sa vie dans les mondes spirituels.

Lorsque le corps dense est inhumé, le corps vital se désagrège lentement en même temps que le corps physique, et quand le bras, par exemple, pourrit dans ls terre, le bras éthérique du corps vital qui plane au-dessus de la tombe est détruit et disparaît, et il en est ainsi jusqu'à ce que rien ne reste plus du corps physique. Si on incinère ce dernier, le corps vital se désintègre immédiatement, et comme il renferme les images de la vie qui vient de prendre fin, images qui doivent être imprimées dans le corps du désir pour former la base de la vie au Purgatoire et au Premier Ciel, c'est une grande calamité d'incinérer le corps physique avant que les trois jours et demi soient écoulés. A moins qu'une aide ne soit donnée, jamais l'esprit ne pourrait rassembler ses souvenirs. Et c'est une partie du travail qui est effectué par les Aides Invisibles pour l'humanité. Parfois ils sont assistés dans cette tâche par les esprits de la nature et par d'autres entités envoyées par les Hiérarchies Créatrices ou par les guides de l'humanité. Il y a également une perte lorsque l'incinération est pratiquée avant que la corde d'argent n'ait été rompue naturellement, car alors l'impression dans le corps du désir n'est pas aussi profonde qu'elle l'aurait été autrement, et ceci a un effet sur les vies futures car, plus cette empreinte de la vie passée est profonde dans le corps du désir, plus aiguës sont les souffrances au Purgatoire pour le mal commis, et plus vives aussi les joies dans le Premier Ciel, qui résultent des bonnes actions de la vie passée. Ce sont ces souffrances et ces joies de nos vies passées qui créent ce que nous appelons la conscience, de sorte que si nous souffrons moins nous sommes aussi moins conscients de ce qui est faux et qui doit nous empêcher de continuer à commettre les mêmes erreurs, encore et encore, dans nos vies futures. C'est pourquoi les effets d'une incinération prématurée sont très néfastes. Il est navrant de devoir dire que si nous avons une science de la naissance, grâce à l'obstétrique, aux infirmières, à l'asepsie et à tout ce qui est nécessaire au comfort et au bien-être du nouveau-né, nous manquons malheureusement d'une science de la mort pour nous aider à assister les amis de toute une vie qui sont en train de nous quitter.

### <h3 id="question-54">Question 54</h3>

La perte de mémoire, causée par la fièvre ou par un choc nerveux, affecte-t-elle le corps vital d'une personne et l'empêche-t-elle de revoir l'enregistrement de sa vie dans les trois jours et demi qui suivent immédiatement sa mort?

RÉPONSE - Non. La mémoire est de trois sortes: il y a tout d'abord celle qui est élaborée par nos sens. Nous regardons autour de nous, nous voyons, nous entendons des choses; ces impressions sont gravées sur les cellules de notre cerveau, et nous pouvons consciemment les rappeler (pas toujours cependant), mais à un degré qui varie, car cette mémoire est extrêmement incertaine et capricieuse; et si cette dernière était la seule méthode d'obtenir l'enregistrement de nos vies, la loi de cause et d'effet serait invalidée et notre vie dans l'au-delà ne serait pas la conséquence de ce que nous avons fait ou laissé inachevé dans le passé.

Il doit y avoir une autre mémoire, et c'est ce que les scientifiques ont appelé l'intellect subconscient. De même que l'éther transmet à la caméra du photographe un enregistrement du paysage environnant et l'imprime sur le film photographique jusque dans ses plus infirmes détails, que le photographe ait ou non observés ceux-ci, ainsi ce même éther, qui transporte une image à notre oeil et l'imprime sur notre rétine, transporte dans nos poumons une image similaire qui est absorbée par le sang; et lorsque le sang passe à travers le coeur cet enregistrement est inscrit de manière indélébile sur l'atome-germe sensible qui est logé dens le ventricule gauche du coeur près de l'apex. Les forces de cet atome-germe sont emportées par l'Esprit, à la mort, et elles contiennent l'enregistrement de toute la vie dans ses moindres détails, et, que nous ayons observé les faits de certaines scènes ou non, ils sont néanmoins enregistrés.

George du Maurier a écrit livre intitulé "Peter Ibbetson" dans lequel cette théorie de la mémoire subconsciente est très clairement exposée. Peter Ibbetson, prisonnier dans un pénitencier anglais, a appris à "rêver vrai", c'est-à-dire qu'en plaçant son corps dans une certaine position, il a appris à bloquer en lui les courants d'éther, de manière à pouvoir, à volonté, entrer en contact avec n'importe quelle scène de sa vie écoulée; c'est ainsi que, tout adulte qu'il est, il devient le spectateur de sa propre vie d'enfant, auprès de ses parents et de ses camarades de jeux, et dans l'environnement dans lequel il se trouvait au moment où la scène s'est déroulée. Il revoit la scène complète avec beaucoup plus de détails qu'il n'avait pu en observer au moment où l'événement s'était déroulé dans le monde matériel. La raison tient à ce que dans ses rêves, il peut entrer en contact avec sa mémoire subconsciente. Il aurait été parfaitement incapable d'obtenir des renseignements concernant l'avenir, mais le passé, ayant été inscrit sur l'atome-germe de son coeur, lui était accessible dans des conditions appropriées. C'est de cette mémoire subconsciente qu'est tiré l'enregistrement de la vie, après la mort, et comme cette mémoire dépend uniquement de la respiration, elle continue à fonctionner indépendamment de toute autre circonstance, tant que le corps est en vie. Ainsi, bien qu'une personne puisse perdre sa mémoire consciente et soit incapable de se rappeler à volonté les événements passés, la mémoire subconsciente les contient tous et les cédera en temps voulu.

### <h3 id="question-55">Question 55</h3>

Si un esprit désincarné peut passer à travers un mur, peut-il aussi passer à travers une montagne et à travers la terre, et voir ce qu'il y a à l'intérieur?

RÉPONSE - Cela dépend du genre d'esprit désincarné que l'auteur de la question veut désigner. Lorsque quelqu'un meurt, il est en tous points tel qu'il était avant sa mort, sauf qu'il n'a plus de corps dense. Il lui est donc parfaitement possible de passer à travers un mur et à travers une montagne. Toutefois, il n'a pas le pouvoir de pénétrer dans la Terre.

C'est un fait très connu que bien que la plupart des clairvoyants et des médiums soient capables de nous dire bien des choses sur les spectacles et les scènes du Monde du Désir, il n'y a que très peu d'informations concernant l'intérieur de la Terre, car les clairvoyants déclarent que, s'ils essaient d'y pénétrer, ils éprouvent un heurt semblable à celui que ressent l'homme qui se jetterait contre un mur. C'est que la Terre est le corps d'un grand Esprit, et celui-ci ne peut être approché, en son intérieur, que par la voie de l'Initiation. Il y a neuf couches, d'épaisseur différente, autour du noyau terrestre, noyau qui en constitue la dixième partie, et les Mystères Mineurs sont la porte d'entrée qui donne accès à ce noyau central. Ils comprennent neuf degrés, et chaque degré franchi par le candidat lui permet de pénétrer la couche de la Terre qui y correspond. La dixième initiation appartient aux Mystères Majeurs qui comprennent quatre divisions. La première enseigne tout ce que l'homme est appelé à connaître pendant la Période de la Terre; la deuxième des Initiations Majeures enseigne tout ce qui sera acquis par l'humanité toute entière durant la Période de Jupiter; la troisième lui apporterait la sagesse qu'atteindra l'humanité à la fin de la Période de Vénus, et la quatrième terminerait son évolution dans ce grand Jour de Manifestation. L'initié aurait donc le niveau qu'aura atteint l'humanité à la fin de la Période de Vulcain. L'homme connaîtra alors tout ce que la Terre contiendra dans cette incarnation ci et dans ces manifestations futures. Les Mystères Mineurs lui auront aussi enseigné l'évolution qui fut la sienne durant les trois périodes antérieures à la présente Période de la Terre. Ce sont ces secrets qui sont enfermés dans la Terre, jusqu'à ce que l'homme ait lui-même ouvert la porte de la manière appropriée, et c'est pourquoi aucun Esprit, incarné ou désincarné, ne peut voir ce qui est à l'intérieur de la Terre, jusqu'à ce que la porte de l'Initiation ait ouvert ses facultés latentes.

### <h3 id="question-56">Question 56</h3>

Après la mort, retrouvons-nous ceux que nous avons aimés, même s'ils ont eu d'autres convictions que les nôtres? Ou, peut-être, s'ils ont été athées?

RÉPONSE - Oui, nous les retrouvons certainement, et nous les reconnaissons, car il n'y a pas de pouvoir de transformation dans la mort. De l'autre côté du voile, l'homme apparaît tel qu'il était ici-bas, car il pense qu'il a cette forme, mais le lieu où nous les rencontrons dépend, naturellement, de plusieurs facteurs.

Premièrement, si nous avons vécu une vie très pieuse, de telle sorte que nous ne séjournions pas du tout au Purgatoire, que nous n'ayions qu'un très court séjour au Premier Ciel, pour aller presque directement au Deuxième Ciel, il est évident que si l'être cher qui nous a quitté était d'une nature telle qu'il soit obligé de faire un long séjour dans le Monde du Désir, nous ne le rencontrerons pas avant qu'il ne soit arrivé au Deuxième Ciel. Si nous quittons ce monde peu après notre ami, la rencontre ne se fera peut-être pas avant une vingtaine d'années; même si c'était le cas, cela n'a aucune importance, car dans ces régions, on n'a aucune conscience du temps.

L'ami matérialiste, s'il a mené une bonne vie morale, ce qui est généralement le cas de ces personnes, demeurerait dans la quatrième région du Monde du Désir durant un certain nombre d'années, conformément à la durée de sa vie terrestre, et passerait ensuite au Deuxième Ciel où il n'aura pas une conscience aussi complète et parfaite que celle que possède une personne qui n'a cessé de mettre en relief les réalités de la vie.

Nous le verrons, le reconnaîtrons, collaborerons avec lui pendant des siècles au travail à faire sur notre milieu futur, et là, notre ami ne serait plus matérialiste du tout, car lorsque l'esprit atteint cette région élevée, il n'est plus sous l'effet des illusions qui l'enveloppent parfois dans ce monde matériel.Tout un chacun se reconnaît comme un être spirituel et ne songe à sa vie terrestre que comme à un mauvais rêve. L'esprit, en entrant dans ce monde s'éveille de toute manière à sa propre, vraie nature.

### <h3 id="question-57">Question 57</h3>

Reconnaisons-nous les personnes aimées qui sont passées par les portes de la mort?

RÉPONSE - Oui, certainement, nous les reconnaissons. Lorsqu'un homme quitte son corps physique, il demeure exactement ce qu'il était sur la terre. Il n'y a aucune différence si ce n'est qu'il ne possède plus de corps physique; il se voit lui-même dans le Monde du Désir, et comme il garde dans sa conscience l'image de ce qu'il était ici-bas, le corps du désir prend immédiatement la forme du corps physique, si bien que quiconque l'aura connu dans sa vie terrestre le reconnaîtra dans l'au-delà. En outre il peut être utile d'ajouter qu'il n'y a pas de pouvoir transformateur dans la mort, que mentalement et moralement, l'homme reste lui-même. On entend souvent des gens qui ont aimé quelqu'un, parler du cher ange disparu, alors qu'ils admettent qu'ici -bas, il était plutôt un démon, mais ils pensent habituellement qu'il serait irrévérencieux de parler autrement de lui maintenant qu'il est trépassé. Néanmoins, seuls ceux qui ont été bons sur terre sont bons dans le ciel.

### <h3 id="question-58">Question 58</h3>

Le suicidé reste-t-il plus longtemps au Purgatoire que ceux qui sont décédés de mort naturelle?

RÉPONSE - Lorsque l'Ego vient pour renaître, il descend à travers le Deuxième Ciel où, avec l'aide des Hiérarchies Créatrices, il construit l'archétype de son corps futur, et il y instille une vie qui durera un certain nombre d'années. Ces archétypes sont des espaces creux et ils ont un mouvement vibratoire mélodieux qui attire en eux la matière du Monde Physique et qui dispose les atomes dans le corps dense, de manière à les faire vibrer à l'unisson d'un petit atome logé dans le coeur, l'atome-germe qui, tel un diapason, donne le ton à toute la matière du corps physique. Quand la vie de ce corps physique est arrivée à son terme ici-bas, les vibrations cessent dans l'archétypes, l'atome-germe est retiré, le corps physique se désagrège, et le corps du désir, dont l'Ego se sert pendant son séjour au Purgatoire et au Premier Ciel, prend l'aspect du corps physique. L'homme commence alors son travail d'après-vie: l'expiation des mauvaises habitudes au Purgatoire et l'assimilation, au Premier Ciel, du bien qu'il a fait durant la vie terreste.

Ce qui précède est la description des conditions normales, lorsque l'ordre de la nature a suivi son cours, mais le cas du suicidé est différent. Il a emporté l'atome-germe, mais l'archétype creux continue encore à vibrer. C'est pourquoi le suicidé se sent comme évidé, et il éprouve un sentiment de tiraillement intérieur comparable aux affres d'une faim intense. La matière pour la construction d'un corps physique l'entoure de toutes parts, mais comme il lui manque le calibre de l'atome-germe, il lui est impossible d'assimiler cette matière et de s'en construire un corps. Cet affreux sentiment de vide dure aussi longtemps que sa vie ordinaire aurait duré. Ainsi, la loi de cause à effet lui enseigne qu'il est mal de déserter l'école de la vie et que nul ne peut le faire impunément. Dans la prochaine vie, quand les difficultés se présenteront sur son chemin, il se rappellera les souffrances que lui ont valu son suicide et il ira jusqu'au bout de l'expérience qui favorise sa croissance de l'âme.

### <h3 id="question-59">Question 59</h3>

Un homme bon doit-il nécessairement passer par le Purgatoire pour y prendre conscience de tout le mal qui y règne, avant de pouvoir gagner le Premier, le Deuxième et le Troisième Ciel? S'il en est ainsi, n'est-ce pas là, pour lui, un châtiment immérité?

RÉPONSE - L'auteur de cette question devrait se défaire de l'idée de châtiment. Il n'existe pas de châtiment. Tout ce qui arrive à un homme est la conséquence de lois immuables qui ne varient pas, et il n'y a pas deDieu personnel qui donne des récompenses ou des châtiments selon une volonté insondable ou suivvant tout autre méhode. Que l'Ego se vête de ses véhicules ou qu'il s'en dévête, cela se fait exactement sur le même principe et selon les mêmes lois qui gouvernent, par exemple dans le cas d'une planète. Lorsqu'une planète se forme, à partir du brouillard de feu central, une cristallisation a eu lieu aux pôles, où le mouvement est le plus lent. La matière cristallisée est rejetée à l'extérieur par la force centrifuge et elle flotte dans l'espace, parce qu'elle est plus lourde que le reste du brouillard de feu. Pour des raisons similaires, lorsque le corps le plus dense de l'esprit s'est cristallisé et alourdi à tel point que l'esprit ne peut plus l'utiliser pour acquérir de l'expérience, un processus d'enlèvement des véhicules est accompli par la force centrifuge qui, naturellement, élimine d'abord le corps physique. C'est cela que nous nommons la mort. L'esprit est alors libre pendant un certain temps, mais la substance-désir la plus grossière qui était l'incarnation de nos passions et de nos désirs les plus bas, doit aussi être rejetée, et c'est l'éjection forcée des désirs inférieurs qui cause la souffrance au Purgatoire où la force de répulsion est la plus forte. Si un homme a une certaine quantité de cette matière grossière dans son corps du désir, il devra naturellement séjourner au Purgatoire et passer par le processus d'épuration avant de pouvoir entrer au Premier Ciel. Ici, la force centripète d'attraction attire en tourbillons tout le bien de la vie, à l'intérieur vers le centre spirituel, où il est assimilé en tant que pouvoir de l'âme, disponible pour être utilisé par l'Esprit en tant que conscience dans sa prochaine vie terrestre. Ainsi la durée de notre existence au Purgatoire dépend de la quantité de matière grossière contenue dans notre corps du désir, et un homme bon n'aurait naturellement que très peu de matière de cette sorte ou pas du tout. C'est pourquoi il ne ferait au Purgatoire pas de séjour valant la peine d'être mentionné et passerait à travers ces régions directement au Premier Ciel.

### <h3 id="question-60">Question 60</h3>

Quelle est la situation dans l'au-delà de la victime d'un meurtre et de la victime d'un accident mortel?

RÉPONSE - Il n'y a rien qui puisse être appelé accident, du moins lorsque l'accident a une issue fatale. La durée de la vie de chacun est ordinairement arrêtée avant la naissance, mais à certains moments de la vie, les chemins bifurquent pour ainsi dire, et certaines occasions de croissance sont placées devant la personne, que celle-ci peut saisir ou laisser passer. Si la personne néglige d'utiliser ses occasions, la vie aboutit pour ainsi dire à une impasse et se termine peu après.

Cela n'est cependant pas le cas dans un accident, mais il peut y avoir certaines raisons pour lesquelles il est opportun que la personne soit chassée de son corps d'une manière violente. Elle se trouve alors dans la même situation que ceux qui sont morts d'une mort ordinaire, et elle commence aussitôt son existence au Purgatoire.

Le cas de la victime d'un meurtre, comme le cas du suicide, est différent. L'homme, du fait de sa nature divine, est le seul être qui ait la prérogative de causer du désordre dans le plan de son développement, et de même qu'il peut terminer sa vie par un acte de volonté, il peut aussi mettre un terme à la vie d'autrui, avant que l'heure en ait sonné. Les souffrances d'un homme assassiné devraient être les mêmes que celles d'un suicidé, car l'archétype de son corps continue ses efforts pour attirer à lui une matière qu'il lui est devenu impossible d'assimiler; mais dans ce cas, l'intervention d'autres facteurs empêche la souffrance, et la victime d'un meurtre flotte ça et là dans son corps du désir, dans un état comateux, pendant tout le temps qu'elle aurait eu encore à vivre. Si l'assassin est saisi par la justice et subit la peine de mort, l'attraction magnétique l'attirera vers sa victime, qui restera ainsi constamment sous ses yeux, et c'est vraiment un châtiment autrement sévère pour lui que tous ceux que nous pourrions lui infliger; mais pendant ce temps, la victime ignore la présence de son meurtrier.

### <h3 id="question-61">Question 61</h3>

Où est le ciel?

RÉPONSE - Le Christ a dit, "Le Ciel est en vous", et cependant nous apprenons qu'au moment où Il quitta Ses disciples, Il est monté au Ciel. Pour comprendre cela, nous devons analyser la constitution d'une planète, et conformément à l'axiome d'Hermès, "Ce qui est en bas est comme ce qui est en haut", notre compréhension sera meilleure si nous commençons par analyser la constitution de l'homme.

L'homme possède premièrement un corps dense que nous voyons de nos yeux, mais ce corps physique n'est pas aussi solide qu'il paraît; en fait, il est interpénétré de plusieurs véhiucles invisibles. Il est composé de solides, de liquides et de gaz de la région chimique qui, selon ce que nous dit la science, sont interpénétrés par l'éther, car le corps humain n'est pas autrement constitué que toutes les choses faisant partie de l'univers, et dans le solide le plus dense, comme dans le gaz le plus raréfié, la science dit, et dit en vérité, que chaque petit atome vibre dans un océan d'éther. Cet éther est encore de la matière physique; l'homme en spécialise une quantité considérable pour former un corps qui est l'exacte contrepartie de son corps dense, qu'il dépasse sur toute sa périphérie de quatre centimètres environ. C'est ce même corps éthérique que les docteurs de Boston ont pesé en plaçant des mourants sur une balance. Ils ont remarqué qu'au moment du dernier soupir, une matière pondérable quittait le corps des mourants, car le côté de la balance où étaient placés les poids tombait avec une soudaineté surprenante. Les correspondants des journaux ont prétendu que ces médecins avait pesé l'âme, mais ce qui avait été pesé, en réalité, était le corps vital composé d'éther et qui, à la mort, quitte le corps physique.

Nous possédons un corps plus subtil encore, le corps du désir qui est composé de ce que les occultistes appellent la substance-désir et qui peut être vu, par ceux qui sont doués du sixième sens, sous la forme d'un nuage ovoïde enveloppant le corps dense qui y occupe la place du jaune dans l'oeuf, avec cette seule différence que, tandis que le blanc de l'oeuf enveloppe le jaune sans le pénétrer, le corps du désir interpénètre à la fois le corps vital et le corps dense dans leurs moindres recoins . Il entre une matière encore plus subtile dans la constitution de l'homme, que nous pouvons appeler "substance- mentale" et qui se compose de la matière la plus grossière du monde de la pensée, matière dans laquelle nous formons nos pensées concrètes et qui enveloppe l'Ego intérieur.

Le monde est semblablement constitué. En plus du monde visible que nous voyons, composé de solides, de liquides et de gaz et interpénétré par l'éther, il y a encore un Monde du désir qui pénètre chaque partie du Monde Physique et qui s'étend dans l'espace, au-delà de l'air et de l'éther. Puis, il y a le Monde de la Pensée qui interpénètre chaque partie de notre planète, du centre à la périphérie et qui s'étend dans l'espace encore au-delà de tous les autres mondes.

Pendant son existence terrestre, l'homme vit sur ce globe ferme et visible, mais après la mort, selon les actions accomplies dans le corps, il pourra rester emprisonné ici-bas, car les régions du Purgatoire nous entourent de toutes parts et se trouvent également dans tous les recoins intérieurs de la Terre. Le Premier Ciel est aussi ici-bas, en un certain sens, étant donné que la substance dont il est formé est tout autour de nous, mais le Premier Ciel lui-même, qui est le lieu où demeurent habituellement les esprits qui ont été libérés, est au-delà de notre atmosphère. On peut dire avec raison que le Deuxième Ciel est également au-dedans de nous, car la substance qui le constitue se trouve ici-bas, et les esprits qui l'habitent peuvent nous visiter; toutefois, les conditions terrestres, les courants de pensées qui circulent ici entraveraient leur travail et leur développement. C'est pourquoi ils préfèrent rester dans la partie la plus éloignée et la plus écartée de notre planète, où la pure substance mentale n'est pas souillée par les courants égoïstes et délétères de nos pen sées.

Le Troisième Ciel est un endroit où très peu de personnes sont conscientes à notre degré actuel de développement, parce que nous sommes, pour la plupart, guidés dans nos activités mentales, plus par nos émotions et nos sentiments concernant les choses concrètes, que par la pensée abstraite qui est la faculté appartenant en propre au Troisième Ciel. Lorsque nous pensons à l'amour, nous y pensons habituellement par rapport à une personne précise; il s'agit là d'une pensée concrète. Mais bien peu d'entre nous peuvent penser à l'Amour d'une manière abstraite. Nous pensons à une maison, à un animal, etc., toutes choses concrètes, mais nous n'aimons pas penser à une proposition abstraite telle que, le carré de l'hypoténuse est égal à la somme des carrés des deux autres côtés d'un triangle. C'est pourquoi la plupart d'entre nous n'ont que très peu de conscience dans le Troisième Ciel, et conséquemment il entre très peu de la substance de la région de la pensée abstraite dans la constitution de notre planète.

### <h3 id="question-62">Question 62</h3>

On dit qu'il n'y a pas de douleur au ciel, mais si les êtres chers que nous y rencontrons doivent nous devancer, la séparation n'implique- t-elle pas au moins un sentiment de regret?

RÉPONSE - Non, car là, nous voyons les choses telles qu'elles sont. Ici-bas nous sommes aveugles. Lorsque l'Ego entre dans le Monde Physique, c'est en un certain sens une cause de réjouissance, puisque nous nous réjouissons à la naissance d'un enfant, car ce monde nous fournit l'expérience et la matière pour la croissance de l'âme. Mais d'un autre point de vue, lorsque l'Ego vient dans ce monde et entre dans la prison du corps physique, il se trouve dans la condition la plus limitée qu'on puisse imaginer, aussi, se réjouir au moment de la naissance d'un enfant et se lamenter lorsqu'il est libéré par la mort, est en réalitlé analogue à se réjouir lorsqu'un ami est mis en prison et donner libre cours à des lamentations hystériques lorsqu'il en est libéré.

Quand l'esprit passe dans le Monde Céleste, il rencontre au Premier Ciel bon nombre de ceux qu'il a fréquentés sur terre, mais là il s'est déjà tellement spiritualisé et il est en contact si étroit avec les réalités qu'il sait qu'il n'y a pas de mort. Aussi, lorsqu'un être qui lui est cher passe plus loin, cet avancement est une réjouissance et une joie; et la certitude de le revoir enlève certainement tout serrement de coeur chez ceux qui sont restés en arrière.

### <h3 id="question-63">Question 63</h3>

Expliquez s'il vous plaît comment se concentrer pour aider ceux qui sont dans l'autre monde. Voulez-vous dire qu'il faut s'asseoir en silence et leur envoyer des pensées d'amour et d'aide?

RÉPONSE - La capacité d'envoyer une pensée et le pouvoir qu'a cette pensée de réaliser le but vers lequel elle a été envoyée dépendent de la précision avec laquelle le penseur est capable de visualiser ce qu'il désire accomplir. Et les écoles d'occultisme habituelles, en particulier celles qui suivent la ligne de pensée de l'Orient, conseillent la méthode de concentration par laquelle les pensées sont centrées sur un seul point, comme les rayons du Soleil sur le foyer d'une lentille, car ainsi leurs forces s'additionnent, et de même que les rayons du Soleil provoquent une combustion lorsqu'on les fait converger, ainsi la pensée réalisera invariablement son but lorsqu'elle est concentrée avec une intensité suffisante.

Il faut une longue pratique, cependant, pour apprendre à faire cela, et il y a bien peu d'Occidentaux capables de diriger ainsi leurs pensées vers un but. La religion de l'Occident, reconnaissant cette incapacité, enseigne une autre méthode bien plus efficace que la concentration, c'est-à-dire la prière.

Donc si nous voulons aider ceux qui sont passés dans l'autre monde, nous pouvons prier avec ferveur pour leur bien-être, et pour qu'ils apprennent les leçons de cette vie complètement durant leurs expériences au Purgatoire et au Premier Ciel; alors nous accomplirons beaucoup plus en leur faveur que si nous essayons la froide méthode intellectuelle de concentration. L'attitude du corps ajoute quelquefois beaucoup à l'intensité de la prière, et si la position agenouillée semble faciliter la prière, il faut la prendre. D'autre part, comme l'a dit Emerson:

```
"Et bien que vos genoux ne soient jamais pliés, 
Vers les Cieux, chaque heure, s'élèvent vos prières; 
Et qu'elles soient faites pour le bien ou pour le mal, 
Elles sont enregistrées et reçoivent une Réponse,"
```

Par conséquent, la position du corps n'a d'importance que si elle concourt à l'intensité de la prière, car c'est l'intensité qui rend la prière efficace.

### <h3 id="question-64">Question 64</h3>

Ceux qui ont quitté cette vie veillent-ils sur nous qui sommes laissés en arrière; par exemple, les mères veillent-elles sur leurs petits enfants et même sur les plus grands?

RÉPONSE - Oui; très souvent une mère qui vient de mourir veillera encore longtemps sur ses petits enfants, et on a enregistré des cas de mères ayant sauvé leurs enfants en danger. Bien que ne sachant pas consciemment comment se matérialiser, leur amour pour leurs enfants et le désir ardent qu'elles avaient de les sauvegarder, leur ont permis d'attirer assez de matière pour se rendre visibles aux yeux de leurs petits. Ceux que nous appelons les morts ne s'éloignent, le plus souvent, de la maison où ils ont vécu, que longtemps après leurs funérailles. Ils se tiennent dans les chambres familières, et, quoique invisibles à nos yeux, se meuvent parmi nous. Bien entendu, lorsque vient pour eux le moment de passer dans le Premier Ciel, ils ne restent plus dans nos maisons, mais ils viennent souvent y faire des visites. Lorsqu'en temps voulu ils passent dans le Deuxième Ciel, ils ne sont plus conscients de cette sphère physique dans le sens d'y posséder un foyer, des amis ou des parents; il convient plutôt de les considérer comme des forces de la nature, car ils travaillent alors sur la Terre et sur l'être humain à la manière de ces forces qui ne prennent pas la forme humaine.

Il est donc parfaitement vrai qu'ils veillent sur leurs bien-aimés longtemps après avoir quitté la Terre. Et il n'est pas rare que des personnes ayant assisté aux derniers instants d'une mère, l'aient entendue s'exclamer en s'adressant à ses enfants qu'elle avait perdus et qu'elle seule pouvait voir, "Tiens! C'est Jeannot! Comme il a grandi". Les témoins de telles scènes pensent peut-être à une hallucination, mais ce n'en est pas une, et il faut remarquer qu'un phénomène précis accompagne toujours ces visions, à savoir que lorsqu'une personne est sur le point de mourir, elle sent descendre sur elle une obscurité. Ce changement est dû au passage de nos vibrations lumineuses aux vibrations du Monde du désir, et cela est semblable aux ténèbres qui couvrirent la Terre au moment de la crucifixion du Christ. Pour quelques-uns, cette obscurité persiste jusqu'à ce qu'ils aient rendu le dernier soupir. Il en est d'autres pour qui cette obscurité se lève après un moment et alors le mourant est clairvoyant, et il voit à la fois le Monde Physique et le Monde du Désir. Dans ce dernier lui apparaissent les êtres aimés qui sont déjà passés dans l'au-delà, et qui ont été attirés par sa mort imminente qui est une naissance dans leur monde.

Aussi, nous pouvons dire que nos bien-aimés s'intéressent à notre bien-être longtemps encore après leur passage dans l'au-delà, mais il faut se rappeler qu'il n'y a dans la mort aucun pouvoir transformateur; la mort ne donne à ceux qui nous ont quitté aucune capacité spéciale pour prendre soin de nous, et ils n'ont aucun moyen d'influencer réellement nos affaires, en sorte qu'il n'est pas très juste de les considérer comme nos anges gardiens. Ils sont simplement des spectateurs intéressés, sauf dans quelques cas spécifiques où une intense affection les rend capables de rendre un petit service en cas de besoin extrême. Cependant ce service ne prendrait jamais, pour nous, la forme d'un enrichissement ou de quelque autre chose du même ordre, mais serait plutôt de nature à nous avertir d'un danger ou autre fait similaire. 

<h2 id="section-3">Partie 6 - Questions Concernant la Renaissance</h2>

### <h3 id="question-65">Question 65</h3>

Pourquoi, à peu d'exceptions près, renaissons-nous sans la moindre connaissance de l'une quelconque de nos existences passées, et pourquoi souffrons-nous dans la vie présente pour des transgressions commises dans des vies précédentes dont nous sommes totalement ignorants? Ne pourrions- nous pas avancer spirituellement mieux et plus vite si nous savions où nous nous sommes trompés antérieurement, et quelles façons d'agir nous devons corriger, avant de pouvoir progresser?

RÉPONSE - C'est une des plus grandes bénédictions accordées à l'homme que de ne pas connaître ses expériences antérieures tant qu'il n'est pas considérablement avancé spirituellement, car il y a dans nos vies passées (lorsque nous étions beaucoup plus ignorants que nous le sommes maintenant) des actes très graves qui demandent rétribution; et cette destinée est en train d'être graduellement liquidée, de sorte que si si nous connaissions nos vies passées, si nous savions quand et comment la loi de cause à effet nous apportera la rétribution de nos méfaits passés, nous verrions cette calamité imminente suspendue au-dessus de nous, et la peur de notre destinée tendrait à nous enlever la force de lutter contre elle; et lorsqu'elle se manifesterait nous nous trouverions devant elle épouvantés et réduits à l'impuissance.

D'autre part, ignorants ce qu'il y a derrière nous, nous échappons à la connaissance de ce qui est devant nous, et en conséquence, nous apprenons les leçons sans être paralysés par la crainte. En outre, pour ceux qui désirent savoir, il y a certains moyens de connaître quelles leçons nous avons à apprendre, et quelle est la meilleure façon de les apprendre. Par exemple, notre consciense nous dit ce que nous devons faire ou ne pas faire. Si nous prenons la peine d'étudier la science de l'astrologie, l'horoscope nous révèle nos tendances ainsi que les lignes de moindre résistance, de sorte qu'en travaillant avec ces lois de la nature nous puissions avancer rapidement; et mieux nous suivons les commandements de notre conscience, mieux nous étudions les lois de la nature révélées par l'astronomie, plus rapidement nous serons prêts pour la connaissance directe.

Dans "Zanoni", Bulwer Lytton parle d'un spectre terrible que Glyndon rencontra lorsqu'il essaya de franchir un degré d'avancement qu'il n'avait pas encore atteint; et ce spectre s'appelle en occultisme le "Gardien du Seuil". Entre le moment de la mort et une nouvelle naissance, ce Gardien du Seuil n'est pas vu par l'homme; il est l'incarnation de toutes nos mauvaises actions écoulées, et il doit être dépassé par celui qui désire entrer consciemment dans les mondes intérieurs pour atteindre à la pleine connaissance des conditions qui y règnent; il y a cependant un autre Gardien qui personnifie toutes nos bonnes actions, et c'est lui que nous pourrions appeler notre Ange Gardien.

Si nous avons le courage de dépasser le gardien hideux que nous apercevons en premier lieu, car il est formé de substance-désir grossière, nous obtiendrons bientôt l'aide consciente de l'autre, et nous aurons alors la force de faire face, sans crainte, à l'avalanche de dénigrements auxquels sont exposés ceux qui essaient de fouler le sentier du désintéressement. Mais tant que nous n'avons pas dépassé ce spectre, nous ne sommes pas aptes à connaître nos vies antérieures; nous devons nous contenter de la vue ordinaire donnée à l'humanité.

### <h3 id="question-66">Question 66</h3>

Les humains qui peuplent la terre à l'époque actuelle sont-ils tous des âmes déjà venues sur terre auparavant, ou bien y a-t-il toujours de nouvelles âmes créées?

RÉPONSE - La pénétration des esprits dans les corps humains, tels qu'ils sont actuellement constitués, a commencé lors de la phase de solidification de notre terre connue sous le nom d'Epoque Lémurienne, et s'est terminée vers le milieu de l'Epoque Atlantéenne, laps de temps qui représente peut-être des millions d'années. Mais depuis lors, il n'y a pas eu d'autre pénétration; la porte est définitivement close, parce que nous sommes arrivés à un degré d'évolution tel que ceux qui n'avaient pas atteint, à ce moment, le stade où ils pouvaient manipuler un corps humain, sont trop loin derrière nous pour rattrapper notre futur développement. Depuis cette époque, les esprits qui s'étaient incarnés dans des formes humaines ont évolué à travers des existences répétées, en sorte que, sans exception, chaque membre de notre humanité s'est incarné à différentes époques et dans de milieux divers.

### <h3 id="question-67">Question 67</h3>

Comment savons-nous, sans doute possible, que la renaissance est un fait? Se peut-il que ceux qui la professent soient l'objet d'une hallucination?

RÉPONSE - Le clairvoyant exercé qui est capable de lire dans la Mémoire de la Nature peut suivre la vie des gens en remontant depuis leur état présent en arrière , jusque dans les années de leur enfance. Il les voit dans leur première enfance, peut les suivre pendant la période de gestation jusqu'au moment où l'esprit est entré dans la matrice de la mère. Il peut remonter à travers leur vie dans les mondes célestes, leur vie au Purgatoire, arriver au moment de la mort dans leur précédente vie, puis en remontant toujours voir leur vie entière. Mais dans le cas d'un adulte, l'intervalle de temps est généralement d'un millier d'années ou davantage, et il est naturellement possible, s'il n'y avait pas d'autre moyen de vérification, que cela puisse être une hallucination. Cependant, dans le cas d'enfants qui n'ont pas atteint la puberté, l'espace de temps entre deux incarnations est relativement court. Il est donc facile de vérifier une renaissance parmi nos propres connaissances, et ceci est, en fait, une partie de l'instruction que reçoit un élève des Frères Aînés. On lui montre un enfant sur le point de mourir, et on lui dit de le surveiller dans les mondes invisibles pendant un ou deux ans peut-être, de le suivre pas à pas jusqu'à ce qu'il renaisse, ce qui peut se produire avec les mêmes parents ou avec d'autres. Lorsque l'élève a ainsi suivi un Ego à travers les mondes invisibles, de la mort à une nouvelle naissance, il sait d'une façon certaine que la loi de renaissance est un fait dans la nature, et il a souvent l'occasion, au cours d'autres investigations, de poursuivre des études sur les vies antérieures de nombreux individus.

Mais, nous dira-t-on, cette clairvoyance dont il est parlé comme moyen d'investigation, n'est-elle pas en elle-même une hallucination? Le chercheur, bien que parfaitement honnête, ne peut-il être victime d'une vision chimérique? On peut affirmer en réponse à cette suggestion que le clairvoyant a tous les jours, à sa disposition, le moyen de vérifier ses observations. Lorsqu'un homme a visité la ville de New York et qu'il a vu la ville il ne sera jamais tenté de dire, "Je me demande si je ne me suis pas trompé"? Il y est allé et il le sait. Ainsi en est-il du clairvoyant. Quand il quitte son corps dense, il rencontre des gens que, dans la vie ordinaire, il ne connaît pas, et il travaille avec eux. Plus tard, il peut être invité à rendre visite à ces amis du monde invisible; il peut, sous leur conduite clairvoyante, se rendre dans une ville qui lui est étrangère, les trouver dans la rue et dans la maison qu'il a vues grâce à la clairvoyance, les reconnaître et être reconnu. Il peut converser avec ces amis des choses qu'ils ont faites ensemble, des endroits qu'ils ont visités dans leur corps invisible, et s'il avait jamais eu quelque doute au sujet de la réalité de sa vie en dehors du monde physique dense, il est dès lors définitivement convaincu de la réalité de ses expériences en dehors de son corps. Il sait qu'elles ne sont pas étranges, il sait qu'il n'a pas été illusionné, mais que sa vie, son travail et ses expériences dans les mondes invisibles sont aussi réels que sa vie, son travail et ses expériences ici-bas.

### <h3 id="question-68">Question 68</h3>

Les âmes qui ont passé par le Purgatoire et les Premier, Deuxième et Troisième Ciels renaissent-elles sur cette terre ou vont-elles sur d'autres sphères?

RÉPONSE - Elles reviennent sur la Terre jusqu'à ce qu'elles aient appris toutes les leçons qui peuvent être apprises ici-bas. Le même principe est employé lorsque nous envoyons nos enfants à l'école. Nous ne mettons pas un enfant à l'école maternelle un jour, à l'école primaire le lendemain et à l'école secondaire le troisième, mais nous l'envoyons à l'école maternelle jour après jour jusqu'à ce qu'il ait appris toutes les leçons qui doivent y être apprises. Les connaissances qu'il y a acquises forment la base de ce qui doit être appris à l'école primaire; l'instruction acquise à l'école primaire sera la base de celle de l'école secondaire, et ainsi de suite. Selon le même processus, nous avons appris des leçons dans le passé, dans différentes conditions, et à l'avenir, lorsque nous aurons appris tout ce que nous pouvons apprendre dans notre milieu terrestre actuel, nous trouverons aussi en réserve pour nous des tâches convenant à une évolution plus avancée. Le progrès est sans fin, car nous sommes divins comme notre Père céleste, et il n'y a pas de limites.

### <h3 id="question-69">Question 69</h3>

Sommes-nous en contact avec les amis d'une vie antérieure lorsque nous renaissons à une vie terrestre nouvelle?

RÉPONSE - La loi de renaissance a pour compagne celle de cause à effet. Il est évident qu'il y a de nombreuses causes mises en oeuvre par nous tous, qui n'ont pas d'effets dans cette vie-ci. Par exemple un homme est malade et sa femme se dévoue pour lui jusqu'au sacrifice. Il y a assurément là une dette à payer, et si la maladie n'a de cesse qu'à la mort du mari, il n'y a dans cette vie-ci aucune occasion de rendre cette faveur. Connaissant les lois de la nature et la manière dont elles opèrent, nous savons qu'elles ne sont pas infirmées par d'aussi minces raisons que la cessation de la vie dans un certain corps. Si nous nous cassons un membre, il n'est pas guéri le lendemain, bien que nous puissions avoir dormi la nuit, inconscients de notre fracture; mais quand nous nous réveillons, le membre est à peu près dans le même état où il était le jour précédent. Ainsi en est-il des actions accomplies dans le corps au cours d'une vie. Bien que nous ayons traversé l'existence qui sépare la mort d'une nouvelle naissance, et que nous soyons inconscients de nos vies antérieures, lorsque nous commençons une nouvelle vie, la loi d'association, les causes générées dans une vie précédente, nous amènent dans un nouveau milieu où nous trouvons nos anciens amis et nos anciens ennemis. Nous les connaissons aussi, bien que, peut-être, nous ne les reconnaissions pas directement. Parfois, nous rencontrons une personne pour la première fois et sommes attirés vers elle; nous avons le sentiment que nous l'avons connue dans toutes nos vies et que nous pourrions lui confier notre personne et tout ce que nous avons. Cela vient de ce que l'esprit intérieur voit et reconnaît un vieil ami, bien qu'il lui soit impossible d'imprimer cette ressouvenance sur le cerveau qu'il possède maintenant. Il se peut aussi que nous rencontrions une personne dont la compagnie ne nous plaît pas; instinctivement, nous éprouvons pour elle un sentiment d'antipathie, qu'aucune raison apparente ne justifie; là aussi, c'est l'esprit intérieur qui reconnaît et voit en elle l'ennemi d'une existence passée. Ainsi, nos sympathies et antipathies instinctives sont des indications dictées par des expériences antérieures et, à la lumière des expériences ultérieures on remarque qu'on peut habituellement s'y fier.

### <h3 id="question-70">Question 70</h3>

L'expérience acquise dans chaque incarnation est-elle enregistrée séparément et ajoutée aux précédentes, si bien qu'à la fin, l'esprit sera entièrement conscient de la totalité de ses expériences, ou bien l'expérience d'une vie est-elle plus ou moins inconsciemment absorbée par l'incarnation suivante, de telle sorte qu'il n'y ait qu'un effet général obtenu?

RÉPONSE - Etant enfants, nous avons appris à écrire et nous avons fait de nombreux gestes maladroits avant d'avoir finalement cultivé la faculté. Les années ont passé et nous avons tout oublié des expériences faites durant cet apprentissage, mais notre faculté est disponible pour notre usage quel que soit le moment où elle est requise.

De même, les expériences par lesquelles nous avons passé dans nos différentes vies sont généralement oubliées, mais les facultés cultivées demeurent et nous pouvons les utiliser n'importe quand. Il arrive parfois qu'une personne n'ayant jamais pris une leçon de peinture n'en soit pas moins artiste jusqu'au bout des doigts, capable d'exécuter les plus merveilleux tableaux. C'est qu'elle a apporté de ses vies passées la faculté qu'elle est capable d'utiliser maintenant. Le cas de Mozart composant à l'âge de trois ans est un exemple prouvant que le sens de l'harmonie a été longuement cultivé chez lui dans le passé. On peut donc dire que, bien que nous n'en ayons pas gardé le souvenir, les facultés cultivées dans des existences antérieures nous restent acquises pour en faire usage dans la vie présente. C'est ce qui fait la différence entre un homme et un autre, entre l'ignorant et le sage.

Il y a cependant dans la nature un enregistrement de nos vies passées, qui est fait dans les moindres détails. Le clairvoyant exercé, capable de lire dans la Mémoire de la Nature, peut suivre en sens inverse les vies passées d'un homme, comme, par exemple, le film d'un cinéma qui se déroulerait en sens inverse. Il voit d'abord la vie actuelle de l'homme, puis sa naissance, le précédent séjour dans le monde invisible, ensuite la mort de l'existence précédente qui, à son tour, se déroule en sens inverse, de la vieillesse à l'âge mûr, à la jeunesse, à l'enfance, jusqu'à la naissance, et ainsi de suite à travers ses diverses vies.

### <h3 id="question-71">Question 71</h3>

Lorsque l'esprit en voie de renaître a attiré à lui la substance mentale nécessaire, et qu'il s'enfonce dans le Monde du Désir, ne passe-t-il pas de nouveau par le Purgatoire ?

RÉPONSE - Ce qui embarrasse l'auteur de cette question est qu'il n'a pas bien compris ce qui constitue le Purgatoire. Le Purgatoire se trouve dans les régions inférieures du Monde du Désir, mais ces régions ne sont pas un Purgatoire pour ceux qui n'ont rien à expurger. Les désirs inférieurs de l'homme sont formés de la matière-désir de cette région, et comme il ne peuvent plus être satisfaits, l'homme en souffre. En outre, la force de répulsion y est toute-puissance, et lorsque l'Ego passe dans l'au-delà, il a, gravées dans son corps du désir, les images des mauvaises actions qu'il a commises. Ces images sont formées de substance-désir grossière, parce qu'elles sont générées par les passions de l'homme au moment où il a commis les actions qu'elles représentent, et la force centrifuge de répulsion cherche à les éliminer de son être. C'est le fait de les arracher qui cause la souffrance qu'il ressent. Mais lorsque l'Ego traverse à nouveau cette région pour renaître, la force centripète d'attraction attire à lui une nouvelle substance-désir. Ce n'est donc pas du tout le Purgatoire; ce n'est pas non plus le Purgatoire pour les Aides Invisibles qui vont parmi les esprits emprisonnés, afin d'essayer de les aider à apprendre les leçons qui feront d'eux de meilleurs hommes et de meilleures femmes. Ce n'est que là où le mal doit être expurgé par l'esprit que celui-ci ressent cette région comme étant un lieu de purification.

### <h3 id="question-72">Question 72</h3>

Comment pouvez-vous croire à la théorie de la réincarnation qui veut que nous revenions ici dans le corps d'un animal? N'est-il pas beaucoup plus beau de croire en la doctrine Chrétienne qui enseigne que nous allons au ciel avec Dieu et les Anges?

RÉPONSE - L'auteur n'a jamais soutenu la théorie que lui prête la personne qui pose la question, qui, de toute évidence, n'a pas du tout étudié le sujet. Il existe chez les tribus les plus ignorantes de l'Orient une doctrine qui enseigne la théorie de la transmigration des âmes, c'est-à-dire que l'esprit humain peut s'incarner dans le corps des animaux, mais cette théorie est bien différente de celle de la renaissance, selon laquelle l'homme est un être en évolution, progressant à l'école de la vie, grâce à des renaissances successives, dans des corps de texture de plus en plus perfectionnée. Le Christ a dit à Ses disciples, "Soyez parfaits comme votre Père céleste est parfait". C'est là un commandement bien précis, et le Christ ne l'aurait pas donné s'il avait été irréalisable. Mais nous savons aussi que nous ne pouvons atteindre ce but en une seule vie. Cependant, grâce au temps qui nous est donné et aux occasions qui nous sont présentées par nos renaissances répétées et les milieux différents, nous accompli rons en temps voulu cette oeuvre de perfectionnement de nous-mêmes.

Il n'y a, dans tous les écrits sacrés d'Orient, aucune autorité qui permette de croire à la métempsychose. Le seul point de ressemblance avec une telle idée se trouve dans le Katopanishad, Chapitre 5, Verset 9, où il est dit que certaines âmes, conformément à leurs actions, renaîtront, mais que d'autres entreront dans la sphère d'immobilité. Cela signifie, selon l'opinion de certains, qu'ils peuvent se réincarner dans un règne aussi bas que le règne minéral. Le mot Sanscrit employé à cet endroit et sthanu, qui signifie aussi un pilier; ainsi compris, il donne la même idée que ce passage de l'Apocalypse, 3/12, qui dit, "Celui qui vaincra, j'en ferai un pilier dans le temple de mon Dieu, et il n'en sortira plus". Lorsque l'humanité aura atteint à la perfection, il viendra un temps où elle ne sera plus attachée à la roue des naissances et des morts, mais où elle restera dans les Mondes Invisibles pour y travailler à l'élévation d'autres êtres.

D'ailleurs, la métempsychose est une impossibilité dans la nature, parce qu'il y a dans chaque corps humain un esprit intérieur individuel, tandis que chaque tribu d'animaux est gouvernée par un esprit-groupe dont ces animaux forment une partie, et nul Ego soi-conscient ne peut entrer dans un corps gouverné par un autre esprit.

L'auteur de la question demande s'il n'est pas plus beau de croire en un ciel avec Dieu et les anges. Peut-être, mais ce qui nous intéresse n'est pas tant de savoir ce qui est plus agréable à notre fantaisie, que de trouver la Vérité, et bien que cette doctrine de la renaissance soit tournée en dérision et considérée comme païenne par quelques ignorants, il ne s'agit pas de savoir si elle est païenne ou non. Lorsque nous cherchons la solution d'un problème mathématique, nous ne nous inquiétons pas de savoir qui l'a trouvée le premier, mais si le problème a été bien résolu. Il en est de même de la doctrine considérée; qui l'a enseignée le premier importe peu. Ce qui nous intéresse, c'est de savoir que c'est la seule doctrine qui résolve tous les problèmes de la vie d'une manière rationnelle, tandis que nous paraît beaucoup plus ridicule la théorie d'après laquelle un homme qui ne s'est peut-être jamais soucié de musique et qui n'a aucune notion d'harmonie éprouve, aussitôt après sa mort, une passion irrésistible pour cet art et sera satisfait s'il peut souffler dans une trompette ou pincer de la harpe pendant toute l'éternité. 

<h2 id="section-4">Partie 7 - Questions Concernant les Enseignements de la Bible</h2>

### <h3 id="question-73">Question 73</h3>

Comment se fait-il que chaque secte interprète la Bible différemment, et que chaque chacune trouve une apparente justification aux idées qu'elle émet sur ce Livre?

RÉPONSE - Cette question, si elle est posée par un sceptique, doit lui procurer le grand plaisir d'y voir la justification de son idée, à savoir que les croyances de toutes les sectes religieuses sont erronées, et que la Bible est une collection de non-sens, alors que c'est en fait exactement le contraire. Nous ne soutenons pas que ce Livre soit d'origine entièrement Divine, ni qu'il soit, d'un bout à l'autre, la Parole de Dieu; nous reconnaissons le fait qu'il est une piètre traduction des originaux, et qu'il contient de nombreuses interpolations qui y ont été insérées à différentes époques pour soutenir des idées diverses; mais le seul fait que tant de vérités aient été accumulées sous un volume aussi restreint est une source de constant émerveillement pour l'occultiste qui sait ce qu'est ce Livre en réalité, car il en possède la clé.

Il y a un fait que le sceptique oublie de considérer. Il part de l'idée que si une certaine interprétation est vraie, toutes les autres doivent être nécessairement fausses. Cette idée est entièrement fausse. La vérité a de nombreuses faces et elle est éternelle; la recherche de la vérité doit aussi être universelle et être sans fin. Nous pouvons comparer la vérité à une montagne, et les diverses interprétations de cette vérité aux différents sentiers qui mènent à son sommet. Bien des gens cheminent le long de ces sentiers, et chacun pense que la voie qu'il suit est la seule voie, tant qu'il est au bas de la montange; il n'en aperçoit effectivement qu'une partie, et peut se croire autorisé à dire à ses frères, "Vous avez tort, prenez ma voie, c'est la seule qui conduise au sommet." Mais à mesure que tous ces gens avancent, ils voient que les sentiers convergent vers le sommet et conduisent finalement au même but.

On peut dire avec assurance qu'il n'existe aucun système de pensée ayant attiré et retenu l'attention d'un grand nombre d'adhérents pendant une longue période de temps, qui n'ait contenu sa part de vérité. Que nous nous en rendions compte ou non, il y a dans chaque secte un grain de l'enseignement divin qui mène graduellement ses fervents vers le sommet de la montagne, et c'est la raison pour laquelle nous devrions pratiquer la plus grande tolérance à l'égard de toute croyance.

### <h3 id="question-74">Question 74</h3>

Qu'entend-on par le deuxième aspect du Dieu Trinitaire?

RÉPONSE - Dieu est Un, comme la lumière est une; mais de même que la lumière, en traversant l'atmosphère, est réfractée en trois couleurs fondamentales: rouge, jaune et bleu, de même Dieu, lorsqu'Il se manifeste ou se réfléchit dans la nature, est triple dans Sa manifestation. Il est, premièrement, le principe Créateur, deuxièmement, le principe de Préservation, et troisièmement, le principe de Destruction des formes qui ont été créées, préservées pendant un temps parce qu'elles étaient utiles, puis détruites de façon à ce que la matière dont elles étaient façonnées puisse être employée à la construction de nouvelles formes.

Ces trois principes de Dieu ont été désignés sous différents noms dans les différentes religions, et beaucoup d'encre a été utilisée pour défendre ou décrier l'idée d'une Trinité qui est cependant évidente pour quiconque regarde d'un esprit attentif autour de lui dans la nature. Dans le monde occidental, nous avons coutume de donner au Second Aspect du Dieu Trinitaire, le principe préservateur unifié, le nom de Christ; et ce nom est très approprié dans un certain sens, car le Christ est venu pour enseigner l'Amour et la Fraternité Universelle, destinée à remplacer les nations qui guerroient les unes contre les autres, et Il a Lui-même dit qu'il y avait une phase encore plus élevée soit lorsque le royaume qu'Il devait établir serait remis au Père, et que tous seraient Un en Lui.

### <h3 id="question-75">Question 75</h3>

Les Anges de Justice sont-ils des Etres individuels?

RÉPONSE - Oui, ce sont de puissantes Individualités, ambassadeurs des Grands Anges Planétaires, et comme tels ils sont intéressés à la naissance de l'homme, l'aidant à choisir son milieu, assignant à chaque vie la juste destinée propre à amener les effets nécessaires. Ils dirigent les influences stellaires, afin qu'elles affectent chacun de façon à faciliter la liquidation des dettes passées qu'il a contractées envers autrui, et l'aident aussi à recueillir le bénéfice du bien qu'il a fait dans des vies passées.

Les Anges de Justice sont assistés en cela par une grande armée d'auxiliaires et d'esprits de la nature, qui ne sont pas encore individualisés, mais qui travaillent inconsciemment sous la direction des ces Grands Etres, à peu près comme les animaux sont dirigés par les esprits-groupes.

### <h3 id="question-76">Question 76</h3>

Les Anges et les Archanges veillent-ils sur nous individuellement aussi bien que collectivement, et savent-ils exactement ce que sont nos vies?

RÉPONSE - Les Seigneurs de l'Intellect, que Paul appelle les "Puissances des Ténèbres", parce qu'ils formaient l'humanité de la sombre Période de Saturne, alors que l'Univers émergeait du Chaos, travaillent uniquement avec l'homme.

Les Archanges qui étaient humains dans la Période de feu du Soleil, alors que l'univers avait la consistance de la "substance-désir", travaillent maintenant en tant qu'aides des esprits-groupes des animaux et en tant qu'esprits de race de l'humanité, parce que ces classes d'êtres ont un corps du désir.

Les Anges, qui formaient l'humanité de la Période de la Lune, travaillent avec l'homme, l'animal et la plante car, dans la Période de la Lune, l'univers avait la consistance de l'"éther" dont est formé le corps vital des trois règnes prénommés. Les Anges sont, par conséquent, les aides appropriés pour les fonctions vitales d'assimilation, de croissance et de reproduction. Dans leur travail avec l'humanité, ils sont les esprits de famille. Ils sont la cause de l'accroissement de la famille humaine, de l'accroissement des animaux et du rendement des champs.

L'homme, qui est un peu inférieur aux Anges, travaille avec les minéraux de la région chimique du Monde Physique. Il est pour les minéraux ce que les Etres Supérieurs sont pour nous. Il les éveille graduellement à la vie en les transformant en maisons, en viaducs, en chemins de fer, etc.

Dans une future incarnation de la Terre, lorsque ces minéraux seront devenus semblables à des plantes, l'homme aura appris à travailler avec la vie et sera alors à leur égard dans une position similaire à celle que les Anges occupent maintenant à notre égard. Ainsi il y a une progression sans fin, les plus avancés aidant les moins évolués, jusqu'à ce que tous aient atteint la perfection.

Pour répondre à la question d'une façon plus spécifique, nous dirons que les Archanges travaillent avec les nations et les races de la Terre, tandis que les Anges s'occupent plus particulièrement des familles et des individus au sein de la famille. L'"Ange Gardien", cependant, n'est pas exactement une entité d'une évolution supérieure, mais plutôt l'incarnation personnifiée de nos bonnes actions dans toutes nos vies passées; bien qu'invisible à nos yeux, il est toujours avec nous, nous encourageant à bien faire, nous incitant à faire mieux encore.

### <h3 id="question-77">Question 77</h3>

Les Anges ont-ils des ailes, comme on les représente?

RÉPONSE - Non, ils n'en ont pas, du moins pas telles qu'en ont les oiseaux; mais il y a quelques classes d'Etres dans le Monde de l'Esprit qui possèdent des accessoires ressemblant à des ailes. Ceux-ci, toutefois, ne leur servent pas à voler, ni à se mouvoir dans l'espace; ce sont des courants de force qui jaillit vers l'extérieur et qui peuvent être projetés dans une certaine direction à la façon dont nous employons nos propres membres. Ainsi, un Archange qui pousse les armées de deux nations à se battre peut envoyer dans une certaine direction un courant de force spirituelle qui paralysera de crainte les soldats d'une armée; dans l'autre direction, il projettera un courant qui enflammera l'armée opposée, influençant ainsi la bataille d'une manière insoupçonnée des combattants.

### <h3 id="question-78">Question 78</h3>

Les Rosicruciens acceptent-ils la Bible comme la Parole de Dieu, du commencement à la fin?

RÉPONSE - Certainement pas, particulièrement en ce qui concerne l'interprétation extrêmement étroite de certaines personnes qui pensent que le livre que nous avons maintenant est le seul ouvrage authentique jamais donné à l'humanité. Au mieux, la Bible ne peut être considérée que comme l'un des livres de Dieu, car il y a beaucoup d'autres écrits sacrés qui ont le droit d'être reconnus comme tels, et qui ne peuvent être éliminés par quelques ignorants tels que ceux qui ont mis les livres dits "apocryphes" au rebut.

En premier lieu, il convient de se rappeler que l'Ancien Testament a été écrit en Hébreu, à différentes époques, et par nombre d'écrivains, et que ces écrits n'avaient pas été rassemblés antérieurement à Esdras. De ces écrits en Hébreu, il n'existe plus un seul vestige. Dans un passé qui remonte à l'an 280 avant Jésus-Christ, l'Hébreu avait été abandonné dans la rédaction des Saintes Ecritures, et la version des Septante, ouTraduction Grecque était en usage. C'était la seule Bible existant au moment de la naissance de Jésus. Plus tard, quelques-uns des écrits en Hébreu furent rassemblés et classés par les Massorètes, une secte qui existait 700 ans environ après J.-C. Il s'agit du texte le meilleur et le plus précis.

La traduction anglaise la plus en usage de nos jours est la version dite du roi Jacques; mais Sa Majesté tenait bien plus à faire régner la paix dans son royaume qu'à l'exactitude de la traduction, et l'acte qui autorisa la traduction de la Bible avait interdit de traduire quelque passage que ce fût de manière à heurter les croyances du temps. Cela, pour éviter toute dissention dans son royaume. En outre, sur les quarante-sept traducteurs, trois seulement connaissaient l'Hébreu, et deux d'entre eux moururent avant l'achèvement de la traduction des Psaumes. Nombre de livres ont été rejetés comme apocryphes, des passages entiers ont été faussés de leur sens original pour se conformer à la superstition de l'époque. Martin Lüther, en Allemagne, traduisit le texte latin qui avait lui-même été traduit du Grec; ainsi, les occasions de contresens se sont multipliées. Ajoutons à cela que, dans l'Hébreu ancien, les points-voyelles sont omis, et qu'il n'ya pas de séparation entre les mots, de sorte qu'en insérant les points-voyelles de différentes manières, on obtient des mots et des phrases de sens entièrement différents, cela à chaque ligne, pour ainsi dire. Devant ces faits, il est évident que les chances d'une traduction exacte sont bien minces.

De plus, il n'était pas dans l'intention des écrivains originaux de l'Ancien Testament de faire de la Bible un "Livre de Dieu" accessible à tous, comme on peut d'ailleurs s'en rendre compte par cette citation tirée du Zohar, "Malheur à l'homme qui ne voit dans la Thora (la loi - la Bible) que de simples récits et des mots ordinaires, car en vérité si elle ne contenait que cela, nous serions capables même aujourd'hui de composer une Thora plus digne d'admiration. Mais il n'en est pas ainsi; chaque mot de la Thora renferme un sens élevé et un sublime mystère (...) Les récits de la Thora ne sont que le vêtement de la Thorah (...) Malheur à celui qui prend le vêtement de la Thora pour la Thora elle-même (...) Les simples ne tiennent compte que des habits et des récits de la Thorah; ils ne connaissent rien d'autre, ils ne voient pas ce qui est caché sous le vêtement; les hommes plus instruits ne font pas attention au vêtement, mais à ce qu'il enveloppe..."

En d'autres termes, il ne font pas attention à la lettre, mais tiennent compte uniquement de l'esprit. De même dans un champ de pommes de terre, il n'y a pas seulement ces végétaux, mais aussi le sol dans lequel ils sont cachés, ainsi dans la Bible, les perles de vérité occulte sont cachées dans ce qui, souvent, ne sont que de hideux habits. L'occultiste qui s'est préparé à posséder ces perles, en reçoit la clé et les voit distinctement. Aux autres, elles demeurent invisibles jusqu'à ce qu'ils aient travaillé pour obtenir cette clé. Ainsi, bien que l'histoire des pérégrinations des enfants d'Israël et de leurs relations avec certain Dieu soit partiellement vraie, il s'y trouve aussi une signification spirituelle beaucoup plus importante que l'histoire matérielle. Bien que les Evangiles contiennent les grandes lignes de la vie d'un être appelé Jésus, ils sont des formulaires d'initiation montrant les expériences par lesquelles chacun doit finalement passer, sur le chemin qui conduit à la vérité et à la vie. .

Ce chemin était prévu par les diverses personnes qui ont écrit la Bible et qui étaient ainsi des prophètes et des clairvoyants, mais seulement dans la mesure où il était possible de l'être à leur époque. 

Une nouvelle ère exigera une Bible nouvelle, un "mot" nouveau.

### <h3 id="question-79">Question 79</h3>

Quel est le point de vue des Rosicruciens sur la création du monde en sept jours?

RÉPONSE - Il y a deux récits de la création dans la Bible. L'un commence au premier verset du premier chapitre de la Genèse et se termine au troisième verset du deuxième chapitre. L'autre commence au quatrième verset.

Ces deux récits de la création semblent être grandement en désaccord sur plusieurs points. Le premier spécifie qu'au commencement la Terre était recouverte d'eau; le second qu'elle était sèche. Le premier nous informe que l'homme a été créé en dernier; le second, qu'il a été la première créature, etc. Ces di vergences semblent inconciliables, et offrent au sceptique la satisfaction de regarder avec un sourire de pitié les pauvres ignorants qui croient à de tels non-sens. Et pourtant, ces deux récits ne sont pas contradictoires; ils sont complémentaires, et en accord avec les faits scientifiques. Le premier traite de la genèse de la forme, le second de l'évolution de la conscience. La forme humaine, telle qu'elle est constituée à présent, est le chef-d'oeuvre de l'évolution, construite sur la base de toutes les formes inférieures qui l'ont précédée. La Vie qu'est l'homme, le penseur, est sans commencement ni fin, éternelle comme Dieu Lui-même, et cette Vie existait avant toutes les formes, comme il est dit dans le second récit de la création.

En ce qui concerne le temps pendant lequel il est dit que cette création de la forme a eu lieu, les Rosicruciens n'enseignent pas ou ne croient pas qu'elle s'est accomplie en sept jours de vingt-quatre heures, mais dans notre système de manifestation, sept grandes transformations de la Terre sont nécessaires pour faciliter la pleine évolution de la soi-conscience et du pouvoir de l'âme par les esprits en évolution. Trois périodes et demie ont été employées à construire nos véhicules; le reste sera nécessaire pour l'évolution de la conscience.

Dans le deuxième verset au début de la Bible, il est dit qu'au commencement la Terre était sombre et informe. Cela se passait dans la Période de Saturne, alors que le brouillard de feu naissant se formait de la substance primordiale de l'espace.

Le troisième verset nous informr que Dieu dit, "Que la Lumière soit", passage dont on s'est moqué comme devant prouver l'ignorance de ses auteurs et l'inconsistance de leur récit comparé avec les faits scientifiques; car, disent en raillant les contradicteurs, "puisque le Soleil et la Lune ne furent créés que le quatrième jour, comment pouvait-il y avoir de la lumière avant ce moment-là? Or, il n'est pas question du monde tel qu'il est aujourd'hui, c'est-à-dire d'une masse solide. Cette masse assurément serait restée noire tant qu'il n'y aurait pas eu une source de lumière extérieure; mais, à cette époque, la terre était un monde en formation et, selon la théorie nébulaire, il doit y avoir eu, d'abord, une période de chaleur obscure à laquelle nous avons donné le nom de Période de Saturne. Plus tard, le brouillard, entré en ignition, est devenu lumineux; la lumière est intérieure et ne dépend pas d'un Soleil et d'une Lune extérieurs. Ce deuxième degré du développement de notre planète est appelé la Période du Soleil.

Dieu dit, continue le récit biblique, "Qu'il y ait une expansion entre les eaux et qu'elle sépare les eaux d'avec les eaux." Le mot rendu ici par "expansion" est traduit "firmament" dans la version autorisée du Roi Jacques, mais nous employons le texte Massorétique, traduit par des connaisseurs non limités par un édit royal comme l'étaient les auteurs de la version du Roi Jacques. L'emploi du mot "expansion" met le récit de la Bible en accord avec la théorie nébulaire, car lorsqu'un brouillard de feu se forme dans l'espace, de l'humidité est générée par le contact de cette masse brûlante avec l'espace environnant, qui est froid. Cette humidité devient brûlante et se dilate en vapeur qui s'élance du noyau igné, puis se refroidit, se condense et redescend à la source de chaleur. Ainsi cette expansion dans les eaux divise l'eau d'avec l'eau, l'humidité dense restant près du noyau igné et la vapeur à l'extérieur. Cette étape dans la solidification de la Terre est appelée la Période de la Lune.

L'ébullition continuelle de l'eau entourant le noyau igné forma finalement une croûte, et la terre ferme apparut. On nous dit que "Dieu appela "Terre" la partie sèche".

Pendant la première partie de la Période actuelle, la Terre était aussi obscure que dans la Période de Saturne. Seules, les substances minérales existaient. Cette phase est appelée Epoque Polaire.

La Période ignée du Soleil trouve sa réplique dans l'Epoque Hyperboréenne, décrite aux versets 11-19, comme étant l'époque où les plantes furent générées, et où la Terre devint une planète éclairée du dehors par le Soleil et la Lune. Cette phase termine le travail accompli durant le quatrième grand jour dans le développement de notre Terre.

Pendant l'Epoque Lémurienne, nous avons une récapitulation des conditions de la Période de la Lune, un noyau brûlant et une atmosphère de brouillard de feu, ainsi que la création des espèces animales inférieures, décrite dans la Bible comme ayant été l'oeuvre du cinquième jour. Pendant l'Epoque Atlantéenne, les mammifères et l'homme furent formés, et ce fut l'oeuvre du sixième jour. Lorsque, dans l'Epoque Aryenne actuelle, l'homme devint un être doué de raison, les Dieux se reposèrent pour le laisser travailler à son propre salut, sous les lois jumelles de renaissance et de cause à effet.

### <h3 id="question-80">Question 80</h3>

La Bible enseigne l'immortalité de l'âme. La Philosophie Rosicrucienne enseigne la même chose, ouvertement, en faisant appel à la raison. N'y a-t-il pas de preuves positives de l'immortalité?

RÉPONSE - L'auteur de la question se trompe lorsqu'il dit que la Bible enseigne l'immortalité de l'âme. Dans l'ancien Testament, il n'est pas fait une seule fois mention du mot immortalitéou ciel dans le sens d'une possession de l'homme. Il y est explicitement affirmé que "Le Ciel et même les cieux sont au Seigneur mais Il a donné la Terre aux enfants des hommes" (Psaume 115/16). Il y est aussi enseigné explicitement que "l'âme qui pèche mourra" (Ezéchiel 18/4, 20). Si l'âme était immortelle, cela serait une impossibilité. Dans le Nouveau Testament, les mots "immortel" ou "immortalité" sont employés six fois seulement. Ils désignent quelque chose à atteindre, ou quelque chose qui est un attribut de Dieu.

En ce qui concerne l'esprit, la question est différente, et même là où il en est question, le mot "immortel" n'est pas employé. Il est fait allusion à l'immortalité dans maints passages de la Bible, de la même manière détournée qu'on y sous-entend la loi de renaissance, mais la doctrine de la renaissance a un avantage sur celle de l'immortalité de l'esprit humain, du fait qu'elle a été enseignée au moins une fois d'une manière précise (Matthieu 11/14) lorsque le Christ a dit de Jean-Baptiste: "Celui-ci est Elie". La doctrine de la renaissance est sous-entendue dans cette parole, car si l'esprit d'Elie revivait en Jean-Baptiste, c'est qu'il avait survécu à la mort du corps. L'enseignement de l'immortalité était à cette époque l'un des enseigenements des Mystères, mais même de nos jours, elle est difficilement acceptée, si ce n'est par celui qui, entré dans la voie de l'initiation, se rend compte pour lui-même de la continuité de la vie.

On peut dire cependant, en réponse à cette question, que tout dépend du sens donné à "preuve positive", et si la personne qui demande une preuve est qualifiée pour en juger. On ne peut faire la démonstration d'un problème de trigonométrie à un enfant. Par contre, lorsque celui-ci aura grandi, et qu'on lui en aura enseigné les débuts, il sera facile de lui démontrer le problème. On ne peut prouver non plus l'existence des couleurs et de la lumière à un aveugle-né; ce sont des faits qu'il ne peut apprécier parce qu'il lui manque la faculté requise. Mais si, grâce à une opération chirurgicale, il acquiert la faculté de voir, il sera inutile de lui prouver ces faits; il en verra par lui-même la réalité. Pour des raisons analogues, personne ne peut apprécier les preuves de l'immortalité de l'esprit avant de s'être mis en état de voir l'esprit; alors il lui sera facile d'avoir la preuve positive de son immortalité, de son existence avant la naissance et de sa persistance après la mort. Avant de s'être ainsi lui-même qualifié, il devra se satisfaire des déductions raisonnables auxquelles on arrive de diverses manières.

### <h3 id="question-81">Question 81</h3>

Y a-t-il dans la Bible quelque autorité affirmant la théorie de la renaissance?

RÉPONSE - Oui, à maints endroits bien que cette théorie soit enseignée directement dans un seul passage. Les prêtres juifs croyaient à la théorie de la renaissance, sinon ils n'auraient pas envoyé demander à Jean-Baptiste, "Es- tu Elie?", ainsi qu'il est rapporté dans l'Evangile de Jean 1/21; et dans l'Evangile de Matthieu 11/14, les paroles du Christ concernant Jean-Baptiste ne présentent aucune ambiguité. Il dit, "Celui-ci est Elie". En une autre occasion, sur le Mont de la Transfiguration, le Christ dit encore, "Elie est déjà venu, ils l'ont traité comme ils l'ont voulu", et on nous fait savoir que les disciples "savaient qu'Il parlait de Jean" qui avait été décapité par Hérode.

Dans Matthieu 16/14, Il demande à Ses disciples, "Qu'est-ce que le peuple dit que je suis?". Et ils Lui répondirent, "Certains disent que tu es Jean- Baptiste, d'autres, Elie, et d'autres encore, Jérémie ou quelqu'un des prophètes." Et il est à remarquer que le Christ ne les contredit en aucune façon, Lui qui était Leur maître; s'ils avaient eu une idée erronée concernant la doctrine de la renaissance, c'eût été certainement Son devoir de les en avertir. Mais, Il ne le fit pas; bien plus, Il leur enseigna directement la renaissance, comme l'indique le passage ci-dessus.

Il y a aussi des cas relatés dans la Bible où il est question d'une personne choisie avant sa naissance dans le but d'accomplir une certaine tâche. Un ange avait annoncé la venue de Samson, et sa mission qui était de détruire les Philistins (Juges 13/3-24). Le Seigneur dit au prophète Jérémie, "Avant que tu ne naisses, je t'ai sanctifié et je t'ai ordonné prophète entre les nations" (Jérémie 1/5). Les missions de Jean et de Jésus leur ont été assignées avant leur naissance. Une personne est choisie pour une certaine mission, à cause d'une aptitude spéciale. Cette compétence présuppose que de nombreuses mises en pratique, avant la naissance, ont été réalisées dans unevie passée. Ainsi, la doctrine de la renaissance est aussi enseignée implicitement dans les cas précités.

### <h3 id="question-82">Question 82</h3>

Selon la Bible, l'homme seul a reçu une âme. Pourquoi donc dites-vous que les animaux ont un esprit-groupe?

RÉPONSE - Au premier chapitre de la Genèse, verset 20, on nous enseigne que Dieu dit, "Que les eaux abondent en créatures qui se déplacent et qui ont la vie." Le mot employé en hébreu est nephesh qui signifie souffle. Ce mot est aussi employé au deuxième chapitre du même livre, verset 7, où il est dit, "Le Seigneur Dieu forma l'homme du limon de la terre et insuffla dans ses narines le souffle de vie, (nephesh) et l'homme devint une "nephesh chayim", c'est-à- dire une "créature respirante". Non point une âme vivante, comme cela est traduit. La traduction du Roi Jacques a été modifiée par des gens qui avaient plus de respect pour la vérité que pour les idées préconçues; ils ont consenti à écrire dans la marge le mot "âme" comme alternative pour la lecture du mot nephesh au chapitre 1, verset 20, où la création des animaux est annoncée, de sorte que même dans la Bible actuelle, il est admis que les animaux ont une âme.

Pourtant, cette traduction n'est pas correcte; nephesh signifie souffle et non pas âme. Le mot Hébraïque pour "âme" est neshamah. L'âme n'est pas synonyme d'esprit, L'esprit est Ruach, de sorte que la Genèse ne fait pas mention de l'esprit de l'homme ou de l'animal, car l'esprit n'a point de genèse, Il EST. Les formes humaines et animales, maintenues par le souffle ont eu un commencement, et c'est ce qu'annonce la Genèse. Cette idée est parfaitement en accord avec l'Ecclésiaste 3/19 où Salomon dit, parlant du corps formé du limon de la terre, que l'homme n'a aucune supériorité sur la bête, car de même que l'un meurt, l'autre meurt aussi: ils ont tous le même souffle (nephesh), l'un et l'autre vont en un même lieu (à savoir le Monde du Désir).

Si l'auteur de la question n'accepte que le texte et la version anglaise de la Bible, comme si elle avait été écrite dans cette langue, il serait plausible de demander, "Si l'homme a reçu une âme de la façon décrite dans la Bible, où la femme a-t-elle reçu la sienne, ou bien est-elle sans âme?

### <h3 id="question-83">Question 83</h3>

Est-il vrai qu'Eve a été tirée de la côte d'Adam?

RÉPONSE - Parmi les quarante-sept traducteurs de la Bible du Roi Jacques, trois seulement connaissaient l'Hébreu, et deux d'entre eux moururent avant que les Psaumes aient été traduits. De plus, dans la langue hébraïque, particulièrement dans les anciens textes, les points-voyelles sont omis; un mot peut ainsi avoir différents sens selon la manière dont on place ces points. Dans l'histoire de la côte d'Adam, le mot qui nous occupe, lorsqu'il est ponctué d'une certaine façon, se lit "tsad" qui signifie côte; ponctué d'une autre façon, il se lit "tsela", qui veut dire côté. Les enseignements occultes concernant le développement de la Terre et de l'homme affirment qu'il fut un temps où, sur un point particulier, l'homme était à l'image de Dieu ou à celle des Elohim qui l'avaient créé; il était à la fois mâle et femelle, hermaphrodite, capable de générer un autre être de lui-même. Plus tard, il devint nécessaire, pour son évolution ultérieure, de développer un cerveau; et alors qu'auparavant il extériorisait de lui-même la double force créatrice, positive et négative, la moitié de celle-ci fut désormais retenue dans le but de construire un cerveau, un larynx et un système nerveux, organes de la pensée et de la parole au moyen desquels l'homme peut mettre en action son corps physique et s'exprimer par la parole. Certains esprits retiennent la force créatrice positive masculine et n'extériorisent que la force négative féminine, alors que d'autres retiennent la force féminine ou négative et extériorise la force positive. On peut donc dire que Dieu a retiré un côté de leur être, non une côte. Cette manière de lire le mot en question, c'est-à- dire "côté" a un droit égal à celle de "côte"; de plus, elle a le mérite d'expliquer un fait inexplicable autrement.

### <h3 id="question-84">Question 84</h3>

Si Dieu a fait l'homme à Son image, selon Sa ressemblance, c'est-à-dire parfait, pourquoi les différentes époques antérieures à la Chute d'Adam et d'Eve étaient-elles nécessaires?

RÉPONSE - L'auteur de cette question part d'un point de vue erroné. La Bible dit que Dieu vit son oeuvre et estima qu'elle était "bonne", mais non parfaite. Eût-elle été parfaite, il n'y aurait plus rien eu à faire et l'évolution aurait été superflue. La race humaine n'est devenue définitivement humaine que dans la dernière partie de l'Epoque Lémurienne, lorsque l'esprit commença à pénétrer dans ses corps. L'humanité de ce temps-là, Adam et Eve, était fort différente de ce qu'elle est à présent. Elle était aussi le fruit de l'évolution, car il n'y a pas de création spontanée. Ces êtres avaient progressé du règne minéral d'où ils étaient sortis, à travers les phases d'un développement identique à celui des végétaux et des animaux, et ils ne formaient pas un couple, selon les données traditionnelles, mais une humanité à la fois masculine et féminine. "Il les créa mâle et femelle", lisons-nous dans la Bible; en outre, ce n'était pas la première fois que l'homme s'était trouvé sur la Terre, ou que la Terre avait été peuplée, comme on peut s'en rendre compte dans Genèse 1/28, où il fut commandé à l'homme d'aller et de RE-peupler la Terre, montrant ainsi que la Terre avait été la demeure d'autres êtres antérieurement à la venue de ceux appelés Adam et Eve. Flavius Josèphe dit qu'Adam signifie "terre rouge", et le mot Hébreu "Admah", dont dérive Adam, signifie "terre ferme", ce qui décrit très bien la situation. Adm (tel qu'il est écrit dans le texte Hébreu) ne vint pas sur la Terre avant qu'elle ne se fût solidifiée et ne fût devenue ferme, mais il y vint avant qu'elle ne se fût refroidie au point où elle en est maintenant, donc, à cette époque, elle était réellement rouge et à l'état brûlant. Pendant les époques antérieures à l'Epoque Lémurienne, les esprits planaient au-dessus de la Terre ignée, et ils aidaient à la former, à la modeler telle qu'elle est à présent. Les esprits humains apprenaient alors des leçons qui ne les concernent plus actuellement. A cette époque, nous étions inconscients, mais le travail s'accomplissait tout aussi bien, de la même façon, par exemple, que nos organes digestifs accomplissent les opérations chimiques nécessaires à la digestion et à l'assimilation, bien que nous ignorions ces processus dans notre intellect conscient. Il est cependant évident que, de même que le travail de l'enfant à l'école maternelle et à l'école primaire constitue la base essentielle des enseignements des lycées et des universités, ainsi les premières époques ont été les fondements de nos conditions actuelles. Elles étaient aussi nécessaires que d'apprendre l'alphabet avant d'essayer de lire.

### <h3 id="question-85">Question 85</h3>

Quel a été le péché ou la chute dans l'Eden?

RÉPONSE - Lorsque la Terre est sortie du Chaos, elle a d'abord passé par une phase rouge sombre, connue sous le nom d'Epoque Polaire. L'humanité a d'abord développé un corps dense, fort différent de notre véhicule actuel, bien entendu. Dans la phase ignée ou Epoque Hyperboréenne, le corps vital fut ajouté, et l'homme devint une sorte de plante, c'est-à-dire qu'il possédait les mêmes véhicules que ceux qu'ont nos plantes aujourd'hui, avec une conscience similaire, ou plutôt une inconscience, semblable à celle que nous avons dans le sommeil sans rêves, lorsque les corps dense et vital reposent sur le lit.

En ce temps-là, dans l'Epoque Hyperboréenne, le corps de l'homme était un énorme sac rempli de gaz, flottant au-dessus de la terre en feu, et il projetait des spores qui croissaient et qui étaient utilisées comme véhicules par d'autres entités. A ce moment, l'homme était bissexué, il était hermaphrodite.

A l'Epoque Lémurienne, lorsque la terre se fut quelque peu refroidie, et que des îlots de croûte se furent formés au milieu des mers en ébullition, alors le corps de l'homme se solidifia aussi quelque peu, et devint plus semblable à celui que nous voyons aujourd'hui. Il présentait une apparence simiesque, un tronc court avec des membres énormes, les talons projetés en arrière; la partie supérieure de la tête manquait presque totalement. L'homme vivait dans une atmosphère de vapeur appelée par les occultistes "brouillard de feu"; il n'avait pas de poumons, et respirait au moyen de tubes. Il possédait à l'intérieur un organe comparable à une vessie qu'il gonflait avec de l'air chaud pour l'aider à franchir les énormes crevasses qui se produisaient lorsque les éruptions volcaniques disloquaient la terre sur laquelle il vivait. De l'arrière de sa tête se projetait un organe qui, maintenant, se trouve à l'intérieur de la boîte cranienne et que les anatomistes appellent glande pinéale, ou troisième oeil, bien qu'elle n'ait jamais été un oeil, mais un organe tactile. Le corps était alors dénué de sensation, mais lorsque l'homme s'approchait trop près d'un cratère volcanique, la chaleur en était perçue par cet organe qui l'avertissait de s'en écarter avant que son corps ne fût détruit.

A ce moment-là, le corps dense de l'homme s'était déjà solidifié à un tel point qu'il lui était devenu impossible de se reproduire par spores, et il était nécessaire qu'il développe un cerveau, ou organe de la pensée. La force créatrice dont nous nous servons maintenant pour construire routes, viaducs, moyens de locomotion de toutes sortes, etc., dans le monde extérieur, était alors employée intérieurement pour la construction d'organes. Comme toutes les forces, la force créatrice étant positive et négative, un des pôles fut tourné vers le haut pour construire le cerveau et le larynx, laissant l'autre pôle disponible pour la création d'un autre corps. L'homme cessa donc d'être une unité créatrice complète. Chaque être humain ne possédait plus que la moitié de la force créatrice, il dut chercher son complément en dehors de lui-même.

Or, en ces temps lointains, "leurs yeux n'étaient pas ouverts", et les êtres humains d'alors étaient inconscients les uns des autres dans le Monde Physique, quoique conscients et alertes dans le Monde Spirituel. Aussi, sous la direction des Anges qui étaient particulièrement aptes à les assister en ce qui concerne la reproduction, ils étaient rassemblés dans de grands temples, à certaines époques de l'année, lorsque les lignes de forces entre les planètes étaient propices, et là, l'acte créateur était accompli comme un sacrifice religieux. Et lorsque cet homme primitif, Adam, se trouvait en contact sexuel avec la femme, l'esprit, pendant un instant, perçait le voile de la chair, et "Adam connaissait (ou devenait conscient de) sa femme"; il ressentait sa présence physique. Telle est la signification du récit de la Bible partout où l'on emploie cette chaste expression; c'est ainsi que nous apprenons qu'"Elkana connut sa femme, Hannah, et celle-ci conçut Samuel". De même, dans le Nouveau Testament, lorsque l'ange vint dire à Marie qu'elle devait être la mère du Sauveur, elle répondit: "Comment cela se pourrait-il, puisque je ne connais point d'homme?".

Le péché est une action contraire à la loi. Tant que l'humanité se multipliait sous la direction des Anges qui comprenaient les lignes de forces cosmiques, l'enfantement se faisait sans douleur, ce qui est le cas chez les animaux sauvages qui se reproduisent seulement aux époques propices de l'année sous la direction de leur esprit-groupe: Mais lorsque l'homme, agissant d'après le conseil d'esprits placés à mi-chemin entre l'humanité et les Anges, entreprit de procréer quand bon lui semblait, sans tenir compte des lignes de forces cosmiques, ce péché de "manger de l'arbre de la connaissance" fut la cause de l'enfantement dans la douleur que l'Ange annonça à Eve. Il ne l'a pas maudite, mais lui a simplement indiqué ce qui résulterait de l'usage ignorant et inconsidéré de la fonction créatrice.

### <h3 id="question-86">Question 86</h3>

L'Arbre de Vie dont il est parlé dans la Bible (Genèse 2/9, Apocalypse 2/7 et 22/2) est-il la même chose que la pierre philosophale des alchimistes?

RÉPONSE - Oui et non. Pour bien comprendre le sujet, il est nécessaire de remonter dans l'histoire de l'humanité. Il fut un temps où les hommes étaient bissexuels et capables de générer un corps sans l'aide d'un autre être. Mais quand il devint nécessaire de construire le cerveau afin que l'esprit soit capable de créer par la pensée aussi bien que dans le Monde Physique, la moitié de la force sexuelle fut retenue pour construire un organe de la pensée. Alors il devint nécessaire que chacun cherche la coopération d'un autre humain qui exprime le pôle opposé de la force créatrice, disponible pour la reproduction. N'ayant pas de cerveau, et "leurs yeux n'étant pas encore ouverts", ils étaient bien entendu inconscients du Monde Physique et incapables de se guider eux-mêmes. C'est pourquoi les Anges les rassemblaient à certaines époques de l'année, lorsque les forces planétaires étaient favorables pour effectuer l'acte générateur qui était accompli comme un sacrifice religieux au cours duquel ils abandonnaient une partie de leur corps pour la génération d'un véhicule pour un autre esprit. Dans cette étroite étreinte, l'esprit perçait le voile de la chair, et Adam "connaissait" sa femme. Plus tard, lorsque la conscience des humains se fût centrée un peu plus sur le Monde Physique, et que quelques-uns d'entre eux commencèrent à percevoir vaguement les corps dont nous sommes maintenant si complètement conscients, ces pionniers se mirent à prêcher l'évangile du corps, apprenant aux autres qu'ils possédaient un corps physique, car la majorité étaient alors inconscients de cet instrument, tout comme nous sommes actuellement inconscients de notre estomac, lorsque nous sommes en bonne santé.

Ensuite, on remarqua que ces corps mouraient et la question se posa, parmi les pionniers, de savoir comment un tel corps pouvait être remplacé. La solution fut donnée à l'homme par une certaine classe d'esprits qui étaient les retardataires de l'évolution des Anges, des demi-dieux, pourrions-nous dire. Ces esprits Lucifer, ou donneurs de lumière, éclairèrent l'humanité naissante sur ses pouvoirs de générer un corps à n'importe quel moment. Mais ces corps n'étaient alors pas parfaits - ils ne sont pas parfaits de nos jours - et bien entendu la génération accomplie sans égard aux conditions planétaires avait même produit des corps inférieurs à ceux qui auraient été générés autrement, fait qui s'ajoute à la parturition douloureuse annoncée par l'Ange.

Dès lors la fonction génératrice a été exercée sans restriction par la race humaine ignorante. Mais par le fait de la mort, il a été possible aux Anges d'enseigner à l'humanité, entre la mort et une nouvelle naissance, comment construire un corps graduellement meilleur. Si l'homme avait appris, dans ce passé lointain, à renouveler son corps vital, comme on lui avait appris à générer un corps physique, selon son propre plaisir, la mort aurait été une impossibilité, et l'homme serait devenu immortel comme les Dieux. Mais il aurait alors immortalisé ses imperfections et rendu tout progrès impossible. C'est le renouvellement du corps vital que la Bible désigne par les mots "manger de l'Arbre de Vie". A l'époque où il reçut les éclaircissements concernant la génération, l'homme était un être spirituel dont les yeux n'étaient pas encore aveuglés par le monde matériel, et il aurait pu ap prendre le secret de vitaliser son corps à volonté, frustrant ainsi l'évolution, Nous voyons donc que la mort, lorsqu'elle vient naturellement, n'est pas une malédiction, mais notre plus grande et notre meilleure amie, car elle nous libère d'un instrument au moyen duquel nous ne pouvons plus rien apprendre; elle nous enlève d'un milieu que nous avons dépassé, afin que nous puissions apprendre à construire un meilleur corps dans un milieu de plus grande envergure, un corps dans lequel nous pourrons faire de plus grands progrès vers la perfection.

Dans ce pèlerinage, il vient enfin un temps où l'homme est qualifié pour posséder les pouvoirs de la Vie. Le corps qu'il s'est construit devient pur et utilisable pendant une période de temps plus longue qu'auparavant. C'est alors qu'il commence à chercher "la pierre philosophale" ou "l'élixir de vie", ou tout autre nom qu'il lui plaît d'utiliser. Les alchimistes visaient à fabriquer ce véhicule pur et sacré, mais non par un procédé chimique de laboratoire, comme le suppose la multitude ignorante. Il avait été nécessaire de trouver une terminologie particulière à un époque où une Eglise dominante et apostate aurait condamné à mort les alchimistes si la vérité avait été connue. Lorsqu'ils parlaient de transmuer les métaux vils en or, les alchimistes disaient vrai, non seulement du point de vue matériel mais aussi du point de vue spirituel, car l'or a toujours été le symbole de l'esprit, et ils visaient à spiritualiser leurs corps, faits d'une texture grossière.

Partout, le pur et magnifique symbole de la transparence a été donné pour désigner le pouvoir de la pureté. Dans l'Ancien Testament, on dit du Temple de Salomon qu'il fut "bâti sans bruit de marteau", que le plus bel ornement en était la Mer de Fonte. Hiram Abiff, le maître-artisan réussit, comme chef- d'oeuvre final, à fondre tous les métaux de la terre en un alliage transparent comme le verre. A la fin du Nouveau Testament (Apocalypse 21/9 à 22/5), on nous parle d'une merveilleuse cité ayant en son milieu une mer de verre. En Orient, l'initié vise à devenir une âme de diamant, pure et transparente. En Occident, la Pierre Philosophale est le symbole de l'âme purifiée, extraite des corps qui ont été transmués et spiritualisés. "L'âme qui a péché mourra" mais l'âme pure est immortalisée par l'élixir de vie, l'"Arbre de Vie", en un corps vital qui durera des milliers d'années comme véhicule de l'esprit.

### <h3 id="question-87">Question 87</h3>

Le Seigneur a eu de la considération pour Abel et son offrande sanglante, mais non pas pour Caïn et sa pure et douce offrande. Pourquoi?

RÉPONSE - L'auteur de la question se méprend, l'offrande d'Abel n'était pas une offrande sanglante. On ne mentionen nulle part qu'Abel ait tué un animal. La légende des franc-maçons occultes, que nous donnons en partie, est la suivante:

Un jour, les Elohim créèrent Eve; Samaël, esprit Lucifer, s'unit à elle et elle conçut Caïn. Il l'abandonna avant la naissance de ce fils qui fut ainsi "le fils de la veuve". Puis l'Elohim Jéhovah créa Adam qui s'unit à Eve, et elle conçut Abel. Il vint un temps où Caïn et Abel apportèrent leurs offrandes à Jéhovah. Abel apporta ses troupeaux créés par Dieu, alors que Caïn apporta le travail de ses propres mains, le grain. EtJéhovah reçut le don qu'Abel avait trouvé tout prêt sous sa main, créé par la nature, mais il méprisa le sacrifice qui était le résultat de la capacité créatrice de Caïn. Alors, Caïn tua Abel, et il fut maudit. Adam s'unit de nouveau à Eve, et elle conçut Seth.

De Caïn et de Seth sortirent deux classes de gens. Les descendants de Caïn furent Tubal-Caïn et Hiram Abiff, maîtres-artisans adroits qui savaient comment façonner les choses de leurs mains, ayant en eux la capacité divine de créer , de faire pousser deux brins d'herbe là où il n'y en avait qu'un auparavant. C'est d'eux que descendent tous ceux qui travaillent de leurs mains, et qui s'efforcent de conquérir la terre et ses ressources.

De Seth descendent les rois et les prêtres qui recevaient leur sagesse toute faite de la main des Dieux, et prenaient les choses comme ils les trouvaient. Parmi eux était Salomon, le plus sage d'entre les hommes, mais il n'avait pas travaillé lui-même pour acquérir cette sagesse, il la reçut comme un don de Dieu. Ces deux classes de gens existent encore aujourd'hui sur terre et se disputent la suprématie. L'une constitue les Pouvoirs temporels progressistes, l'autre le corps conservateur des Prêtres.

La raison pour laquelle Jéhovah accepta l'offrande d'Abel était qu'il avait pris les choses comme il les avait trouvées, toutes créées; il était un fils de l'homme, et il n'aspirait pas au divin pouvoir créateur. Mais Caïn était de nature divine, il avait en lui l'instinct créateur, et cela ne plaisait pas à son Dieu.

### <h3 id="question-88">Question 88</h3>

Quelle est la signification ésotérique de l'Arche d'Alliance?

RÉPONSE - Dans les premiers chapitres de la Bible où il est question du Paradis perdu, nous lisons que l'homme prit à son compte l'emploi de la force créatrice, en mésusa dans son ignorance, péchant ainsi contre les lois de la nature. La reproduction est une des facultés du corps vital qui est l'ombre de l'Esprit Vital, second aspect de l'Esprit Triple en l'homme.

On dit que les Chérubins, armés d'une épée flamboyante, ont été placés en sentinelle à la porte de l'Eden lorsque l'homme en fut chassé, de peur qu'il ne mangeât de l'Arbre de Vie et ne devînt immortel. Les Chérubins forment la grande Hiérarchie Créatrice qui avait pris la Terre en charge pendant la Période du Soleil, quand le corps vital était en germination et que l'Esprit Vital fut éveillé.

Alors commença le long pèlerinage de l'être humain à travers le désert de la matière, et l'Arche d'Alliance était le symbole de l'homme dans cette phase migratoire de son existence. Pendant ce pèlerinage dans le désert, les barres qui servaient à porter l'Arche restaient toujours en place, pour montrer qu'elle n'avait pas de demeure fixe; mais lorsque l'Arche arriva dans le temple construit sans bruit de marteau, le Temple de Salomon, son pèlerinage était terminé et les barres furent retirées.

En tant que symbole de l'homme, l'Arche d'Alliance contenait le Livre de la Loi donné pour enseigner à l'homme l'action juste. Il y avait la verge d'Aaron qui fleurissait, sceptre de pouvoir, symbolisant la force spirituelle latente en chaque homme. Cette verge est la réplique de la lance de Parsifal, instrument du mal entre les mains de Klingsor, le magicien noir, ainsi que dans les mains du soldat Romain, tandis que Parsifal, pur et spirituel, l'utilisa pour guérir les blessures d'Amfortas. La verge d'Aaron a été employée contre les Egyptiens pour causer la détresse et l'affliction, et elle fut alors cachée dans l'Arche, comme symbole du fait que l'homme ayant à un moment donné possédé le pouvoir spirituel, en avait mésusé, et que ce pouvoir était maintenant caché en lui.

Dans l'Arche se trouvait aussi le vase de manne. Ce n'était pas une nourriture pour le corps, comme on l'a expliqué de manière matérialiste. Le mot "manne" est presque universel. En Sanscrit, nous avons"manas", le penseur. En Allemand, en Anglais, dans les langues Scandinaves, et dans de nombreuses autres, nous avons le même mot "man" pour désigner le penseur. Le vase de manne fut placé dans l'Arche pour commémorer l'époque où l'Ego était entré dans la forme qu'il avait construite et devint un esprit individuel intérieur.

Cela constitua la "chute" dans les conditions matérielles, nécessitant la génération de corps denses. Lorsque l'homme s'arrogea le pouvoir de générer des corps physiques à n'importe quel moment, il fut exilé de la Région Ehérique, de peur qu'il ne se rende maître du secret de vitaliser les corps imparfaits qu'il générait et de rendre l'évolution impossible.

Nous avons mentionné, dans la première partie de notre réponse, le fait que les Chérubins sont les auteurs de nos pouvoirs vitaux, aussi doivent-ils les préserver jusqu'à ce que l'homme ait acquis les qualités requises pour la maîtrise de soi. C'est pourquoi on dit qu'ils ont été placés à l'entrée du Jardin d'Eden avec une Epée Flamboyante, et il est très significatif que sur les portes du Temple de Salomon on trouve les Chérubins, tenant dans leurs mains, non plus une Epée Flamboyante, mais une fleur ouverte. La fleur est l'organe générateur de la plante qui accomplit l'acte de génération d'une manière pure, sans passion; et lorsque l'homme aura appris à devenir pur et sans passion de manière à concevoir toute forme de façon immaculée, il pourra entrer dans le Temple de Dieu, comme l'Arche est entrée dans le Temple de Salomon, et y demeurer, comme l'indique l'enlèvement des barres, et ainsi que le prophétise l'Apocalypse où l'Esprit annonce, "Celui qui vaincra, j'en ferai un pilier dans le Temple de mon Dieu, et il n'en sortira plus."

### <h3 id="question-89">Question 89</h3>

Les diverses fêtes Chrétiennes de l'année ont-elles une signification occulte?

RÉPONSE - Oui, les fêtes chrétiennes de l'année ont une signification occulte très profonde. Du point de vue matériel, les planètes sont autant de masses de matière voyageant dans leur orbite en obéissant à des lois dites aveugles, mais pour l'occultiste ce sont de Grands Esprits se mouvant dans l'espace, comme nous nous mouvons dans le monde.

Lorsqu'on voit un homme faire des gestes, nous y attachons une certaine importance. S'il secoue la tête, nous y voyons un signe de dénégation, mais s'il l'incline, nous y voyons un signe d'affirmation. S'il fait signe à une personne, la paume de la main tournée vers lui, il l'invite à venir à lui, mais s'il tourne la paume des mains vers l'extérieur, il lui fait signe de s'éloigner. Dans le cas de l'univers, nous ne pensons généralement pas qu'il y ait un sens quelconque dans les positions changeantes des planètes, mais pour l'occultiste, il y a un sens des plus profonds dans tous les phénomènes variés des cieux. Ils correspondent aux gestes d'un homme.

Krishna signifie oint, et quiconque avait une mission spéciale à remplir, dans les temps anciens, était oint. Lorsqu'en hiver, le Soleil est au-dessous de l'équateur, au nadir de sa course, les impulsions spirituelles sont les plus fortes dans le monde. Pour notre bien-être matériel, il est nécessaire que le Soleil revienne dans l'hémisphère nord, et ainsi nous parlons du moment où le Soleil reprend sa course vers le nord comme de Noël (en anglais Christmas), la naissance du Sauveur, oint pour nous sauver de la famine et du froid qui seraient notre lot s'il restait toujours au nadir.

En poursuivant sa course vers l'Equateur, le Soleil traverse le signe du Verseau, le porteur d'eau; à ce moment, la Terre est inondée de pluie, symbolisant le baptême du Sauveur. Puis au mois de mars, le Soleil traverse le signe des Poissons. Les provisions de l'année précédente ont été toutes consommées, et les ressources alimentaires de l'homme sont limitées, aussi avons-nous le long jeûne du Carême où l'on se nourrit de poisson, symbole de cette phase du voyage solaire. Ensuite vient lePassage, (Passover, en anglais) lorsque le Soleil passe (passes over, en anglais) l'équateur. C'est le temps de Pâques, (Easter, en anglais)lorsque le Soleil est à son noeud oriental, (eastern, en anglais)et ce croisement (crossing, en anglais) de l'équateur est symbolisé par la crucifixion (crossification ou crucifixion, en anglais) du Sauveur; le Soleil entre alors dans le signe du Bélier, et devient l'Agneau de Dieu donné pour le salut du monde, au temps où les plantes commencent à germer. Cependant, pour que ce sacrifice puisse être un bienfait pour l'homme, il (le Soleil) doit s'élever dans les cieux où ses rayons auront le pouvoir de mûrir le raisin et le blé, et nous avons alors la fête de l'Ascension du Sauveur jusqu'au Trône du Père, qui a lieu au solstice d'été, en Juin. Le Soleil y reste trois jours, et la promesse "De là il reviendra" se trouve réalisée lorsque le Soleil commence sa marche vers le noeud occidental. Au moment où il entre dans le signe de la Vierge, nous avons la fête de l'Assomption et plus tard, lorsqu'il quitte le signe de la Vierge, la nativité de la Vierge qui semble, pour ainsi dire, naître du Soleil.

La fête Juive des Tabernacles avait lieu à l'époque où le Soleil croisait l'équateur à son passage dans les mois d'hiver, et cette fête s'accompagnait du pesage du blé et de la récolte du raisin, dons du Dieu solaire à ses adorateurs humains.

C'est ainsi que toutes les fêtes de l'année se rattachent au mouvement des astres dans l'espace.

### <h3 id="question-90">Question 90</h3>

Vous avez dit, je crois, que le Christ ne s'était incarné qu'une fois, en Jésus; ne s'était-il pas incarné antérieurement en Gautama Bouddha, et, dans un passé plus reculé encore, en Krishna?

RÉPONSE - Non. Jésus est un esprit appartenant à notre évolution humaine, et il en est de même de Gautama Bouddha. L'auteur ne possède aucune information concernant Krishna, mais il est porté à croire qu'il était aussi un esprit appartenant à la race humaine, car les histoires Hindoues racontent comment il entra au ciel et ce qui lui advint. L'Esprit du Christ qui pénétra dans le corps de Jésus, lorsque celui-ci le Lui eut abandonné au baptême, était un rayon du Christ cosmique. Nous pouvons remonter dans les précédentes incarnations de Jésus, et suivre son développement jusqu'à nos jours. L'Esprit du Christ, au contraire, ne peut être retrouvé parmi les esprits humains.

Nous pouvons dire qu'avant Sa venue, le Christ travaillait notre planète de l'extérieur, à la manière dont les esprits-groupes travaillent de l'extérieur avec les animaux, les guidant, les assistant jusqu'à ce qu'ils deviennent suffisamment individualisés pour être la demeure d'un esprit individuel.La terre n'avait pas d'esprit intérieur avant la venue du Christ, mais au temps où le sacrifice fut consommé sur le Golgotha et que l'Esprit du Christ fut libéré du corps de Jésus, Il pénétra dans la Terre dont Il est maintenant l'Esprit Intérieur, "gémissant et souffrant attendant le jour de la libération", commme le dit Paul, (Romains 8/22), car, contrairement à l'opinion admise, le sacrifice sur le Golgotha ne s'est pas terminé avec la mort du corps de Jésus; en fait, on peut dire que cet événement n'en était que le début; le sacrifice continuera jusqu'au moment où nous aurons développé l'altruisme et l'amour qui libéreront l'Esprit de la Terre des conditions limitatives de l'existence matérielle, car alors il ne sera plus nécessaire de nous guider.

### <h3 id="question-91">Question 91</h3>

On nous dit que "Dieu a tant aimé le monde qu'Il a donné Son Fils unique, afin que quiconque croit en Lui ne périsse pas, mais qu'il ait la vie éternelle". Comment concilier cette idée avec les paroles du Christ, "Je ne suis pas venu apporter la paix, mais le glaive"?

RÉPONSE - On dit que "la loi et les prophètes ont existé jusqu'au Christ", et il y a quatre degrés par lesquels l'homme s'élève jusqu'à Dieu. Tout d'abord, lorsqu'il s'éveille à la conscience dans le Monde Physique et qu'il est à l'état sauvage, il se trouve entouré d'autres hommes qui, par la force des circonstances, sont obligés de lutter pour la vie, et pour lesquels "la force prime le droit"; là, il apprend à compter sur sa propre force pour triompher des attaques des animaux sauvages et des autres hommes. Mais il perçoit autour de lui les forces de la nature et il en a peur, car il sait qu'elles sont capables de tuer, et il se sent impuissant à leur tenir tête. C'est pourquoi il commence à adorer la puissance divine, cherchant par des sacrifices sanglants à apaiser le Dieu qu'il craint.

Puis vient le temps où il commence à voir en Dieu le dispensateur des choses, Celui qui le récompensera séance tenante de son obéissance à la loi ou le punira de sa désobéissance à celle-ci. Allié puissant contre ses ennemis, et tout aussi puissant ennemi, ce Dieu doit donc aussi être craint. Alors il Lui rend un culte et Lui sacrifie des animaux par crainte et par cupidité.

Ensuite vient le degré où on lui apprend à adorer un Dieu d'amour et à se sacrifier jour après jour, sa vie durant, en vue d'une récompense dans un état futur auquel il doit croire par la foi, et qui n'est pas clairement défini.

Enfin, l'homme atteindra un degré où il reconnaîtra sa divinité et fera le bien parce que c'est juste, sans pensée de crainte ou d'intérêt.

Le Juifs avaient atteint le deuxième de ces degrés et ils vivaient sous la loi. La religion Chrétienne en est au troisième degré, bien qu'elle ne soit pas entièrement affranchie du second. Nous sommes tous encore assujettis aux lois établies par Dieu et par les homme afin de discipliner nos corps du désir par la crainte; mais pour avancer spirituellement, nous devons désor mais sensibiliser notre corps vital qui répond à l'amour et n'a rien à voir avec la loi gouvernant la nature-désir.

Afin de préparer cet état à venir, les prêtres, plus avancés que le peuple, ont été séparés de ce dernier et tenus à l'écart. Nous savons qu'en Orient, une certaine caste seulement était admise dans les temples, celle des Brahamanes, pour y célébrer les services religieux. Parmi les Juifs, seuls les Lévites étaient autorisés à s'approcher du Lieu Saint, et il en était de même parmi les autres nations. Les prêtres ont toujours formé une classe distincte qui ne pouvait se marier avec le peuple. Ils étaient séparés des autres et se tenaient à part, à tous égards.

La raison en était que les guides de l'humanité ne pouvaient utiliser la descendance que là où existait un certain relâchement entre le corps vital et le corps dense. Ainsi, ils en faisaient une sorte d'élevage installant ces prêtres autour des temples, réglementant leur vie, sexuellement et en toute chose. Mais à l'époque où le Christ, libéré du corps de Jésus, eut diffusé Son Etre par toute la Terre, le voile du temple se déchira, symbole du fait que le besoin d'une condition spéciale était dépassé. Depuis ce temps, l'éther de la Terre va toujours en se modifiant. Un taux croissant de vibration permet l'expression de qualités altruistes. Ce fut le point de départ de ces puissantes vibrations qui ont provoqué l'obscurité dont il est dit qu'elle accompagna la crucifixion. En réalité, il ne s'agissait pas de ténèbres, mais d'une intense lumière qui aveugla les hommes jusqu'au moment où les vibrations se furent ralenties en pénétrant dans la terre physique dense. Quelques heures après, l'Esprit rayonnant du Christ avait pénétré assez avant dans notre planète pour y rétablir des conditions normales. Et graduellement cette force intérieure gagne en influence, et les vibrations éthériques s'accélèrent, augmentant l'altruisme et favorisant la croissance spirituelle. De là vient que les conditions sont maintenant telles qu'il n'est plus besoin de classe spéciale ou privilégiée, mais que chacun peut aspirer à entrer dans le sentier de l'initiation.

Pourtant, les anciennes conditions disparaissent difficilement; sous le régime de Jéhovah, Esprit de la Lune, l'humanité avait été divisée en nations, et pour les guider, Jéhovah avait dû, de temps à autre, se servir d'une nation pour en punir une autre, car l'humanité d'alors n'était pas accessible à l'amour et n'obéissait que sous le coup de la crainte. Avant que ne soit instituée la grande Fraternité Universelle d'Amour, il est nécessaire de fragmenter ces nations, selon le même principe qui fait que, si l'on a un certain nombre de petites constructions et que l'on désire en faire un seul bâtiment, il faudra les fragmenter avant de pouvoir en utiliser chacune des briques pour le nouvel édifice plus grand. C'est pourquoi le Christ a dit, "Je ne suis pas venu apporter la paix, mais le glaive."

Nous devons aller au-delà du patriotisme, et apprendre à dire, comme Thomas Paine, "Le monde est ma patrie, faire le bien est ma religion." Tant que cela ne sera pas, les guerres auront lieu, et plus il y en aura, mieux cela vaudra, parce qu'alors l'horreur de la guerre deviendra suffisamment grande pour que la paix s'impose.

Dans la nuit sainte de Noël où naquit l'Enfant Jésus, les Anges ont chanté "Paix sur la terre aux hommes de bonne volonté." Plus tard, lorsque l'enfant eut grandi, Il dit "Je ne suis pas venu apporter la paix, mais le glaive"; or la religion Chrétienne a été la plus sanglante de toutes les religions de l'humanité. Elle a apporté douleurs et désolation avec elle et où qu'elle ait été; mais après ces luttes viendra le jour où l'idéal de paix que proclamait le chant des Anges et les paroles du Christ, "Aimez-vous les uns les autres" deviendront une réalité vécue. Quand les épées auront fait leur travail, on en fera des socs de charrue, et il n'y aura plus de guerres, car il n'y aura plus de nations.

### <h3 id="question-92">Question 92</h3>

Qu'entend-on par salut et damnation éternels?

RÉPONSE - Les religions traditionnelles disent que ceux qui ont fait le bien dans cette vie sont sauvés, c'est-à-dire qu'ils iront au ciel, pas très clairement défini, et ceux qui ne sont pas sauvés sont plongés dans un enfer dont on ne sait pas grand-chose, sinon que c'est un lieu de souffrances. Les bons et les méchants restent dans leurs places respectives, une fois qu'ils ont été jugés: il n'y a pas de rédemption pour les âmes perdues, et plus de danger de chute pour ceux qui ont été sauvés une fois pour toutes.

Une telle interprétation est radicalement fausse si l'on se réfère à un dictionnaire de la langue Grecque pour obtenir la signification du mot traduit par "éternel". Ce mot est "aionian", et dans le dictionnaire il est traduit par "un âge, une période indéfinie, la durée d'une vie" etc. Quel est, alors, le vrai sens du passage cité? Pour le trouver, il est nécessaire de se faire une idée d'ensemble de la vie.

Au commencement de la manifestation, Dieu, flamme immense, différencie un nombre infini de flammes naissantes ou étincelles, en Lui-même, non pas en dehors de Lui-même, car c'est un fait acquis que "en Lui nous avons la Vie, le Mouvement et l'Etre". Rien ne peut exister en dehors de Dieu. Ainsi donc, en Lui-même, Dieu différencie ces âmes innombrables. Chacune est divine en puissance, chacune renferme tous Ses pouvoirs comme la graine renferme la plante. Or, de même que la graine doit être enfouie dans le sol pour produire la plante, ainsi est-il nécessaire que ces étincelles divines soient revêtues de véhicules matériels afin de pouvoir apprendre certaines leçons qui ne peuvent être apprises à fond que dans une existence distincte, telle celle que nous avons sur cette terre.

On peut considérer le monde comme une école préparatoire pour les esprits qui évoluent. Certains d'entre eux ont commencé de bonne heure et se sont appliqués à leur tâche plus diligemment que les autres; en conséquence, ils ont progressé rapidement. D'autres ont commencé plus tard, et sont des retardataires. Ils sont laissés en arrière; mais, tous finiront par atteindre la perfection. Il y a donc plusieurs classes de ces esprits pèlerins, et avant qu'une classe de ces derniers puissent être promus à un échelon supérieur de l'évolution, il faut qu'ils aient atteint un certain degré de compétence. Ils sont sauvés de leur condition inférieure lorsqu'ils l'ont dépassée. Une fois que ce niveau de compétence a été acquis, ils sont promus dans une autre race lors d'une époque ultérieure. Mais parmi un grand nombre d'êtres, il y a toujours des retardataires, et ils sont condamnés à rester dans la classe où ils se trouvent, jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient arrivés au stade de croissance requis pour leur avancement. Ce plan est similaire aux méthodes en usage dans nos écoles, où les élèves sont promus dans la classe supérieure, à l'occasion des examens annuels s'ils ont atteint un certain niveau de connaissances; si ce n'est pas le cas, il sont condamnés à rester en arrière, non pas pour toujours, mais seulement jusqu'à ce qu'un autre examen annuel prouve qu'ils ont acquis leur qualification.

Ce qui précède n'est pas une interprétation déformée ou erronée de la signification du mot "aïônian". Ce mot a été employé dans d'autres passages de la Bible qui appuient fortement notre thèse. Par exemple, dans la Lettre de Paul à Philémon, lorsque Paul renvoie à ce dernier l'esclave Onésime, nous relevons ces mots, "Peut-être Onésime n'a-t-il été séparé de toi pour un temps que pour qu'il te soit rendu pour toujours". L'expression "pour toujours" correspond au même mot "aïônian", traduit par "éternel" dans les passages où il est question de damnation et de salut; dans le passage qui nous occupe, on se rendra évidemment compte qu'il ne peut être question que d'une partie de la vie, puisque ni Paul ni Philémon, en tant qu'hommes, ne pouvaient vivre "éternellement".

### <h3 id="question-93">Question 93</h3>

Quel est l'enseignement des Rosicruciens concernant l'Immaculée Conception?

RÉPONSE - La Doctrine de l'Immaculée Conception est, peut-être, l'un des mystères les plus sublimes de la religion Chrétienne, et c'est probablement la raison pour laquelle elle a souffert plus qu'aucun autre mystère d'être traînée dans la matérialité. Elle a souffert autant de l'interprétation de ses partisans maladroits, que des sarcasmes des sceptiques. Lorsque, par exemple, nous voyons dans une église un tableau représentant Dieu sous les traits d'un vieillard assis sur des nuages, un chalumeau à la bouche, en train de souffler l'enfant Jésus dans le flanc de Marie, la chose est plus que ridicule, elle est navrante!

L'idée populaire, mais erronée, est qu'il y a environ deux mille ans, un personnage appelé Jésus-Christ naquit d'une mère, sans la coopération d'un père terrestre, et cet événement est considéré comme unique dans l'histoire du monde. En réalité, il n'est pas sans précédent; la conception immaculée a eu lieu bien des fois dans l'histoire du monde, et elle deviendra universelle dans l'avenir.

L'histoire de l'humanité est écrite par anticipation dans les astres, l'homme étant le petit monde, ou microcosme, et les astres, le grand monde, ou macrocosme. Là, l'idéal, le prototype de l'Immaculée Conception est représenté d'année en année de façon très spectaculaire. Le Soleil est le donneur de vie du monde; il est aussi la lumière du monde. Et de même que les êtres les plus avancés, sauveurs de l'humanité, apparaissent lorsque les plus grandes ténèbres spirituelles enveloppent la terre, ainsi le Soleil renaît au solstice d'hiver et commence son voyage vers l'équateur dans la nuit la plus sombre de l'année, entre le 24 et 25 décembre. A ce moment de l'année, le signe zodiacal de la Vierge se lève à l'horizon oriental dans toutes les latitudes septentrionales, qui sont les plus peuplées de la Terre.

Ainsi, la lumière du monde est chaque année conçue de façon immaculée par la vierge-mère céleste, et elle commence son voyage vers le nord et donne sa vie pour l'humanité en mûrissant le blé et le raisin. Par analogie, les maîtres spirituels naissent à des périodes où les ténèbres de l'esprit sont les plus profondes, et ils donnent à l'homme le pain de vie qui nourrit l'âme.

On ne récolte pas le raisin sur des ronces, et un proverbe dit, "Tel père, tel fils"; une entité vile doit naître d'une mère vile, et avant qu'un Sauveur puisse naître, une vierge-mère pure doit être trouvée. Mais lorsque nous disons "vierge", nous ne voulons pas dire vierge au sens physique. Nous possédons tous la virginité physique dans les premières années de notre vie, mais la virginité de l'esprit est une qualité d'âme acquise par des vies de pensées pures et de nobles aspirations. Cette qualité ne dépend pas de l'état du corps physique. Une véritable vierge peut avoir plusieurs enfants et rester "vierge".

Qu'un enfant soit conçu dans le péché ou de façon immaculée dépend donc de la qualité inhérente de son âme, car si l'Ego qui doit naître est pur et chaste, il naîtra certainement d'une mère qui a la même nature pure et belle. Et l'acte physique qui, chez la plupart, est dicté par la passion et le désir pour la satisfaction des sens, est accompli, par l'âme chaste et pure, en esprit de prière et comme un sacrifice. Ainsi, l'enfant est conçu sans le péché passionnel; il est conçu de façon immaculée.

Une telle naissance n'est jamais fortuite. Sa venue est annoncée et attendue avec une anticipation de bonheur et de joie, et il y a actuellement beaucoup de cas qui se rapprochent de la Conception Immaculée, où les deux parents, pures et chastes, accomplissent l'acte générateur dans un esprit de pur amour; la mère est ensuite laissée en paix pendant la période de gestation et l'enfant naît alors d'une manière presque aussi pure que celle qui est figurée dans les conceptions immaculées symboliques. Avec le temps, lorsque l'humanité aura développé des qualités de plus en plus altruistes, la passion sera remplacée par l'amour pur, et tous les humains seront conçus d'une façon immaculée.

L'Etoile de Bethléem n'était-elle pas une comète?

RÉPONSE - Non, car chaque nuit, l'Etoile de Bethléem brille à minuit tout comme elle brillait dans le récit biblique, et elle peut être vue par les sages d'aujourd'hui, alors qu'elle reste cachée pour les autres. Cette étoile n'est autre que le Soleil spirituel d'où vient l'impulsion de l'Esprit du Christ Cosmique.

Voilà la clé de ce mystère:

Les Evangiles ne relatent pas uniquement l'histoire de la vie d'un grand être et de ses disciples. Par le moyen d'images et de symboles, ils dépeignent les incidents qui attendent les futurs initiés sur le sentier de la connaissance; ce sont en réalité des formulaires d'initiation.

Pendant l'été, lorsque la Terre se met à l'oeuvre pour produire le pain de vie pour ceux qui l'habitent, le Soleil, qui envoie ses rayons vivifiants vers notre planète, est très haut dans le ciel. Toutes les activités physiques s'exercent alors à l'extrême, et l'homme est absorbé dans les occupations matérielles nécessaires à son existence. Mais lorsqu'en hiver, le Soleil est au-dessous de l'équateur et que la nature sommeille, les influences spirituelles qu'il émet sont des plus puissantes. Lorsque l'obscurité physique augmente, la lumière spirituelle est plus brillante et elle atteint son point culminant à la naissance des "Sauveurs", dans la nuit la plus sombre de l'année, entre le 24 et le 25 décembre, au moment où le Soleil commence son voyage vers le nord pour sauver l'humanité du froid et de la famine qui résulteraient s'il restait dans les latitudes australes.

Dans cette nuit particulière de l'année les vibrations spirituelles sont les plus fortes.De toute l'année, c'est la Nuit Sainte par excellence. Celle où le néophyte peut le plus facilement entrer en contact conscient avec les vibrations spirituelles. C'est pourquoi les néophytes entraient jadis dans les temples en cette Nuit Sainte. Ils étaient mis en état de transe sous la direction de Mages qui leur apprenaient à quitter leur corps, consciemment, par un acte de volonté. La Terre devenait alors transparente à leurs yeux et ils voyaient derrière elle le Soleil de minuit, l'astre flamboyant. Non pas le Soleil physique, mais le Soleil spirituel qui est la véritable étoile du Christ, car le Christ cosmique est l'Initié le plus sublime parmi les radieux Archanges, esprits du Soleil.

### <h3 id="question-95">Question 95</h3>

Quels étaient les dons des Mages?

RÉPONSE - La Bible nous dit que ces dons étaient l'or, la myrrhe et l'encens.

L'or a toujours été considéré dans les vieilles légendes et dans la symbologie comme l'emblème de l'esprit. Dans l'histoire de l'"Anneau des Niebelungen", dont Wagner a fait un drame lyrique, les filles du Rhin jouent dans l'eau, leur élément naturel, au fond du fleuve. L'eau est illuminée par l'éclat de l'or. Cette légende nous reporte au temps où les enfants du brouillard vivaient dans les merveilleuses conditions de l'Atlantide primitive, alors qu'ils formaient une grande fraternité, innocente et semblable à des enfants, et que l'Esprit Universel n'avait pas encore pénétré dans des corps séparés.

L'or reposant sur le roc au fond de l'eau était le symbole de l'Esprit Universel illuminant l'humanité tout entière. Plus tard, il est volé, fondu en un anneau par Alberich, le Niebelung, qui renie l'amour pour posséder l'or. Celui-ci devient alors le symbole de l'Ego séparé, à notre époque actuelle qui est sans amour et faite d'égoïsme. L'homme qui est devenu sage et qui voit les maux qu'engendre l'égoïsme, offre l'or au Christ comme symbole de son désir du retour à l'esprit Universel d'Amour.

Le second présent, la myrrhe, est une plante aromatique très rare qui croît en Arabie. Elle est le symbole de l'âme. On nous dit dans les légendes des saints que ceux qui avaient été particulièrement saints émettaient un parfum. Il ne s'agit pas là d'une fable pieuse, mais il est un fait certain, c'est qu'un grand saint émet le plus admirable parfum.

Le troisième don, l'encens, est le symbole du corps physique rendu éthéré par une vie sainte, car l'encens est une fumée physique. Le Ministre de l'Intérieur de Serbie, un des conspirateurs du régicide du 11 juin 1903 a, depuis, écrit ses mémoires. Il raconte que, lorsque les conspirateurs brûlaient de l'encens au moment où ils invitaient d'autres personnes à se joindre à eux, ils réussissaient invariablement à les gagner à leur cause. Le ministre n'en connaissait pas la raison, et n'y voyait qu'une coïncidence curieuse. Pour l'occultiste, cette raison est claire.

Aucun esprit ne peut travailler dans un monde s'il n'a un véhicule composé de la matière de ce monde. Pour fonctionner dans le Monde Physique, pour y agir, nous devons avoir un corps dense et un corps vital; tous deux sont faits de matière physique de qualités différentes que sont les solides, les liquides, les gaz et les éthers. Nous pouvons nous procurer ces véhicules de la façon normale, en passant par le sein d'une femme, ou bien extraire du corps d'un médium de l'éther employé temporairement pour nous matérialiser, ou encore nous pouvons employer la fumée de l'encens. Dans l'Eglise Catholique, où l'on invoque certains esprits, l'encens fournit le véhicule grâce auquel les esprits peuvent influencer leur congrégation, à la manière dont les esprits désincarnés ont favorisé les régicides Serbes.

Ainsi, nous voyons que les dons des Mages étaient l'esprit, l'âme et le corps, consacrés au service de l'humanité. Se dévouer pour elle, c'est imiter le Christ, c'est marcher sur Ses traces.

### <h3 id="question-96">Question 96</h3>

Jésus n'était-Il pas Juif? S'il en est ainsi, que voulait-Il dire par ces mots, "Avant qu'Abraham fût, je suis"? Car, quand bien même Il se serait réincarné, Abraham est le père de la race Juive.

RÉPONSE - Dans les temps anciens, et même de nos jours, le patriotisme est considéré comme une vertu de premier ordre; mais au point de vue occulte, il n'y a que l'Esprit Un, et les races ne sont qu'une phase éphémère du plan de l'évolution; c'est en fait, une phase très dangereuse, car tandis que pendant les Périodes et les grandes Epoques de l'évolution on dispose de temps en abondance, et qu'il est possible aux Guides d'aider la plupart des esprits à se préparer à franchir le degré suivant, les races et les nations naissent et meurent dans une durée comparativement si courte que certains esprits courent le danger de rester liés à des corps de leur race et ne puissent suivre la masse de l'humanité dans ses progrès.

C'est précisément ce qui est arrivé aux Juifs. Ils sont si intensément patriotes qu'aucun Juif pense qu'il est lui-même un individu. Tout d'abord, utilisant le terme le plus élevé, il parlait de lui-même comme étant "descendant d'Abraham". Secondairement, il se considérait comme appartenant à une certaine tribu; en dernier lieu, peut-être, il était Salomon Lévi, ou Moïse Cohen.

Le Christ a combattu cette idée d'identité avec la race lorsqu'Il dit, "Avant qu'Abraham fût, je suis". L'Ego existait avant Abraham; Abraham était une incarnation d'un Ego, un Esprit. Lui, et la race Juive descendant de lui, étaient simplement des corps, mais les Egos qui les habitaient existaient avant les corps de race. C'est ainsi que le Christ conseillait à ses auditeurs de s'élever de l'éphémère à l'éternel.

Dans un autre passage de la Bible, Il dit, "A moins qu'un homme ne quitte son père et sa mère, il ne peut Me suivre". Les pères et les mères sont aussi des corps de race. Nous n'avons pas le droit de quitter des parents qui dépendent de nous, pour suivre la vie supérieure; nous devons accomplir tous nos devoirs terrestres avant d'entreprendre égoïstement l'étude de la vie supérieure, mais nous ne devons pas nous identifier avec la race, la nation, ou la famille dans lesquelles nous sommes nés. Chacun de nous est un esprit individuel qui existait avant les corps que nous appelons races, et qui existera après que ces formes auront cessé d'être. Faute de garder cette idée à l'esprit, nous risquons de nous cristalliser et de rester avec la race au lieu de progresser, tels les Juifs. Leur intense patriotisme a été la cause de leur renaissance, en tant qu'esprits, dans des corps de race Juive pendant des milliers d'années.

Les guides de l'humanité ont cherché différents moyens qui inciteraient les Juifs à se mélanger aux autres, afin de pouvoir progresser, mais toujours en vain, et le Christ leur a été envoyé pour la même raison que Booker T. Washington l'a été pour aider les Noirs. Quoique plus avancé que ses frères de race, il s'est incarné dans un corps de Noir afin de pouvoir aider ses frères Noirs d'une manière plus efficace. S'il s'était né dans un corps Blanc, sa mission aurait eu un caractère paternaliste. C'est pour la même raison que le Christ a choisi un corps Juif. On pouvait espérer que la nation juive recevrait Ses enseignements, puisque ceux-ci venaient d'un homme de leur race. Mais, loin d'honorer leurs traditions et de considérer Abraham avec une attitude d'esprit révérencieuse, Il a rabaissé leurs idéaux, Il parla de nouveaux Cieux et d'une nouvelle Terre, Il affirma la supériorité de l'individu sur la race, et c'est pourquoi ils n'en ont pas voulu et ont " choisi Barabbas".

### <h3 id="question-97">Question 97</h3>

Jésus fut baptisé à trente ans, recevant l'Esprit du Christ. Voulez-vous bien nous expliquer ce baptême?

RÉPONSE - La Terre n'a pas toujours été ce qu'elle est de nos jours. La science nous apprend qu'il fut un temps où elle était un brouillard de feu. La Bible remonte même plus loin et parle d'un temps antérieur à ce brouillard, lorsque la Terre devint embrasée et lumineuse comme un feu; et d'un autre temps plus reculé encore, où régnaient les ténèbres.

Il y a eu en tout quatre époques ou phases dans ce développement de la Terre. Premièrement, il y eut la phase des ténèbres qui est appelée, dans la terminologie Rosicrucienne, l'Epoque Polaire. La substance qui forme maintenant la Terre était alors une masse sombre, brûlante et gazeuse. A la deuxième phase, appelée Epoque Hyperboréenne, cette masse sombre s'embrasa. "Dieu dit, Que la lumière soit! Et la lumière fut." Vint ensuite la troisième phase où le brouillard de feu, mis en contact avec l'espace froid, produisit de l'humidité qui, plus dense près du noyau igné, se condensa en vapeur qui s'échappait du centre vers l'extérieur. "Dieu divisa les eaux d'avec les eaux", c'est-à-dire l'eau dense, plus près du noyau, de la vapeur légère de l'extérieur. Finalement, à la quatrième phase, il se produisit une cristallisation telle que celle qui se dépose lorsque l'eau est bouillie maintes et maintes fois dans un récipient, et c'est ainsi que s'est formée la croûte terrestre, le terrain sec.

Lorsque fut terminée la formation de cette croûte, il n'y avait pas d'eau sur la surface de la terre; mais, comme le dit la Bible, "un brouillard s'élevait de sa surface", et aucune herbe n'avait encore poussé. A ce moment, cependant, la végétation commença d'apparaître, et l'humanité naissante vivait là. Mais cette humanité n'était pas constituée comme elle l'est de nos jours.La forme de leur corps était très différente et eux-mêmes étaient loin d'être aussi évolués que nous le sommes maintenant. En fait, le corps et l'esprit n'étaient pas encore parfaitement réunis; l'esprit planait en partie en dehors du corps et c'est pourquoi "les yeux de l'homme n'étaient pas encore ouverts".

Les vieilles légendes Germaniques donnent aux humains de ce temps-là le nom de Niebelungen. "Niebel" signifie brouillard, et "ungen" enfants. Ils étaient les "enfants du brouillard", car l'atmosphère claire d'aujourd'hui n'existait pas; à cause de la densité du brouillard qui s'élevait de la terre, le Soleil ressemblait à la lumière d'un réverbère dans une nuit très brumeuse.

L'humanité de ce temps-là n'était pas aussi avancée mentalement qu'elle l'est de nos jours. Les hommes ne pouvaient voir les choses en dehors d'eux-mêmes, mais ils avaient une perception intérieure. Ils voyaient les qualités de l'âme de ceux qui vivaient autour d'eux et se percevaient eux-mêmes comme étant spirituel plutôt que matériel. Il n'y avait pas alors de nations, l'humanité était une grande fraternité. L'esprit étant partiellement en dehors du corps, les humains étaient, par conséquent, en contact avec l'Esprit Universel qui, à notre époque, a été obscurci par la séparativité de l'égotisme, lequel fait que chacun se sent distinct et à part de tout le reste de l'humanité; là où la fraternité est oubliée l'égoïsme gouverne en maître.

Lorsqu'un homme a suffisamment progressé pour apprécier les bénédictions de la fraternité, quand il s'efforce d'abolir l'égotisme et de cultiver l'altruisme, il peut passer par le rite du baptême. Il entre dans l'eau pour symboliser son retour aux conditions idéales de la fraternité qui existaient lorsque l'humanité vivait, pour ainsi dire, dans cet élément. C'est pourquoi nous voyons Jésus, héraut de la Fraternité Universelle, entrer, au début de son ministère, dans les eaux du Jourdain et y recevoir le baptême. Lorsqu'il sortit de l'eau, l'Esprit Universel se posa sur Lui sous forme d'une colombe et, à partir de ce moment, il ne fut plus simplement Jésus, mais Jésus-Christ, devenu Sauveur, en puissance, du monde, pénétré de l'Esprit Universel qui enlèvera finalement tous les maux dus à l'égoïsme et redonnera au genre humain les bénédictions de la fraternité, ce qui se réalisera lorsque l'Esprit Universel sera devenu immanent dans toute l'humanité.

### <h3 id="question-98">Question 98</h3>

Dans votre enseignement vous déclarez que nous restons durant un certain temps, environ un tiers de l'existence terrestre, au Purgatoire, avant d'entrer dans le Premier Ciel, afin d'y expier nos péchés. Comment conciliez- vous cela avec les paroles du Christ au larron mourant, "Aujourd'hui, tu seras avec moi au Paradis"?

RÉPONSE - Le Nouveau Testament a été écrit en Grec, langue dans laquelle il n'était fait usage d'aucun signe de ponctuation. Ces signes ont été ajoutés dans la Bible par les traducteurs. Or, il arrive souvent que la ponctuation change radicalement le sens d'une phrase. 

In a prayer meeting some one handed in a request which the pastor read thus: "A sailor going to sea, his mother-in-law desires the prayers of the congregation for his safe return to wife and child." The request was not punctuated at all, but would imply that the young man's mother-in-law was very solicitous to have him return safely to his wife and child and therefore desired the prayers of the congregation. Had the pastor read it without the comma, it would have implied that the sailor, going to see his mother-in-law, desired the prayers of the congregation for his safe return to wife and child, and one would naturally think that the lady in question must be a Tartar when it was necessary for the young man to ask the prayers of the congregation before facing her. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, si les mots du Christ étaient ainsi ponctués, "En vérité, je te le dis aujourd'hui, tu seras avec moi au Paradis", ils signifieraient que le voleur serait avec Lui au Paradis dans un avenir indéterminé. Mais la virgule ayant été placée devant le mot aujourd'hui, ces mots donnent le sens généralement adopté.

Que ce sens soit absolument erroné est prouvé par la remarque que le Christ a faite à la femme, après Sa résurrection, "Ne me touche pas, car je ne suis pas encore retourné vers mon Père." S'Il avait promis au larron qu'il serait avec Lui au Paradis le jour même de la crucifixion et que, trois jours plus tard, Il ait déclaré ne pas y être encore allé, Il se serait contredit, ce qui, bien entendu, est impossible. La virgule, placée à l'endroit proposé, concilie les deux passages de la Bible, d'autant plus que Pierre nous dit que, dans l'intervalle, Il est allé au Purgatoire pour y assister des esprits (I Pierre 3:19).

### <h3 id="question-99">Question 99</h3>

Quelle est la signification ésotérique des deux larrons et de la croix?

RÉPONSE - Contrairement à l'opinion généralement admise, les quatre Evangiles ne sont pas simplement la biographie de Jésus-Christ; ce sont des formulaires d'initiation de quatre différentes Ecoles des Mystères, et c'est afin d'en voiler le sens ésotérique que la vie et le ministère du Christ y sont mêlés. Cela était facile, car tous les initiés, étant des personnages cosmiques, ont des expériences semblables. S'adressant à la foule, le Christ parle en paraboles, mais Il en révèle le côté caché à Ses disciples. Paul donnait, lui aussi, le "lait" au faibles, et la "nourriture solide" aux forts (I Corinthiens 3:1-2; Hébreux 5:12-14). Il n'a jamais été question de révéler les symboles cachés à la multitude, ni de faire de la Bible "un livre ouvert de Dieu", comme on le croit à notre époque.

En lisant dans la Mémoire de la Nature, nous trouvons qu'au moment de la crucifixion, il n'y avait pas seulement deux autres hommes crucifiés. En ce temps-là, la peine de mort était infligée pour la moindre offense, et il y avait toujours un grand nombre d'hommes condamnés à cette mort barbare. Ainsi, ceux qui désiraient voiler la signification cachée des Evangiles n'étaient pas embarrassés pour trouver quelques détails propres à compléter l'histoire de la crucifixion et à en obscurcir les points vraiment vitaux. Cette partie du récit concernant les larrons est un pur incident et n'a aucune signification ésotérique.

### <h3 id="question-100">Question 100</h3>

Quelle est la signification de la croix? Est-elle simplement un instrument de torture, ainsi que l'enseigne la religion traditionnelle?

RÉPONSE - Comme tous les autres symboles, la croix a de nombreuses significations. Platon nous en donne une lorsqu'il dit que "l'âme du Monde est crucifiée" - entendant par là les quatre règnes de la nature: minéral, végétal, animal et humain.

Le règne minéral contient toutes les substances chimiques, de quelque nature qu'elles soient. Ainsi, la croix, de quelque matière qu'elle soit, est tout d'abord un symbole de ce règne.

La partie inférieure du montant vertical de la croix symbolise le règne végétal, parce que les courants des esprits-groupes qui donnent la vie aux plantes proviennent du centre de la Terre où ces mêmes esprits-groupes sont situés et, de là, rayonnent vers la périphérie de notre planète, puis dans l'espace.

La partie supérieure de la croix est le symbole de l'homme, parce que les courants de vie du règne humain descendent du Soleil, à travers la colonne vertébrale. Ainsi, l'homme est la plante invertie, car la plante prend sa nourriture par la racine et la fait monter; l'homme la prend par la tête et la fait descendre. La plante est chaste, pure et sans passion, et déploie son organe créateur, la fleur, image de beauté et d'enchantement, chastement et sans honte, en direction du Soleil. L'homme tourne son organe générateur rempli de passion en direction de la terre; l'homme aspire l'oxygène donneur de vie et expire l'acide carbonique qui est un poison. La plante absorbe le poison exhalé par l'homme, en bâtit son corps, et nous rend l'élixir de vie, l'oxygène purifié.

Entre la plante et l'homme se tient l'animal, à la colonne vertébrale horizontale par où passent les courants de vie de l'esprit-groupe qui font le tour de notre globe, aussi le bras horizontal de la croix est-il le symbole du règne animal.

En ésotérisme, la croix n'est jamais considérée comme un instrument de torture, et ce n'est qu'à partir du sixième siècle que l'on a représenté le Christ crucifié. Jusque-là, le symbole du Christ était une croix avec un agneau couché à ses pieds, ce qui exprimait l'idée qu'à la naissance du Christ, le Soleil, à l'équinoxe de printemps, croisait l'équateur dans la constellation du Bélier. Les symboles de toutes les religions ont toujours été établis de cette manière. Au temps où le Soleil, par précession, passait l'équinoxe de printemps dans la constellation du Taureau, une religion fut instituée en Egypte, dans laquelle un culte était rendu au boeuf Apis, à la manière dont nous rendons un culte à l'Agneau de Dieu. A une époque beaucoup plus reculée, le Dieu Nordique Thor conduisait ses chèvres jumelles à travers les cieux. C'était l'époque où l'équinoxe du printemps était dans la constellation des Gémeaux. Au moment de la naissance de Jésus, l'équinoxe du printemps occupait le septième degré environ du Bélier; c'est pourquoi notre Sauveur a été appelé l'Agneau de Dieu. Dans les premiers siècles de notre ère,il y eut une dispute concernant la justesse d'avoir un un agneau comme symbole de notre Sauveur. Quelques-uns alléguaient que l'équinoxe de printemps, à Sa naissance, était en réalité dans le signe des Poissons, et que le symbole de notre Sauveur aurait dû être un poisson. C'est en mémoire de cette discussion que la mitre des évêques a la forme d'une tête de poisson.

### <h3 id="question-101">Question 101</h3>

La mission du Christ n'aurait-elle pas pu être accomplie sans le mode violent de la crucifixion?

RÉPONSE - Elle aurait évidemment pu s'accomplir sans le mode spécifique de la crucifixion, mais il était d'une absolue nécessité que le sang coule. Il y a des Instructeurs de différents degrés, et ils requièrent chacun des conditions différentes pour l'accomplissement de leur tâche. Certains, comme Moïse et Bouddha, sont venus aider une nation jusqu'à un certain point en travaillant ainsi eux-mêmes à leur avancement; ces deux Instructeurs sont parvenus à un degré de leur développement où leur corps est devenu lumineux. Nous savons que le visage de Moïse brillait de telle manière qu'il lui fallait le couvrir d'un voile. Le Bouddha est devenu lumineux au moment de sa mort. Le Christ a atteint le degré de luminosité au moment de Sa transfiguration, et il est très significatif que la partie la plus importante de Son oeuvre, Sa passion et Sa mort, ont eu lieu après cet événement de la transfiguration. Et tandis que Moïse, Elie, Bouddha et autres Instructeurs antérieurs au Christ ont dû renaître à différentes reprises pour pouvoir porter sur eux les péchés de leurs peuples, le Christ n'est apparu qu'une seule fois dans un corps physique, et Il n'aura jamais plus besoin de s'entourer d'un tel véhicule. Car lorsque l'esprit quitte le corps de la manière naturelle, il emporte avec lui certaines impuretés lorsqu'il se retire lentement du sang coagulé. Même dans un corps aussi pur que ce lui de Jésus, il y avait des impuretés, et la mort violente qui fit couler le sang de ce corps libéra l'Ego du Christ par un prompt arrachement, laissant derrière Lui ce qu'il pouvait y avoir d'impureté, si bien que le Christ sortit du corps de Jésus, sans tache et sans l'entrave d'une destinée inhérente au corps physique.

C'est ainsi que les guerres d'à présent, bien que regrettables humainement parlant, purifient considérablement le sang de la race, ainsi que l'ont constaté les occultistes, en sorte que les humains deviennent de moins en moins passionnés et de plus en plus spirituels. On peut dire que ce même phénomène de purification fait apparaître une contrepartie au massacre des animaux. Lorsque l'humanité passait par la phase animale, elle n'avait pas de sang rouge rempli de passion comme l'ont les animaux de notre temps; nous n'étions pas aussi évolués qu'ils le sont. Bien qu'ils soient placés actuellement plus bas que nous sur l'échelle de l'évolution, les animaux d'à présent sont sur une plus haute spirale que nous ne l'étions, et tandis que nous souffrons en vertu de la loi de cause à effet afin de triompher de nos passions par nos propres moyens, les animaux sont aidés et surveillés par leurs esprits-groupes. Lorsqu'ils auront atteint la phase humaine dans la Période de Jupiter, ils formeront une humanité supérieure à la nôtre, exempte des passions qui ont fait de ce monde un lieu de douleurs. Ainsi, la nature transmue toujours le mal que nous faisons en un plus grand bien.

En réponse à la question qui nous occupe, nous pouvons dire que, dans le cas du Christ, une mort violente était nécessaire parce qu'elle a mis le Christ à même de se retirer du corps de Jésus sans retenir aucune des impuretés attachées à un véhicule qui n'était qu'humain.

### <h3 id="question-102">Question 102</h3>

Quand le Christ doit-Il revenir sur la terre, selon l'enseignement Rosicrucien?

RÉPONSE - La Bible dit avec raison que "nul ne connaît le jour ni l'heure", et ceux qui ont essayé de fixer une date ou une certaine année au Second Avènement se sont complètement mépris sur l'objet de la mission du Christ. Son enseignement a été donné à l'humanité afin d'abolir la loi du talion "oeil pour oeil, dent pour dent", et de remplacer la loi de la crainte (de Dieu) par la loi d'amour. "La loi et les prophètes ont prévalu jusqu'à la venue du Christ" est-il dit, mais nous savons que même aujourd'hui la loi demeure, et qu'elle est nécessaire. Il est donc évident qu'elle n'a pas été abolie à la venue du Christ sur terre. C'est la venue du Christ "intérieur", dans la nature intérieure de l'homme, qui doit abolir la loi. Paul parle de cet événement comme du "Christ formé en vous (II Corinthiens 13:5; Galates 4:19) et jusqu'à ce que le Christ ait été formé en nous, nous ne sommes pas prêts pour le Second Avènement. Comme nous le dit si bien Angelus Silesius:

```
"Le Christ serait-Il né mille fois à Bethléem, 
S'Il ne naît en toi ton âme est solitaire. 
La croix du Golgotha tu contemples en vain, 
Si toi-même en ton coeur tu ne l'élèves point."
```

Le Second Avènement du Christ dépend du temps où un nombre suffisant de personnes seront devenues semblables au Christ, en harmonie avec le principe Christique, de sorte que, comme deux diapasons de même hauteur de ton résonnent à l'unisson lorsque l'un d'eux est mis en vibration, elles soient capables de répondre aux vibrations Christiques mises en jeu par le retour du Sauveur. C'est pourquoi la venue de cet événement ne peut être calculée, mais chaque fois que nous nous efforçons d'imiter le Christ et de mettre en pratique Ses enseignements, nous hâtons Sa venue.

### <h3 id="question-103">Question 103</h3>

Qu'entend-on par, "Le Christ fut fait à jamais grand-prêtre de l'ordre de Melchisedech"?

RÉPONSE - On nous dit que Melchisedech était roi de Salem et aussi son grand- prêtre; que son sacerdoce était bien au-dessus de celui d'Aaron, car il était inamovible, tandis que celui d'Aaron et des Lévites était sujet à de fréquents changements. 

Pendant les siècles dont l'histoire nous fournit les annales, il y a toujours eu une division entre le pouvoir temporel et le pouvoir ecclésiastique. Moïse était le chef temporel du peuple Juif, tandis qu'Aaron en était le prêtre et veillait à son bien-être spirituel. Et cette division de l'Eglise et de l'Etat est restée manifeste, causant de temps à autre des luttes et des effusions de sang, car leurs intérêts ont toujours paru diamétralement opposés. Mais au temps de Melchisedech (Genèse 14:18; Psaume 110:4; Hébreux, chapitres 5 à 7), roi de Salem , mot qui signifie paix, cette division n'existait pas, le même homme remplissant les deux offices. L'histoire de Melchisedech, un Etre sans généalogie terrestre, se rapporte, naturellement, aux premiers temps de l'Atlantide, alors que l'humanité n'avait pas encore été divisée en nations guerrières, mais formait une grande fraternité pacifique dont les chefs étaient des Etres Divins, à la fois rois et prêtres. 

La séparation subséquente de l'Eglise et de l'Etat a été l'une des plus abondantes sources de haines et de guerres qui aient ensanglanté l'humanité, chacune de ces deux puissances luttant pour la suprématie, ce qui ne devrait pourtant pas être le cas, car quiconque n'est pas aussi spirituel qu'un prêtre se doit de l'être, n'est pas qualifié pour remplir l'office de roi, et celui qui n'est pas aussi sage et aussi juste qu'un roi se doit de l'être, n'est pas qualifié pour guider spirituellement l'humanité comme le font les prêtres. Lorsque ces qualités se rencontreront à nouveau chez un seul chef, le règne de la paix et de la fraternité universelles deviendra une réalité. Le Christ a été annoncé comme un tel chef, capable d'unir l'Eglise et l'Etat en qualité de roi et de prêtre selon l'Ordre de Melchisedech. Son Second Avènement inaugurera le Millenium, âge de paix et de joie où la symbolique Nouvelle Jérusalem, cité de paix (car Jer-u-Salem veut dire "Ici sera la paix") régnera sur les nations de la terre, unies dans une fraternité universelle. Il y aura alors "paix sur la terre et bonne volonté parmi les hommes."

### <h3 id="question-104">Question 104</h3>

Que veut dire le Christ par ces paroles, "Tous ceux qui sont venus avant Moi étaient des voleurs et des brigands"?

RÉPONSE - L'Apocalypse nous parle de deux grandes cités étrangement semblables, et cependant diamétralement opposées. L'une est Babylone, lieu de confusion où les hommes cessent d'être frères et où ils sont séparés les uns des autres. Elle est située sur sept collines, et est gouvernée par un roi, Lucifer, "étoile du jour", le donneur de lumière. On pleure sa chute au quatorzième chapitre d'Esaïe, et plus loin, on parle encore de la chute de cette grande cité, devenue une abomination, elle est appelée une prostituée, ayant semé la guerre, le malheur et la désolation parmi les peuples de la terre. 

Puis, comme suprême antithèse, on nous parle d'une autre cité, la Nouvelle Jérusalem, honorée comme une fiancée. Dans cette cité, il n'y a point de rivière courante, mais une mer de verre. Elle aussi est bâtie sur sept collines, est gouvernée par un autre donneur de lumière, appelé "la lumière du monde", et c'est une cité de paix dont les portes ne sont jamais fermées, bien qu'elle renferme le précieux Arbre de Vie. Cette cité n'est pas de ce monde, mais c'est une cité descendue du ciel. 

Pour comprendre ce symbole, il est nécessaire de remonter à l'époque lointaine où l'homme en devenir n'avait pas encore atteint le développement d'aujourd'hui. Lors de la première apparition de l'homme sur cette Terre, son corps dense fut construit à l'Epoque Polaire, et fut vitalisé par l'interpénétration du corps vital durant l'Epoque Hyperboréenne. A ce moment, l'homme était comme les Anges, mâle et femelle, une unité créatrice complète, capable de créer de lui-même en projetant toute sa force créatrice - qui est Amour.

Plus tard, il devint nécessaire que l'homme forme un cerveau; afin d'atteindre ce but, la moitié de sa force créatrice a été tournée vers l'intérieur pour construire les organes nécessaires. Depuis ce temps, l'homme doit chercher la coopération d'un être ayant l'autre moitié de la force sexuelle disponible pour la procréation. Maintenant, il aime d'une façon égoïste dans le seul but d'obtenir cette coopération; l'autre moitié de sa force créatrice, avec laquelle il s'est construit un cerveau et un larynx, est utilisée tout aussi égoïstement pour penser, car il désire acquérir des connaissances. 

Antérieurement, l'homme avait projeté toute sa force créatrice sans réserve et en tout désintéressement. Depuis la division de la force sexuelle, l'homme est finalement devenu égoïste, et c'est pourquoi la loi d'attraction en a fait la proie d'êtres de même nature. 

Les Anges étaient l'humanité de la Période de la Lune et ils ont depuis lors atteint leur présent degré de développement supérieur; mais, dans la masse, il y a toujours des retardataires. Tel a été le cas chez les Anges, parmi lesquels une certaine classe, en-dessous d'eux mais au-dessus de notre humanité, est restée en arrière. Ces êtres se trouvaient dans une triste situation, car ils étaient incapables de suivre le développement actuel des Anges, et ils ne pouvaient pas non plus descendre aussi bas dans la matière que les hommes. Il leur était impossible de se dispenser d'un cerveau, comme les Anges, mais ils étaient incapables d'en construire un; aussi, lorsque l'humanité développa un cerveau et une moelle épinière, ils virent en la femme une occasion d'évolution, car elle exprime le pôle négatif de la force créatrice, l'imagination, faculté qui la rend capable de construire un corps physique dans son sein. Afin de gagner l'accès de sa conscience, ces Intelligences tirèrent parti de la perplexité de la femme au sujet de l'exercice de sa faculté d'imagination. 

A cette époque, les yeux des hommes n'étaient pas encore ouverts; êtres essentiellement spirituels, ils n'étaient pas encore pleinement conscients de la possession d'un corps physique. La femme fut la première à observer confusément qu'elle- même, et les autres, possédait un tel instrument, qu'à certains moments quelques-uns de ses amis qu'elle avait perçus auparavant avec ce véhicule l'avaient perdu, et elle en était troublée. Elle ne pouvait obtenir aucune information de la part des Anges, mais l'intelligence qui lui apparut en elle- même dans la moelle épinière serpentine, l'éclaira sur ce sujet, "et le serpent dit à la femme: Dieu vous a-t-il dit, "Vous ne mangerez d'aucun Arbre du Jardin?", à quoi elle répondit, "On nous a défendu de manger de l'Arbre de la Connaissance du Bien et du Mal sous peine de mort." Mais le serpent répartit, "Vous ne mourrez certainement point, car Dieu sait que le jour où vous en mangerez, vos yeux seront ouverts, et vous serez comme les dieux, connaissant le bien et le mal." La femme s'assura la coopération de l'homme, suivant les instructions de Lucifer, donneur de lumière, et dès lors leurs yeux furent ouverts, et ils connurent le bien et le mal. Jusque-là, l'homme n'avait pas eu conscience de son corps; celui-ci l'avait quitté de temps à autre, comme la feuille tombe de l'arbre, sans l'incommoder ou le troubler, car sa conscience était alors centrée sur le Monde Spirituel. Mais les esprits Lucifer désiraient exercer leur pouvoir sur lui et avoir prise sur son cerveau et sa moelle épinière. Ils l'incitèrent donc à rompre le joug des Anges et à prendre en mains la fonction créatrice. Par l'abus répété et ignorant de cette faculté, sa conscience se retira des Mondes Spirituels et se concentra dans le Monde Physique. Alors vint la mort sous ses terribles aspects actuels, car l'homme considère maintenant la vie terrestre comme la seule vie réelle. Lorsqu'elle se termine, il entre dans une existence dont il ne sait rien, et qu'en conséquence il redoute. 

Ainsi, pour avoir écouté Lucifer, le donneur de fausse lumière, l'homme est devenu sujet à l'affliction, à la douleur et à la mort. On lui a volé son innocence et sa paix. Le Christ est venu dans le monde pour sauver l'humanité du péché, de l'affliction et de la mort. C'est pourquoi Il s'est appelé la vraie lumière, et Il a déclaré que ceux qui étaient venus avant Lui étaient des voleurs et des brigands, car ils avaient dérobé à l'homme sa vue spirituelle, tout en l'éclairant au point de vue physique.

### <h3 id="question-105">Question 105</h3>

Que voulait dire le Christ par ces paroles, "Quiconque ne recevra pas le Royaume de Dieu comme un petit enfant n'y entrera point." (Marc 10:15)?

RÉPONSE - Dans le monde qui nous entoure, nous voyons le royaume des hommes, où chacun s'efforce de maintenir sa propre situation, ne comptant que sur ses idées et ses paroles pour la conserver à l'encontre des nouveaux venus. Lorsqu'on lui présente une idée nouvelle, son attitude mentale est généralement teintée de scepticisme. Il craint d'être abusé. 

L'attitude du petit enfant, concernant ce qu'il voit ou ce qu'il entend, est exactement le contraire de celle de ses aînés. Il n'a pas d'opinion exagérée sur ses hautes connaissances, mais il est franchement ignorant et, par conséquent, éminemment réceptif. C'est à cela que se référait le Sauveur dans le passage cité. 

Quand nous entrons dans la vie supérieure, nous devons d'abord oublier tout ce que nous savons du monde, commencer à regarder les choses d'une manière tout à fait différente, et lorsqu'un nouvel enseignement nous est offert, nous devons nous efforcer de le recevoir sans tenir compte d'autres faits observés antérieurement. Ceci, afin de rester parfaitement impartiaux. Bien sûr, on ne nous demande pas de croire d'emblée que "le noir est blanc", mais si quelqu'un affirme qu'un objet que nous avions considéré jusqu'à présent comme noir, est vraiment blanc, notre intellect devrait être assez ouvert pour ne pas nous inciter à porter aussitôt le jugement suivant, "je suis sûr que cet objet est noir!". Nous devrions être disposés à examiner la chose, afin de voir s'il n'existe pas un point de vue d'où l'objet que nous pensons être noir, pourrait apparaître blanc. Lorsqu'après un sérieux examen, nous constatons qu'il est véritablement noir, de quelque point de vue qu'on l'examine, il nous est loisible alors de revenir à notre première opinion. 

Rien n'est plus remarquable chez l'enfant que cette souplesse de l'intellect qui le rend tellement réceptif, et l'étudiant qui s'efforce de vivre la vie supérieure devrait toujours aspirer à garder à son intellect cette souplesse, car dès que nos idées deviennent fixes et incapables d'être changées, nos progrès cessent. C'est là la grande vérité que le Christ S'est efforcé de présenter à Ses auditeurs lorsqu'Il a fait la déclaration ayant fait l'objet de la question posée.

### <h3 id="question-106">Question 106</h3>

Jésus n'a-t-Il pas mangé du poisson? Pourquoi les Rosicruciens sont-ils donc végétariens?

RÉPONSE - Après la Résurrection, le Christ est apparu un jour à Ses disciples tandis qu'ils étaient dans une chambre fermée à clé. Ils ne Le reconnurent pas tout d'abord, et ne pensaient pas que Son corps fût matériel. Le véhicule dans lequel Il leur apparut était le corps vital de Jésus, et Il lui était possible, comme à toute personne capable de fonctionner dans ce véhicule, d'attirer de la Région Chimique une quantité suffisante de matière pour se construire en un instant un corps dense parfaitement tangible. Afin de les convaincre qu'Il était comme à l'ordinaire, Il leur demanda quelque chose à manger, et ils lui donnèrent un morceau de rayon de miel et du poisson. Il est dit qu'Il mangea (Luc 24:43), mais non qu'Il mangea du poisson, car ayant été élevé parmi les Esséniens qui étaient strictement végétariens, Il n'aurait pas plus mangé de poisson qu'Il n'aurait mangé de viande si on la Lui avait présentée. 

Il est aussi écrit que le Bouddha mourut après s'être gorgé de viande de sanglier, ce qui est vraiment divertissant pour quiconque sait qu'il enseignait à ses disciples la vie simple et inoffensive qu'il menait lui-même, qu'il leur conseillait de se nourrir des aliments les plus purs et les meilleurs provenant directement du sol, et qu'il était ému de la plus grande pitié à la vue des souffrances des hommes et des animaux. L'étudiant en ésotérisme sait que, dans les temps anciens, le sanglier était le symbole des connaissances ésotériques. Or nous pouvons donner aux autres toutes nos connaissances; plus nous en donnons, plus nous en avons, et la même somme de savoir subsiste. Cette vérité était enseignée dans la mythologie scandinave; dans le Valhalla, les guerriers ayant combattu le bon combat s'asseyaient à un festin autour d'un sanglier fait de telle sorte qu'un morceau de chair coupée repoussait aussitôt, si bien qu'il y avait toujours abondance de viande, quelle que fût la quantité enlevée, et quel que fût le nombre des convives. Or, Bouddha s'était gorgé des connaissances sacrées et, à sa mort, il en était rempli. 

Néanmoins l'auteur de la question part d'une idée fausse. Les Rosicruciens n'enseignent pas que tout le monde devrait être végétarien sur- le-champ. En fait ils disent qu'une alimentation végétarienne fournit beaucoup plus d'énergie qu'une alimentation carnée. Cette énergie n'est pas seulement physique mais spirituelle, en sorte que si un homme mène une vie sédentaire, qu'il ait des tendances matérialistes et soit uniquement préoccupé de sordides opérations commerciales ou d'autres affaires strictement matérielles, cette énergie spirituelle ne peut trouver aucune issue, et elle est susceptible d'occasionner des troubles dans son organisme. Seuls, ceux qui vivent une vie active, au grand air, où l'abondance d'énergie générée par la nourriture végétarienne peut être dépensée, ou ceux qui transmuent cette énergie en efforts spirituels peuvent se trouver bien de cette alimentation. Nous reconnaissons en outre que les habitudes suivies pendant de nombreuses générations ont fait de l'homme un être en partie carnivore, de sorte que, dans un grand nombre de cas, le changement d'une alimentation carnée à une alimentation végétarienne doit se faire graduellement. D'autre part, il faut se rappeler que l'alimentation qui convient à l'un ne convient pas nécessairement à l'autre, et le vieux proverbe est vrai qui dit que "ce qui est nourriture pour l'un est poison pour un autre". On ne peut donc établir aucune règle rigoureuse qui convienne également à tous. C'est pourquoi il est préférable que ce que nous mangeons, aussi bien que tout ce qui se rapporte à notre personnalité, fasse l'objet d'un choix individuel. 

La Bible enseigne fort justement que ce n'est pas ce qui entre par la bouche qui nous souille. Si nous mangeons une nourriture répugnante et que nous en soyons avides, c'est l'avidité qui constitue notre péché et non la nourriture elle-même. Si quelqu'un se trouve en un lieu où il ne puisse obtenir la nourriture pure qui lui plaît, il fera bien d'accepter la nourriture qui lui est offerte, même de la viande, et cela sans dégoût, et avec autant de reconnaissance que s'il s'agissait d'aliments purs. Il ne sera nullement corrompu, grâce à cette attitude d'esprit.

### <h3 id="question-107">Question 107</h3>

Si le Christ a nourri la multitude de poisson, pourquoi est-il faux que nous en fassions usage comme nourriture, ainsi que de la viande?

RÉPONSE - Il est dans la nature des animaux de proie de dévorer tout animal qu'il trouve sur son chemin, et son organisme exige cette sorte de nourriture pour subsister; mais toute chose est dans un état de devenir, et est en train de changer en quelque chose de supérieur. L'homme, aux premiers degrés de son développement, était semblable à certains égards aux animaux de proie; cependant il doit devenir semblable à Dieu, et il lui faudra cesser de détruire, à un moment donné, afin de pouvoir commencer à créer. Les Juifs, au temps du Christ, se trouvaient encore à un degré où leur nature animale était tellement impérieuse qu'ils n'avaient qu'une très petite idée de l'altruisme. Ils adhéraient à la loi "oeil pour oeil, dent pour dent", et n'étaient miséricordieux sous aucuns rapports.Nous sommes allés un peu plus loin sur le chemin de l'évolution, depuis deux mille ans, et l'altruisme passe de plus en plus au premier rang. 

On nous enseigne qu'il n'y a dans l'univers qu'une vie, celle de Dieu. "Qu'en Lui nous avons la vie, le mouvement et l'être". Que Sa vie anime tout ce qui est, et c'est pourquoi nous comprenons que si nous prenons la vie, nous détruisons la forme construite par Dieu pour Sa manifestation. Les animaux, nos jeunes frères sur l'échelle de l'évolution, sont des esprits qui évoluent, et ils sont doués de sensibilité. Le désir qu'ils ont d'acquérir de l'expérience leur fait construire des formes variées et lorsque nous les privons de ces formes, nous leur ôtons l'occasion d'acquérir de l'expérience. Nous entravons leur évolution au lieu de les aider. Le cannibale est excusable de manger ses semblables, parce qu'il ne sait rien d'autre. Nous considérons maintenant le cannibalisme avec horreur, et le jour viendra aussi où nous ressentirons le même dégoût à l'idée de faire de notre estomac la sépulture des cadavres d'animaux massacrés. 

Il est naturel pour nous de désirer la meilleure nourriture possible, mais la chair des animaux renferme les poisons de la putréfaction. Le sang veineux, dans son cours vers les reins, vers les pores de la peau, est chargé d'acide carbonique et autres composés nocifs qui doivent être expulsés sous forme d'urine ou de sueur. Ces substances toxiques se trouvent dans toutes les parties de la chair de l'animal; en la mangeant, nous remplissons notre corps de toxines. Un grand nombre de maladies sont dues à la consommation d'aliments carnés. 

Lorsque nous en appelons à l'autorité de la Bible pour nous excuser de manger de la viande, nous devrions aussi être disposés à suivre ses injonctions et cesser de manger de la viande de porc qui est bien la plus horrible des nourritures. C'est un fait notoire que les Juifs pratiquants qui s'abstiennent des aliments interdits par la Bible échappent à la tuberculose et au cancer.

Dans maints endroits où la Bible parle de "meat", mot anglais à double sens, il est clair qu'il ne s'agit pas de la chair des animaux. Au premier chapitre de la Genèse, où la nourriture de l'homme est décrite pour la première fois, il est dit qu'il devra se nourrir "de tout arbre, de toute herbe portant fruits et semences et que ce sera là sa nourriture (meat)." Les personnes les plus évoluées de tous les temps se sont toujours abstenues de manger la chair des animaux. A titre d'exemple, nous voyons que le saint et sage Daniel avait prié qu'on ne l'oblige pas, lui et ses compagnons, à manger de la viande, mais qu'on leur donne des légumineuses. On dit des enfants d'Israël dans le désert qu'ils "regrettaient les pots de viande" de l'Egypte, ce qui avait suscité le courroux de leur Dieu. 

Le récit de la multitude nourrie de poissons a une signification ésotérique, mais nous bornant à considérer l'aspect purement matériel des choses, nous résumerons les différents points examinés dans notre réponse en rappelant que le temps viendra où, ayant progressé sur le chemin de l'évolution, nous perdrons l'habitude de consommer de la viande et du poisson, comme nous nous sommes élevés au-dessus du cannibalisme. Tout ce qui peut avoir été licite dans les temps barbares disparaîtra dans un avenir où l'altruisme, fruit d'une sensibilité plus affinée, aura éveillé en nous la pleine signification des horreurs qu'entraîne la satisfaction des goûts carnivores.

For a very full presentation of the question, "Does the Bible justify Flesh Eating," we would refer the inquirer to a little pamphlet by that name issued by the Unity Society of Kansas City, Missouri, which gives the pro and the con with great impartiality, and shows that it was only as a concession to the before mentioned lust for flesh that the practice was tolerated at all. 

### <h3 id="question-108">Question 108</h3>

Expliquez, je vous prie, pourquoi le veau gras n'a pas été tué pour le fils vertueux plutôt que pour le fils prodigue (Luc 15:11-32). N'était-ce pas récompenser une mauvaise action?

RÉPONSE - L'histoire du fils prodigue est une parabole par laquelle le Christ avait l'intention d'enseigner une leçon et pas un fait réel. C'est l'histoire qui raconte le pèlerinage de l'esprit à travers la matière. Or, il y a différentes classes d'esprits. Certains, mais pas tous, sont allés à l'école de l'expérience qu'est le monde. Ils sont descendus depuis leur condition élevée du Monde de Dieu, et ont pénétré de plus en plus profondément dans l'océan de la matière jusqu'à s'y trouver aveuglés. Finalement, ils sont immergés dans la matière dense du Monde Physique. Là est le tournant où ils s'éveillent; là, le sentier inconscient de l'involution est à son terme; là, la soi-conscience est atteinte, en même temps que la conscience du monde extérieur. Mais l'esprit intérieur (au-dedans de nous) n'est pas satisfait de rester dans ce monde. A nouveau éveillé au sens de sa divinité inhérente, il se sent de nouveau attiré vers les sphères supérieures et dit: "Je me lèverai et j'irai vers mon Père."

Vient alors le rude labeur de se dépouiller des divers véhicules dans lesquels il s'est immergé et de s'élever une fois encore à la communion consciente avec Dieu. Alors qu'il est engagé dans cette tâche ardue, "le Père vient à sa rencontre un long bout de chemin"; la petite voix intérieure, toujours présente, commence à se faire entendre au-dedans de lui, à lui parler de la gloire des cieux; enfin, lorsque l'humanité a terminé son évolution, ou que l'esprit individuel a pris le plus court sentier de l'initiation, il y a réunion avec Dieu et les autres esprits qui ne sont pas encore entrés à l'école de l'expérience. Naturellement, il y a plus de réjouissance pour le retour de celui qui a soutenu le bon combat et qui est revenu dans sa céleste demeure, que pour celui qui n'a pas encore cherché à tirer parti de l'occasion qui lui est présentée.

### <h3 id="question-109">Question 109</h3>

Pourquoi le Seigneur a-t-il loué l'économe infidèle, comme on le raconte au 16e chapitre de Luc?

RÉPONSE - L'auteur de la question devrait relire attentivement le 16e chapitre de Luc. On y parle d'un économe infidèle amené devant son seigneur qui soupçonnait que ses comptes n'étaient pas exacts. L'économe fit un marché avec les débiteurs de son maître afin de s'en faire des amis pour le moment où il aurait perdu son emploi. Il est dit au verset 8 que "le seigneur loua l'économe infidèle". Lorsqu'il rendit ses comptes, il avait dû les arranger si adroitement que son maître y fut trompé, car le "seigneur" dont il est question était le maître de l'économe, comme on peut s'en rendre compte par le fait que le mot "seigneur" est écrit avec une minuscule, tandis qu'une majuscule est toujours employée lorsque le mot se rapporte au Christ.

### <h3 id="question-110">Question 110</h3>

Voulez-vous bien expliquer ce que veut dire: pécher contre le Saint-Esprit?

RÉPONSE - Généralement parlant, le Saint-Esprit est le pouvoir créateur de Dieu. Le passage du credo, "conçu du Saint-Esprit", ce que l'Ange Gabriel avait annoncé à Marie, en est une confirmation. Tout ce qui est, a été amené à l'existence par ce pouvoir créateur, et c'est un rayon de cet attribut de Dieu dont se servent les hommes pour la perpétuation de la race humaine. Lorsque nous en abusons, c'est-à-dire que nous en usons pour la satisfaction des sens, soit solitairement, soit en association, dans le mariage ou en dehors du mariage, nous péchons contre le Saint-Esprit. Ce péché, nous dit-on, n'est pas pardonné, il doit être expié. L'humanité tout entière souffre aujourd'hui de ce péché. Les corps débiles, les maladies que nous voyons autour de nous sont dus à des siècles d'excès et, tant que nous n'aurons pas appris à maîtriser nos passions, il ne pourra pas y avoir de vraie santé dans la race humaine. Nous sommes nés de parents qui pensaient qu'il était juste de satisfaire leurs passions en tout temps et à n'importe quel moment. En conséquence, nous en souffrons maintenant, et par notre attitude à l'égard de la question "sexe", la plupart d'entre nous sommes en train de reporter actuellement les mêmes maladies sur nos enfants. C'est ainsi que les péchés des parents retombent sur les enfants, de génération en génération, et continueront à apporter affliction et souffrances jusqu'à ce que nous ayons compris que chaque enfant a le droit d'être "bien né" et de bénéficier des conditions physiques appropriées pendant sa vie prénatale.

### <h3 id="question-111">Question 111</h3>

Le credo Chrétien est-il de source divine?

RÉPONSE - Il y a trois formes de credo Chrétien. L'un est connu sous le nom de Credo des Apôtres, non pas qu'il ait été composé par les Apôtres, mais parce qu'il est supposé exprimer leurs croyances. Un autre credo fut formulé et adopté au Concile de Nicée, et est appelé Credo de Nicée. Le credo d'Athanase, est le plus récent. Ils ne sont pas plus de source divine que n'importe quelle autre affirmation des hommes concernant la Bible. 

La Bible elle-même donne un credo, dans le passage qui affirme qu'il n'y a pas d'autre nom que celui de Jésus-Christ par lequel l'homme doive être sauvé (Actes 4:12), et ceci est en harmonie avec l'enseignement occulte, car Jéhovah fut l'auteur de toutes les Religions de Race où la crainte de Dieu faisait obstacle aux désirs de la chair et où la loi était imposée à l'homme pour réfréner le désir. Les Religions de Race éduquent la nature-désir par les moyens précités, mais elles seront remplacées le moment venu par la Religion du Christ. Cette religion de fraternité et d'amour bannira la crainte engendrée par la loi de Jéhovah. Elle essaiera d'abolir les nations, leurs lois, leurs luttes et rivalités, en travaillant sur le corps vital, en sorte que l'humanité soit animée entièrement par l'amour, au lieu de l'être par la loi. Mais là n'est pas le point final, cependant. Lorsque le royaume aura été complètement établi, le Christ le remettra entre les mains du Père. La Religion du Père sera plus élevée encore que la Religion du Fils.

### <h3 id="question-112">Question 112</h3>

Comment conciliez-vous la loi de cause à effet avec la doctrine du pardon des péchés?

RÉPONSE - Parce qu'ils ne peuvent croire au pardon des péchés, beaucoup croient exclusivement à la loi de cause à effet, telle qu'elle est enseignée en Orient sous le nom de Karma. De nombreuses personnes pensent aussi que puisque les religions orientales enseignent les lois de renaissance et de cause à effet plus clairement que la religion de l'Occident, le Christianisme, ces religions orientales sont meilleures et plus scientifiques que la religion occidentale qui enseigne, d'après l'interprétation populaire, que le Christ est mort pour nos péchés et qu'en conséquence, le fait de croire en Lui nous apporte le pardon.

En fait, cependant, l'enseignement Chrétien énonce aussi la doctrine qui veut que "ce qu'un homme a semé, il le récoltera", (Galates 6:7), et c'est ainsi qu'il enseigne à la fois la loi de cause à effet et celle du pardon des péchés. Ces deux lois opèrent de façon vitale dans l'épanouissement de l'humanité, et il y a de bonnes raisons au fait que les religions orientales primitives ne contiennent qu'une partie de l'enseignement complet que l'on trouve dans la religion Chrétienne.

Dans les temps reculés où les religions de l'Orient furent données à l'humanité, les hommes étaient de nature plus spirituelle que ne le sont de nos jours les êtres essentiellement matériels du Monde Occidental. Ils savaient que nous vivons ici-bas un grand nombre de vie en des corps différents. De nos jours, les Orientaux, encore complètement imbus de cette idée, sont en conséquence extrêmement indolents. Ils sont plus préoccupés du Nirvana - monde invisible où ils se reposeront dans la paix et la joie - qu'à chercher à tirer parti de leurs ressources matérielles présentes, en vue de leur avancement. C'est la raison pour laquelle leur pays est aride, inculte, leurs récoltes minimes et souvent détruites par un soleil brûlant, ou dévastées par des inondations. Ils souffrent de la famine, ils meurent par milliers; et bien qu'ils enseignent la loi de cause à effet, ils semblent ne pas se rendre compte que leurs misérable conditions sont amenées par leur indolence et leur indifférence vis-à-vis des choses matérielles. Il est naturel que, n'ayant pas travaillé ici-bas, ils n'aient rien à assimiler au cours de la vie céleste entre la mort et une nouvelle naissance; et tel un organe s'atrophie graduellement faute d'être utilisé, ainsi un pays qui n'est pas développé par les esprits qui y sont incarnés, dépérit graduellement et devient impropre à être habité par les humains. Il était nécessaire à l'évolution de l'humanité que celle-ci passe par ce monde matériel pour en développer toutes les ressources. 

C'est pourquoi les Grands Guides de l'humanité ont employé divers moyens pour nous faire oublier temporairement le côté spirituel de notre nature. En Occident, où se trouvent les pionniers de la race humaine, ils ont ordonné que les mariages se fassent en dehors de la famille. Ils ont donné à l'Occident une religion qui n'enseignait pas d'une manière précise la doctrine de la renaissance et la loi de cause à effet comme moyens de progrès. Ils ont établi l'usage des boissons alcoolisées qui ont pour effet de paralyser la sensibilité spirituelle de l'homme. Par suite, nous avons en Occident temporairement oublié qu'il existe autre chose que cette seule vie sur terre, et, en conséquence, nous nous appliquons avec la plus grande diligence à faire le meilleur usage possible de ce que nous croyons être notre seule occasion ici-bas. Ainsi, nous avons développé l'Occident en de véritables jardins; nous en avons fait, dans l'entre-deux vies, une terre extrêmement fertile et riche, par ailleurs, en minéraux de toutes sortes, qui nous fournissent tout ce dont nous avons besoin pour nos diverses industries; nous faisons ainsi la conquête du monde matériel visible.

Il est évident, cependant, que le côté religieux de la nature humaine ne doit pas être entièrement négligé, et c'est pourquoi le Christ, idéal sublime de la religion Chrétienne, nous a été donné comme exemple à imiter. Et du moment que nous ne pouvons pas espérer devenir semblables au Christ au cours d'une seule vie, qui est tout ce que nous connaissons pour le présent, il doit nous être donné une doctrine compensatrice; autrement, en désespoir de cause, nous cesserions tous nos efforts, connaissant leur futilité. C'est la raison pour laquelle on a enseigné au Monde Occidental la doctrine du pardon des péchés par la vertu de Jésus-Christ. 

Il est également certain, toutefois, qu'une doctrine qui n'est pas une vérité de la nature ne peut exercer une puissance élévatrice, et c'est pourquoi il doit aussi y avoir une base solide derrière la doctrine du pardon des péchés qui semble invalider la loi de cause à effet; la voici: 

Lorsque nous regardons autour de nous dans le monde matériel, nous observons les différents phénomènes de la nature, nous rencontrons d'autres personnes avec lesquelles nous engageons diverses transactions, et c'est au moyen de nos organes des sens que nous observons l'ensemble de ces spectacles, de ces sons et de ces scènes. Pas tous, cependant, car nous sommes très peu observateurs en ce qui concerne les détails. Et il est vrai de dire, même si c'est exaspérant, que "nous avons des yeux qui ne voient pas et des oreilles qui n'entendent pas". De ce fait, nous perdons une grande partie de l'expérience qui pourrait être acquise. De plus, la mémoire nous fait déplorablement défaut; puisque nous ne sommes capables de nous souvenir que d'une petite partie de nos expériences et la plupart d'entre elles sont perdues parce que nous les oublions. S'il est vrai que notre mémoire consciente est faible, nous en possédons une autre, plus fidèle: la mémoire subconsciente. De même que l'éther et l'air transmettent sur le film photographique l'impression du paysage compris dans le champ de l'appareil, sans que le moindre détail soit omis, ainsi l'air et l'éther qui transmettent les impressions du dehors à nos organes des sens portent aux poumons, et de là, au sang, l'image et l'enregistrement de tout ce avec quoi nous entrons en contact. Ces images sont emmagasinées dans le petit atome-germe placé dans le ventricule gauche du coeur, et ce petit atome peut être considéré comme le Livre des Anges de Justice où sont inscrites toutes nos actions. De là, elles sont imprimées dans l'éther réflecteur de notre corps vital. 

Dans le cours ordinaire de la vie, l'homme entre au Purgatoire à la mort pour y expier les péchés gravés sur cet atome. Plus tard, il assimile au Premier Ciel le bien également enregistré sur ce même atome. Au Deuxième Ciel, l'homme travaille à son milieu futur. Mais une personne pieuse se rend compte chaque jour de ses fautes et de ses faiblesses. Elle examine scrupuleusement les évènements de sa vie journalière et prie avec ferveur pour le pardon des péchés qu'elle a commis. Alors les images enregistrées des péchés d'omission et de commission s'effacent et sont enlevés jour après jour des annales de sa vie. En effet, le but de Dieu et de la nature n'est pas de nous "rendre la pareille", comme cela semble être le cas sous la loi de cause à effet qui exige l'exacte rétribution pour chaque transgression, aussi bien que la juste récompense ou compensation pour chaque bonne action. Le dessein de Dieu est de nous faire apprendre par l'expérience ce qui est juste et bon. Lorsque, nous nous sommes rendu compte que nous avions mal agi et que nous avons pris la résolution de faire mieux, notre leçon est apprise, et il n'est pas nécessaire que nous soyons punis. 

Ainsi, la doctrine du pardon des péchés est un fait réel dans la Nature. Si nous nous repentons, si nous prions et nous corrigeons, les péchés dont nous nous sommes repentis, pour lesquels nous avons prié et fait les réformes nécessaires, nous sont pardonnés et sont effacés des annales de notre vie. Si ce n'est pas le cas, ils sont extirpés après la mort, par les souffrances appropriées au Purgatoire. Ainsi, la doctrine du Karma ou loi de cause à effet, telle qu'elle est enseignée en Orient, ne satisfait pas entièrement les besoins humains, tandis que l'enseignement Chrétien, qui comprend à la fois la loi de cause à effet et la doctrine du pardon des péchés, donne un enseignement plus complet de la méthode employée par les Grands Chefs de l'humanité pour nous instruire.

### <h3 id="question-113">Question 113</h3>

Par quel pouvoir Pierre a-t-il ressuscité Dorcas (Actes 9:36- 41)?

RÉPONSE - Pierre n'a pas plus ressuscité Dorcas que le Christ n'a ressuscité Lazare ou aucun autre, ce que, d'ailleurs, Il n'a pas prétendu. Il a dit, "Lazare n'est pas mort, il dort."

Pour que cette assertion puisse être comprise, nous devons expliquer ce qui a lieu à la mort, et en quoi elle diffère de la transe, car les personnes mentionnées plus haut étaient dans cet état au moment où les prétendus miracles se sont accomplis.

Pendant l'état de veille, lorsque l'Ego fonctionne consciemment dans le Monde Physique, ses divers véhicules sont concentriques - ils occupent le même espace - mais la nuit, lorsque le corps dort, une séparation a lieu. L'Ego, revêtu de l'intellect et du corps du désir, se dégage du corps dense et du corps vital qui sont laissés sur le lit. Les véhicules supérieurs planent à côté ou au-dessus. Ils sont reliés aux deux véhicules plus denses par la corde d'argent, fil mince et brillant affectant la forme de deux six inversés, dont l'une des extrémités est rattachée à l'atome-germe du coeur, et l'autre au centre du tourbillon du corps du désir.

Au moment de la mort, ce fil se rompt à l'endroit de l'atome-germe du coeur, et les forces de cet atome passent le long du nerf pneumogastrique, à travers le troisième ventricule du cerveau et sortent par la suture entre l'os occipital et l'os pariétal du crâne, suivent la corde d'argent et gagnent les véhicules supérieurs. Simultanément à la rupture de l'atome-germe, le corps vital se dégage aussi pour rejoindre les véhicules supérieurs planant au- dessus du cadavre. Il reste là environ trois jours et demi. Puis, les véhicules supérieurs se dégagent du corps vital qui se désintègre habituellement en même temps que le corps dense.

Au moment de cette dernière séparation, la corde d'argent se brise par le milieu, et l'Ego est libéré du contact avec le monde matériel.

Pendant le sommeil, l'Ego se retire aussi du corps dense, mais le corps vital y demeure et la corde d'argent reste intacte.

Il peut arriver qu'au matin l'Ego ne réintègre pas son corps pour l'éveiller comme à l'ordinaire, et qu'il reste en dehors pendant une période qui varie d'un jour à un temps indéfini. Nous disons alors que le corps est en transe naturelle. Mais la corde d'argent n'est rompue à aucun des deux endroits mentionnés. Lorsque la rupture a eu lieu, aucune restauration n'est possible. Etant clairvoyants, le Christ et les apôtres voyaient qu'aucune rupture n'avait eu lieu dans les cas mentionnés. De là ces paroles, "Il n'est pas mort, mais il dort." Ils possédaient le pouvoir de forcer l'Ego à rentrer dans son corps et à y ramener les conditions normales. C'est ainsi qu'ils ont accompli ces prétendus miracles.

### <h3 id="question-114">Question 114</h3>

Croyez-vous à la conversion?

RÉPONSE - Certainement, mais il y a conversion et conversion. Il y a la conversion qui a lieu au cours d'une réunion de réveil religieux, au son du tambour, de battements de mains, de chants religieux, et avec l'appel insistant du prédicateur, "venez avant qu'il ne soit trop tard." Toutes ces méthodes de conversion ont une forte influence hypnotique qui s'exerce sur la nature émotionnelle de bien des gens, de sorte que ces "pécheurs" ne peuvent plus rester sur leur siège, mais sont forcés, au sens le plus littéral du terme, d'obéir au commandement et de s'avancer vers le "banc des pénitents". Cette sorte de conversion est généralement de peu de valeur. Les prédicateurs du "Réveil" reconnaissent qu'il est extrêmement facile de convertir les gens de cette manière, mais la grande difficulté est de faire persister cette conversion, car lorsque la victime de l'influence hypnotique quitte la réunion, celle-ci se dissipe progressivement et, tôt ou tard, la personne retrouve son attitude habituelle. Ce qui n'empêche pas qu'à la prochaine "réunion", les auteurs de ces rechutes, nullement affligés de celles-ci, sont de nouveau attirés au banc des pénitents, tout comme une aiguille est attirée par un aimant. Ils se convertissent périodiquement et rechutent régulièrement, à la grande déception du prédicateur et pour le plus grand amusement de la communauté qui n'est pas consciente qu'il s'agit de simples cas d'hypnotisme bénin.

Il y a une autre conversion, cependant, qui est toujours accompagnée d'influences planétaires, et selon la force de ces dernières, la conversion, ou le changement de vie, est plus ou moins radical. Elle montre que l'âme a atteint un certain point dans son pèlerinage où elle se sent attirée vers la vie supérieure. La cause immédiate de la conversion peut être un sermon, une conférence, un livre, un verset de la Bible, ou quelque chose dans la nature, mais ce n'est que la cause physique de quelque chose qui était déjà un fait spirituellement. Dès ce moment, la personne commence à envisager la vie d'une manière différente, elle rompt avec ses anciens vices, suit une nouvelle ligne de pensées et d'efforts. Cette conversion peut changer entièrement son attitude à l'égard de la vie et de son milieu également. En fait, il arrive souvent qu'un voyage l'éloigne pendant quelque temps de son entourage, pour lui donner l'occasion de semer la nouvelle semence.

### <h3 id="question-115">Question 115</h3>

La confession et l'absolution ont-elles une valeur quelconque?

RÉPONSE - Si l'on comprend la confession et l'absolution dans le sens où elles sont pratiquées dans l'Eglise Catholique, on peut dire que le prêtre n'a certainement aucun pouvoir de pardonner les péchés du pénitent, et que la confession ordonnée par l'Eglise n'est tout au plus qu'un étalage de pénitence rappelant la prière faite par le Pharisien qui est entré ostensiblement dans le temple pour être vu.

Si, au contraire, la confession est faite comme celle du Publicain, dans un esprit de vraie pénitence, elle a alors une certaine valeur; car de même qu'un petit enfant ayant commis une faute sent le remord dans sa conscience et se repent, de même nous pouvons nous sentir profondément contrits pour un péché d'omission ou de commission.

C'est un fait souvent constaté par de bons parents qu'un repentir non exprimé est insuffisant pour l'enfant. Il éprouve le besoin d'aller vers son père ou sa mère pour lui confesser son péché. Lorsqu'il a obtenu le pardon du père ou de la mère, sa conscience est en repos. Il en est de même des enfants de Dieu, Nous péchons et nous sommes attristés pour nos péchés; nous prenons la résolution de ne plus les commettre ou de ne plus faire le mal à nouveau; mais si nous pouvons nous confesser à quelqu'un en qui nous avons confiance, gagner sa sympathie et en obtenir l'assurance que notre faute ne sera pas retenue contre nous, nous sentons notre conscience plus légère. C'est là le principe sur lequel repose le commandement de la Bible, "Confessez vos péchés les uns aux autres.", (Psaumes 32:5; Proverbes 20:9; IJean 1:9). La personne à laquelle nous nous confessons doit, bien entendu, nous inspirer le plus profond respect et la plus grande affection. Elle sera, à ce moment, le représentant de Dieu ou de notre nature supérieure, et nous nous sentirons ainsi grandement soulagés en recevant sa sympathie. Mais nous sentirons aissi que le pacte fait avec nous-mêmes de ne plus commettre le péché en question a été fortifié par la présence d'un témoin. Si la confession est faite ainsi, et l'absolution obtenue de cette façon, l'une et l'autre ont sans nul doute un effet très salutaire.

### <h3 id="question-116">Question 116</h3>

Le rituel latin employé dans les églises catholiques a-t-il une valeur quelconque? Ne vaudrait-il pas mieux le traduire pour que les gens puissent le comprendre? Les sermons et les prières spontanées dans les églises protestantes ne sont-ils pas préférables au rituel et aux messes stéréotypées des catholiques?

RÉPONSE - De nos jours, l'humanité toute entière a suffisamment évolué pour être, à certains égards, au-dessus de la loi. A titre d'exemple, la plupart des gens obéissent au commandement, "Tu ne déroberas point".

La loi agit comme un frein sur la nature-désir, mais lorsqu'on a en vue un avancement occulte ou plutôt spirituel, la spiritualisation du corps vital doit aussi être exécutée. Et celle-ci s'obtient au moyen de l'Art et de la Religion, sous l'effet d'impacts souvent répétés, car la note dominante du corps vital est la répétition, comme nous pouvons le voir en regardant les plantes qui n'ont qu'un corps dense et un corps vital: tige et feuille se suivent l'une l'autre en une succession vers le haut; la plante, en grandissant, les produit alternativement. C'est le corps vital qui a construit les vertèbres dorsales l'une après l'autre par constante répétition. Et la mémoire, par exemple, qui est l'une des facultés du corps vital, se fortifie et se développe grâce à des redites continuelles.

Quand les Protestants ont quitté l'Eglise Catholique, ils ont sans doute laissé beaucoup d'abus derrière eux, mais ils ont aussi laissé presque toutes les choses de valeur. Ils ont abandonné le rituel que chacun peut connaître et comprendre en dépit de la prononciation laborieuse du prédicateur. Connaissant le rituel, les fidèles peuvent orienter leurs pensées dans la même direction que celle du prêtre qui le lit, et c'est ainsi qu'un volume énorme de pensées spirituelles identiques sont rassemblées et projetées pour le bien comme pour le mal, sur toute l'assistance. De nos jours, les paroissiens dans une église Protestante écoutent la prière ou le sermon improvisé de leur pasteur qui, habituellement, ne pense pas tant au travail spirituel qui est le sien, qu'à la manière la plus euphonique de tourner ses phrases pour charmer les oreilles de ses ouailles, qui oublient ce qu'il a dit avant d'avoir quitté l'église. Ceux qui vont à l'église Catholique en comprenant le rituel, sont toujours capables de réunir leurs pensées en une assemblée spirituelle et de garder à la mémoire tout ce qui s'est passé. C'est ainsi qu'ils ajoutent chaque fois quelque chose à la spiritualisation de leur corps vital, alors que les fidèles de l'église Protestante n'ont été affectés que dans leur nature émotionnelle, et cet effet est bientôt dissipé. On nous recommande, dans la Bible, de prier sans cesse, et nombreux sont les railleurs qui disent que puisque Dieu est omniscient, Il connaît nos besoins sans qu'on Le prie et que, s'Il ne l'est pas, il est probable qu'Il n'est pas non plus tout- puissant, en sorte que nos prières ne sont pas exaucées, et qu'il est inutile de prier. Mais ce commandement a été faite en fonction de la connaissance de la nature du corps vital, qui a besoin de la répétition pour être spiritualisé.

Voici ce qu'il en est du rituel. A propos de l'emploi de la langue latine, il est écrit au premier chapitre de l'Evangile de Jean, "Au commencement était le Verbe (ou la parole) ... et rien de ce qui a été fait n'a été fait sans lui". La parole est un son. Si nous mettons du sable ou des spores sur un plateau de cuivre ou une plaque de verre et que nous passons sur les bords un archet de violon, nous produisons un son qui a pour effet de disposer les spores ou le sable en des figures géométriques semblables à celles des cristaux qui composent toutes les choses. Chaque son produit une disposition spéciale. Alors, si un certain son produit un certain effet que nous désirons produire, nous ne pouvons changer le son sans changer l'effet. Si nous émettons un certain son pour prononcer "Deum", puis que nous traduisions Deum pour dire Dieu, le son est très différent, et comme le son produit certains effets sur nos corps invisibles, les effets produits par le rituel original latin ont été perdus pour les églises Protestantes qui l'ont traduit ou abandonné entièrement.

Souvent, les gens s'étonnent de constater combien l'Eglise Catholique a d'emprise sur ses membres, et l'on peut dire que si elle abandonnait le rituel latin, elle ne perdrait pas un de ses adhérents en dix ans. D'ailleurs, leurs rituels véritablement occultes n'ont jamais été transposés en aucune langue, et même chez les Rosicruciens, les rituels latins, bien que ce ne soit pas ceux utilisés dans l'Eglise Catholique, sont en usage durant les services.

### <h3 id="question-117">Question 117</h3>

Quel est le mérite du martyre? Les martyrs deviennent-il vraiment des saints?

RÉPONSE - L'homme s'élève jusqu'à l'union avec Dieu grâce à quatre grands échelons. D'abord, il prie un Dieu ou Lui offre des sacrifices parce qu'il Le craint, et c'est pourquoi il cherche à se le rendre favorable, afin que son Dieu ne lui fasse pas de mal. En suite, il apprend à considérer ceDieu comme un puissant allié contre ses ennemis et comme le dispensateur de tous ses biens, à condition de Lui obéir et de Lui sacrifier une partie de ses possessions matérielles. Au troisième échelon, on lui apprend à se sacrifier lui-même en vivant une vie de droiture, et à attendre d'être récompensé dans une condition future appelée le ciel, où il vivra dans un bonheur éternel en compensation de ce qu'il aura pu endurer pendant sa vie terrestre. Les martyrs en étaient au point où ils avaient acquis cette croyance, et ils étaient tout pénétrés de la vérité et de la gloire des cieux. C'était donc une chose simple pour eux que de sacrifier leur vie afin d'atteindre d'un seul coup à la gloire future.

En réalité, si le martyre peut nous ouvrir le ciel en vue d'un bonheur éternel, c'est là une méthode bien facile d'obtenir cette récompense. Il faut certainement du courage pour mourir, mais après tout, il en faut infiniment plus pour vivre. Nous sommes très enclins à croire que lorsqu'un homme a donné sa vie, il a tout donné, et souvent l'on entend dire d'un homme qui s'est suicidé, qu'"il s'est acquitté". En fait, le suicide est généralement la marque de la plus grande lâcheté possible, et le martyr est souvent beaucoup moins à admirer que la vie de certaines personnes qui, jour après jour, s'efforcent de suivre les enseignements de la Bible en menant une noble vie. Nous admettons volontiers que les martyrs doivent être admirés pour leur attachement inébranlable à leur foi en face de la mort et de la torture. Ils auront très certainement de plus grandes occasions de croissance spirituelle dans leurs vies futures que dans celle dont ils ont été privés lorsqu'ils ont été brûlés sur le bûcher ou exterminés d'une autre façon. Et nous pouvons aussi dire qu'ils étaient des saints et de saintes gens en ce sens que leur foi avait à leurs yeux plus de valeur que la vie, mais nous maintenons que les édits d'une Eglise sont incapables de faire d'un pécheur un saint.

### <h3 id="question-118">Question 118</h3>

Dans une de vos conférences, vous avez déclaré que c'était une erreur d'envoyer des missionnaires dans les pays étrangers; que les religions pratiquées par les peuples dits païens sont actuellement bonnes pour eux; que fort heureusement les missionnaires n'ont encore fait jusqu'à présent que peu de mal. Comment donc expliquez-vous le commandement du Christ à Ses disciple, "Allez par tout le monde et prêchez la bonne nouvelle", (Marc 16:15)?

RÉPONSE - Le sens de cette parole du Christ repose évidemment sur l'interprétation du mot "monde". Si, par ce mot, nous entendons toute la terre, elle donnerait à penser qu'il est bon d'envoyer des missionnaires dans les pays étrangers; mais la Bible nous apprend que les disciples auxquels ce commandement avait été donné revinrent après avoir accompli leur mission, indiquant ainsi que ce mot ne pouvait signifier toute la terre. En ce sens, "monde" doit être interprété par "la contrée" ou "le pays". Au temps du Christ, les gens ne connaissaient pas le monde entier. L'extrémité ouest de l'Espagne s'appelle encore de nos jours le cap Finisterre - la fin de la terre. Ce mot, au moment où le Christ a donné son commandement, ne pouvait donc s'appliquer au monde entier tel que nous le connaissons aujourd'hui. Notre affirmation n'est donc pas contraire aux enseignements de la Bible. C'est une erreur d'envoyer des missionnaires vers des gens que nous appelons "païens", car leur présent développement ne leur permet pas de comprendre une religion qui prêche l'amour de ses semblables, religion que, même nous, n'avons pas encore appris à pratiquer! En outre, si les Anges de Justice, chargés de l'évolution humaine, sont capables de juger de nos besoins, et de placer chacun de nous dans le milieu où il trouvera les influences les plus favorables à son avancement, il faut croire qu'ils ont aussi donné à chaque nation la religion la plus salutaire à son épanouissement. En conséquence, lorsqu'un homme a été placé dans un pays où la religion Chrétienne est enseignée, c'est que cette religion renferme l'idéal qu'il doit s'efforcer d'atteindre, mais essayer de l'imposer à d'autres peuples qui ont été placés dans un entourage différent, c'est prétendre que notre propre jugement l'emporte sur celui de Dieu et de Ses Ministres, les Anges de Justice. Cependant, comme nous l'avons dit, les missionnaires ont fait peu de mal aux gens qu'ils sont allés convertir, mais ils auraient pu faire plus de bien autour d'eux sans partir. Nous n'avons pas besoin de quitter notre pays pour trouver des païens ayant besoin des enseignements de la Bible. A titre d' exemple, le professeur de Yale, Wilbur L. Cross, mentionne que dans un cours de quarante étudiants, pas un seul ne savait qui était Judas Iscariote; qu'il avait un étudiant Juif qui n'avait jamais entendu parle de Moïse. Si les missionnaires étaient mis en contact avec ces païens-là, peut-être pourraient-ils leur faire quelque bien.

Par contre, l'envoi de missionnaires orientaux chez les Occidentaux pour les convertire à l'Hindouisme et autres religions orientales similaires, fait plus de mal, car les adeptes de ces dernières enseignent des exercices respiratoires qui causent la folie ou la tuberculose, parce que nos corps occidentaux ne sont pas faits pour de telles pratiques. Il est plus sûr de s'en tenir à la religion de son propre pays, de l'étudier et de la pratiquer, laissant aux autres nations le privilège d'en faire de même avec la leur. 

<h2 id="section-5">Partie 5 - Questions Concernant les Phenomènes Spirites</h2>

### <h3 id="question-119">Question 119</h3>

La médiumnité peut-elle porter atteinte à la santé?

RÉPONSE - Cela dépend. Lorsqu'une personne devient le médium d'un esprit désincarné qui, prenant possession de son corps comme c'est le cas pour les médiums à transe, s'en sert comme s'il était à lui, il n'y a pas grand mal, pourvu que l'esprit-contrôle n'abuse pas de son privilège. En fait, il est certains cas où l'esprit-contrôle a de meilleures idées sur les soins à donner à un corps que le possesseur de ce corps lui-même, et il peut en améliorer la santé. Mais les esprits de nature hautement morale se servent rarement de médiums; ce sont plutôt des esprits attachés à la terre, des esprits inférieurs, tels que ceux des Amérindiens, qui agissent ainsi; et lorsqu'ils ont pris possession du corps d'une personne, il s'en servent pour satisfaire leurs viles passions pour la boisson et le sexe. Ils causent ainsi des troubles dans l'organisme et une détérioration du corps.

Dans le cas du médium à matérialisaiton, on peut dire que l'influence est toujours pernicieuse. L'esprit qui cherche à se matérialiser endort le médium et soutire l'éther de son corps vital par la rate, car la différence entre un médium à matérialisation et une personne ordinaire est le fait que le lien entre le corps vital et le corps physique est estrêmement relâché, ce qui donne la possibilité de retirer presque entièrement ce corps vital. Or, le corps vital est le véhicule par lequel les courants solaires qui nous donnent la vitalité sont spécialisés. Privé de son principe vitalisant, le corps du médium, pendant la matérialisation, se réduit quelque fois à la moitié de sa taille; ses chairs deviennent flasques et l'étincelle de vie qui l'anime est presque éteinte. Quand la séance est terminée et que le corps vital est remis en place, le médium se réveille et reprend sa conscience normale. Mais il éprouve une sensation d'épuisement extrême et, malheureusement, il a souvent recours à la boisson pour ranimer sa force vitale. Dans ce cas, naturellement, sa santé est bientôt affectée, et il devient une épave. A tous les points de vue, la médiumnité doit être évitée, car en plus du danger immédiat qu'elle cause au corps physique, il en résulte d'autres conséquences plus graves encore pour les véhicules subtils du médium, particulièrement dans l'après-vie.

### <h3 id="question-120">Question 120</h3>

Lorsque les médiums font ce qu'ils appellent des envolées d'âme, qu'est-ce qui quitte le corps physique? Celui-ci peut-il rester à l'état de veille pour se souvenir?

RÉPONSE - Un médium est un clairvoyant négatif ou involontaire, sous la domination d'un esprit du Monde du Désir. Il occupe la place de la victime d'un hypnotiseur du Monde Physique. Dans un cas d'hypnotisme, tant que la victime est éveillée, elle peut voir l'hypnotiseur, tandis que le médium ne voit l'esprit qui l'hypnotise que lorsqu'il a été chassé de son propre corps. Il est alors revêtu de son corps du désir, et par conséquent incapable, dans la plupart des cas, de se rappeler ses expériences.

Toutes les expériences du médium ont lieu alors que son corps physique est en état de transe. C'est l'Ego, revêtu de l'intellect et du corps du désir, qui quitte le corps physique, et la même séparation a lieu dans le sommeil ordinaire sans rêves, avec cette différence toutefois, que le corps physique n'est pas laissé inhabité, car l'esprit-contrôle entre habituellement dans le corps physique du médium, en prend possession et s'en sert selon son bon plaisir, bien souvent au détriment du médium. Car si un esprit-contrôle a été un ivrogne ou un libertin pendant sa vie terrestre, il se sert du corps de sa victime pour se livrer à sa passion pour la boisson et satisfaire ses bas instincts. Nous ne saurions trop répéter que le corps physique est notre instrument le plus précieux, et que c'est lui faire un tort immense que de l'abandonner à la merci d'un hypnotiseur ou d'un esprit-contrôle. Les médiums courent un danger encore plus grave, car il peut arriver que l'esprit-contrôle ne soit pas un Ego humain, mais un élémental qui ne peut fonctionner normalement dans le Monde Physique. Lorsque, après sa mort, le médium entre dans le Monde du Désir, l'élémental a pris un tel pouvoir sur son corps du désir qu'il peut le priver de ce véhicule. Or, le corps du désir est le ressort de l'action, et lorsque l'Ego est privé de ce véhicule, il n'y a rien qui le pousse à renaître. L'élémental peut même conserver ce corps pendant des millions d'années, et tandis que le reste de l'humanité évolue, le malheureux Ego, dépouillé de son corps du désir, reste inerte, et sera probablement bien en arrière de ses semblables avant qu'il ne soit affranchi de son esclavage. C'est pourquoi la médiumnité est, pour l'âme, le danger le plus grave que l'auteur connaisse et puisse concevoir, si ce n'est la pratique de la magie noire.

### <h3 id="question-121">Question 121</h3>

J'ai fait bien des envolées d'âme et, dans l'une d'elles, mon guide m'a mené, en passant par les portes d'une ville de cristal, dans un temple rempli d'êtres éthériques qui disaient, "C'est isi la cité sainte de Dieu." Voulez-vous me dire où cette cité est située, pourquoi il y a des portes et des murs autour de la ville et pourquoi tout y semble de cristal?

RÉPONSE - Une des particularités de la subtance-désir, matière du Monde du Désir, est d'être excessivement plastique et facilement modelée par la pensée. En un clin d'oeil, elle prend les formes les plus diverses selon la pensée qui l'anime, et lorsque les pensées d'un grand nombre de personnes suivent la même direction, ces pensées se groupent et forment un ensemble grandiose.

Ainsi, dans les régions inférieures du Monde du Désir, les pensées des gens qui croient à un Enfer embrasé, semblable à une fournaise ardente, font de la substance de ce lieu l'endroit de torture qu'ils imaginent. On peut y voir des démons cornus, aux pieds fourchus, à la queue terminée en lance, piquant les malheureux pécheurs avec leurs fourches. Il arrive souvent que les personnes ayant eu toute leur vie cette conception de l'enfer éprouvent, au moment de la mort, une grande frayeur à contempler cette vision qu'elles ont contribué à créer. Il y a aussi, dans les régions supérieures du Monde du Désir, une cité telle que celle que vous décrivez, une Nouvelle Jérusalem, avec ses portes de perles, sa mer de verre et son grand trône blanc sur lequel est assis une forme-pensée de Dieu sous l'apparence d'un vieillard. Il est probable que vous avez visité ces lieux et vu ces formes qui subsisteront dans le Monde du Désir tant que les gens se représenteront ainsi la Nouvelle Jérusalem, car ces formes n'ont de vie que celle que leur donnent les pensées entretenues par l'humanité. Lorsqu'à l'avenir celle-ci se sera élevée au-dessus de cette croyance, la cité créée par ses pensées cessera d'exister. L'apparence cristalline de cette cité est due à l'état brillant de la substance-désir dont elle est faite. C'est la raison pour laquelle les anciens alchimistes appelaient le Monde du Désir, monde "astral" ou "étoilé".

### <h3 id="question-122">Question 122</h3>

Les corps du désir quittés par les Egos qui avancent ne servent-ils pas à des élémentals pour tromper les amis et les parents des personnes décédées? Comment peut-on les détecter et les reconnaître?

RÉPONSE - A la mort, lorsque l'esprit, après être resté un temps plus ou moins long au Purgatoire, entre au Premier Ciel, il est encore revêtu du corps du désir dont il s'est servi pendant sa vie terrestre; ce n'est qu'en pénétrant au Deuxième Ciel qu'il le laisse derrière lui, comme il l'avait fait de son corps dense, d'abord, de son corps vital ensuite. Aussitôt que l'esprit a quitté le corps dense, ce dernier commence à se désagréger, mais il n'en est pas de même du corps du désir; ce corps est fait d'une substance vivifiée tellement plus fortement par l'Esprit Universel, qu'il conserve la capacité de se mouvoir, longtemps après que l'esprit l'a quitté. La coque du corps du désir subit une attraction magnétique vers ceux avec lesquels elle a été associée pendant la vie terrestre, et le souvenir de cette vie passée lui permet très souvent de se faire passer pour la personne défunte. Tel est particulièrement le cas lorsque c'est un élémental qui se sert de cette coque.

Ce sont ces coques vides, animées par les élémentals, qui expliquent la plupart des phénomènes obtenus dans les séances spirites. Les tours joués par ces élémentals qui jettent de l'eau dans le cou des assistants, renversent les tables, les chaises ou autres objets à leur portée, sont des exemples de l'usage qui peut être fait de ces coques vides.

Quant à la manière de les détecter ou de les reconnaître, nous savons évidemment que nos parents, nos amis défunts étaient doués de bon sens pendant leur vie terrestre, alors que ces coques vides ne peuvent nous fournir que des banalités n'ayant aucun sens. C'est pourquoi nous pouvons les juger d'après leurs paroles et leurs actes, comme nous le faisons pour les personnes ici- bas.

### <h3 id="question-123">Question 123</h3>

Les élémentals peuvent-ils affecter la forme d'un animal, d'un reptile, et que peut-on faire pour qu'ils arrêtent de le faire?

RÉPONSE - Dans notre monde matériel, toutes les formes sont stables et ne se modifient pas aisément. A cet égard, le Monde du Désir est tout à fait différent. Les métamorphoses narrées dans les contes de fées, telles les souris de Cendrillon transformées en laquais, ou la citrouille changée en carrosse, sont des faits réels dans le Monde du Désir, car les formes changent avec la rapidité de l'éclair selon la volonté de la vie qui les anime, ce qui désoriente le néophyte entrant dans ce monde. Il est donc nécessaire que le clairvoyant soit instruit afin d'échapper à l'illusion de la forme qui change continuellement et qui prend n'importe quelle configuration n'importe quand. Lorsque nous sommes capables de voir la vie qui anime toute chose, la forme dont elle se vêt n'a dès lors plus d'importance et ne nous abuse plus. 

Comme tout ce qui appartient au Monde du Désir, les élémentals ont cette faculté de changer de tournure, et c'est à ce fait que sont dus tant de récits ou de visions étranges que le clairvoyant non entraîné accepte comme réels. Rien ne peut empêcher les élémentals de changer de forme, mais nous avons le pouvoir de les chasser, comme nous chassons un chat qui donne une sérénade sous nos fenêtres.

Comment peut-on éviter d'être obsédé?

RÉPONSE - L'obsession est un état dans lequel un esprit désincarné a pris possession de manière permanente du corps d'une personne après en avoir dépossédé le propriétaire. Mais parfois des gens qui ont contracté des habitudes d'ivrognerie ou d'autres vices cherchent à s'en défendre en disant qu'ils sont obsédés. On peut être à peu près sûr que cette explication n'est qu'une excuse, car un voleur qui a dérobé quelque chose, ici-bas, ne va pas raconter à tout le monde ce qu'il a fait; et une entité qui a pris possession d'un corps ne s'en vante pas. Elle ne se soucie guère de ce que l'on peut dire de l'homme dont elle a dérobé le corps, aussi n'y a-t-il aucune raison pour qu'elle en parle et court ainsi le risque d'être exorcisée.

Il y a un moyen infaillible de savoir si une personne est vraiment obsédée, et c'est par le diagnostic de l'oeil, "Les yeux sont le miroir de l'âme" et seul le véritable possesseur du corps est capable d'en contracter et en dilater la pupille. En examinant dans une pièce sombre l'oeil d'une personne que l'on croit obsédée, ou qui prétend l'être, il y a obsession si la pupille ne se dilate pas. En ce cas, la pupille de la personne examinée ne se contracte pas non plus sous l'influence des rayons du Soleil, ou si nous lui faisons lire de petits caractères, qu'elle ne se dilate si nous l'obligeons à regarder un objet lointain. En un mot, la pupille, s'il y a obsession, n'est impressionnée ni par la lumière, ni par la distance. Il y a cependant une certaine affection, appelée ataxie locomotrice, qui empêche la pupille de répondre à la distance, mais elle est, toutefois, impressionnée par la lumière.

Nulle personne qui garde une attitude d'esprit positive ne peut être obsédée; car tant que nous affirmons notre personnalité, cela est suffisant pour tenir éloignés tous les intrus. Mais dans les séances spirites où les assistants sont passifs, il y a toujours un grand danger d'obsession. Toute personne portée à être négative devrait éviter d'y assister, éviter de fixer une boule de cristal et s'interdire les autres méthodes d'évoquer les esprits. C'est une très mauvaise habitude, car ceux qui ont passé dans l'au-delà ont terminé leur tâche ici-bas, et ne doivent pas y être rappelés.

### <h3 id="question-125">Question 125</h3>

Qu'est-ce que la psychométrie?

RÉPONSE - La science nous enseigne que toute particule de matière du Monde Physique est interpénétrée d'éther, en sorte que les atomes chimiques de toute substance, si dense soit-elle, ne se touchent pas, mais que chacun vibre dans un champ de cet éther qui se répand partout. Les vibrations de cet éther, émises par chaque objet, portent à nos yeux l'image de toutes les choses qui nous entourent. Cette image n'est pas perdue. Les images de toutes les choses que nous avons consciemment observées existent dans l'éther de notre corps vital, et le souvenir que nous en avons dépend de notre pouvoir de les rappeler.

L'éther qui pénètre chaque objet garde aussi l'image de milieu où il se trouve. Sur les murs des pièces de notre demeure sont inscrits tous les incidents, toutes les scènes qui s'y sont déroulées, et quand bien même nous en changerions les lattes et le plâtre, il pourrait être impossible de se débarrasser de toutes les images qui s'y sont gravées. Si nous portons à une personne douée de la vue éthérique un morceau de plâtre d'une chambre, il est possible à celle-ci de voir l'éther de ce morceau de plâtre et de parler des scènes qui se sont déroulées à cet endroit. Un morceau de pierre provenant des Pyramides d'Egypte les ferait voir à cette personne tout aussi bien que si on lui en présentait des photographies, car c'est l'éther de l'objet même qui impressionne le film d'un appareil photographique; et la seule différence entre cette impression et celle que reçoit notre oeil est que la photographie rend possible la fixation de l'image sur le film, et que nous pouvons regarder la photographie quand bon nous semble, tandis que nous ne sommes pas encore capables, dans les circonstances présentes, de visualiser clairement les scènes de notre passé. Mais le psychomètre, capable de lire l'éther, a une merveilleuse galerie de tableaux à sa disposition.

### <h3 id="question-126">Question 126</h3>

Est-il vrai que, parfois, au cours de séances spirites, des personnes sont transportées d'un endroit à l'autre par des mains invisibles, que des fleurs sont apportées dans la pièce alors que les fenêtres et les portes sont closes, et s'il en est ainsi, comment cela se produit-il?

RÉPONSE - Oui, il est parfaitement vrai que de tels phénomènes ont lieu parfois, dans des conditions où toute fraude est impossible. Quant au déplacement des objets, il peut se faire de diverses manières par les esprits qui dirigent ces séances. Des mains peuvent être matérialisées, visibles ou invisibles, et soulever les objets ou les personnes, ou les transporter d'un endroit à l'autre; ou bien les objets en question peuvent être soustraits à la loi de la pesanteur. Quant au passage de fleurs à travers un mur, une fenêtre fermée, ou un autre objet matériel, nous devrions nous rappeler que les objets ne sont pas aussi compacts qu'on le croit généralement. La science reconnaît qu'il n'y a pas deux atomes d'aucune matière qui se touchent, mais que chaque atome oscille et vibre à un taux variable de vitesse, dans l'océan d'éther qui pénètre toute matière. On sait aussi que toutes les substances peuvent être réduites à l'état gazeux. Le fer, la pierre, l'eau ou n'importe quelle autre substance peut être ainsi réduite. Si nous concevons nettement cela, il n'y a qu'un pas à faire pour concevoir l'idée d'une fleur qui se résoudrait en un état gazeux, passerait ainsi entre les atomes d'un mur, pour reprendre sa forme première. Et c'est, en effet, ce qui a lieu.

L'auteur de la question dira peut-être, "d'accord, mais si vous prenez une pièce d'argent, que vous la fondiez dans un creuset, ou que vous la changiez en gaz, ce n'est pas la forme d'une pièce d'argent qu'elle reprendra lorsqu'elle retournera à l'état métallique, car ce sera une simple masse de métal fondu". Cela est vrai lorsque l'opération est faite par un homme ordinaire, incapable de séparer la matière dense de sa contrepartie éthérique pendant la fusion, mais les entités spirituelles qui accomplissent ces exploits savent comment séparer la partie éthérique de la fleur de la partie dense. Et c'est la partie éthérique qui retient la configuration, et forme la matrice ou le moule qui donne forme à la matière dont la fleur est composée, lorsque cette matière est libérée dans la chambre après avoir passé à travers le mur.

### <h3 id="question-127">Question 127</h3>

Voulez-vous bien expliquer l'usage de la planchette à écrire et dire s'il est à conseiller d'essayer de produire le phénomène entre amateurs?

RÉPONSE - Il s'agit d'une planchette montée sur des roulements à billes et munie d'une appendice permettant d'y fixer un crayon, en sorte que lorsque la main du médium, placée sur la planchette, est mue par les esprits, le crayon écrit leurs messages sur une feuille de papier. Comme tous les autres phénomènes spirites, celui de la planchette à écrire est produit par des esprits désincarnés, par l'intermédiaire d'un médium négatif.

Lorsqu'une entité a quitté cette vie terrestre pour entrer dans l'au-delà invisible, une évolution d'une nature différente de la nôtre l'attend au Purgatoire et dans les différents Ciels. C'est donc pour elle une rétrogradation que d'essayer de communiquer avec nous, dans des circonstances ordinaires. Ainsi, tout phénomène spirite qui ramène l'esprit désincarné en contact avec le Monde Physique est déconseillé comme ayant un effet néfaste sur les esprits ainsi rappelés. D'autre part, les entités communiquant avec nous dans une réunion spirite sont dangereuses pour les assistants passifs qui leur abandonnent, jusqu'à un certain point, leur pouvoir de volonté et leur corps.

Bien entendu, dans cette pratique de la planchette à écrire, le corps n'entre par forcément tout entier en transe, bien que cela arrive quelquefois, mais le bras, tout au moins, est abandonné au contrôle de l'esprit désincarné que le médium ne voit pas et qui est peut-être, mais qui peut aussi ne pas être, ce qu'il prétend. Si un vagabond se présentait à notre porte pour nous persuader de lui abandonner notre maison et de lui permettre d'en prendre possession pendant un moment, nous la lui refuserions avec indignation; mais lorsqu'un vagabond du Monde du Désir nous demande de prendre possession de cette maison bien plus précieuse qu'est notre corps, beaucoup y consentent aussitôt, flattés dans leur conviction qu'un "cher Ange" est venu les visiter. Mais les "chers Anges" ne sont pas plus nombreux dans le Monde du Désir que les philanthropes ici-bas. On ne saurait trop répéter que la mort n'a pas de pouvoir transformateur; l'ignorant ne devient pas tout à coup un sage parce qu'il a passé de ce monde dans l'autre. De même qu'il est nécessaire d'étudier dans le Monde Physique pour acquérir des connaissances, ainsi les esprits désincarnés doivent s'appliquer, s'ils désirent étudier les conditions du monde dans lequel ils sont entrés, et jusqu'à ce qu'ils aient acquis la somme d'expérience nécessaire, ils ne sont pas plus capables de nous servir de guides là-haut qu'ils ne l'étaient ici-bas. Le plus sûr parti est de se garder de tout phénomène négatif, de concentrer nos énergies à "vivre la vie" et de pratiquer les exercices qui développent en nous la faculté d'entrer à volonté dans ce monde, soit en y voyageant dans nos véhicules subtils, soit en l'observant par la clairvoyance, en restant dans notre corps dense. C'est cela progresser; lorsque nous aurons cette capacité, nous pourrons voir les entités désincarnées face à face, et juger par nous-même s'il est sage ou non d'écouter leurs conseils. Jusque-là, le désavantage est de notre côté, et nous devons nous tenir sur nos gardes.

### <h3 id="question-128">Question 128</h3>

Un vampire est-il la même chose qu'un loup-garou?

RÉPONSE - Non, un vampire est une personne qui absorbe la vitalité d'une autre, tandis que ce qu'on appelait loup-garou, au Moyen Age, était le corps vital d'un magicien noir d'ordre inférieur. Il donnait une forme effrayante à son corps vital qu'il garnissait en partie de matière dense afin de faire du mal à ceux qu'il voulait atteindre. Dans les vieilles légendes, on rappelle qu'il ne servait à rien de frapper des loups-garous, ces coups ne pouvant leur faire de mal, mais si l'on réussissait à ler percer avec un couteau ou quelqu'autre instrument tranchant, ils se mettaient à dégorger le sang de leurs victimes, et se sauvaient précipitamment vers leur demeure en hurlant. Là, on pouvait trouver le magicien qui avait pris la forme d'un loup-garou souffrant d'une blessure à l'endroit même où l'animal avait été frappé. Ceci se produit par une circonstance curieuse que les occultistes appellent répercussion, et le même phénomène peut être observé au cours des séances spirites où des esprits se matérialisent. L'éther dans lequel ces esprits se matérialisent a été soutiré du corps du médium, et si un morceau du vêtement de cet esprit est coupé, un même morceau manquera à celui du médium à la fin de la séance. Des chercheurs sceptiques, ignorant la loi de répercussion, se sont servis de ce fait pour accuser les médiums de fraude, alors qu'ils étaient parfaitement honnêtes, bien qu'incapables d'expliquer l'évidence semblant les accuser.

### <h3 id="question-129">Question 129</h3>

Quelle est la différence entre un médium à transe, un médium à matérialisation, un clairvoyant exercé et une personne ordinaire?

RÉPONSE - Généralement parlant, l'humanité se divise en deux groupes; ceux chez lesquels le lien entre le corps vital et le corps dense est très resserré, et ceux chez lesquels il est plus relâché. Le premier groupe comprend les personnes ordinaires, dont les occupations sont toutes matérielles et qui sont hors de tout contact avec les Mondes Spirituels. Le second groupe, comprenant des personnes que l'on qualifie de sensitives, se subdivise en deux classes dont l'une est dirigée par une volonté intérieure. Elle est positive. Cette classe comprend le clairvoyant exercé et l'Aide Invisible. L'autre classe est négative et soumise à la volonté des autres. C'est dans cette classe que se recrutent les médiums.

Lorsque le lien entre le corps vital et le corps dense de l'homme est quelque peu relâché, il est sensible aux vibrations spirituelles. S'il est de nature positive, il développera par sa propre volonté ses facultés spirituelles, vivra une vie spirituelle et, avec le temps, recevra l'enseignement nécessaire pour devenir un clairvoyant exercé maître de sa faculté en tout temps, et libre d'exercer ou non celle-ci, selon selon désir.

Si une personne de nature négative possède ce même relâchement entre les corps vital et dense, elle court le risque de devenir, comme médium, la proie d'esprits désincarnés.

Là où le lien entre le corps vital et le corps dense est relâché au point que le premier puisse se retirer du second, le sujet, s'il est de nature positive, peut devenir un Aide Invisible, capable de séparer à volonté les deux éthers supérieurs des deux éthers inférieurs et de les employer comme véhicule de perception sensorielle et de mémoire. Il peut fonctionner consciemment dans le Monde Spirituel et en rapporter le souvenir de tout ce qu'il y a fait, de sorte que, lorsqu'il quitte son corps dense la nuit, il prend part consciemment aux activités du Monde Invisible, comme nous faisons notre devoir ici-bas, le matin, à notre réveil.

Lorsqu'une personne de nature négative possède ce relâchement entre le corps vital et le corps dense, les esprits retenus à la terre, et qui cherchent à s'y manifester, peuvent soutirer son corps vital par la rate, se servir temporairement de l'éther dont ce corps est composé pour se matérialiser, et rendre cet éther au médium lorsque la séance spirite est terminée.

### <h3 id="question-130">Question 130</h3>

Si la médiumnité est si dangereuse, pourquoi les médiums ne cessent-ils pas de permettre qu'on se serve d'eux?

RÉPONSE - En premier lieu, naturellement, la grande majorité des médiums ne se rendent pas compte qu'il y a un danger. Ils sont en particulier inconscients du danger énorme qui les menace après la mort. Leur corps du désir peut alors être accaparé par l'esprit-contrôle qui s'est servi d'eux de leur vivant. S'ils essayaient, alors qu'ils sont encore dans leur corps physique ici-bas, de mettre fin à l'influence de l'esprit-contrôle, ils découvriraient que cette entité exerce un contrôle extrêmement fort sur eux, qu'il leur est difficile de faire cesser, et ils comprendraient que, lorsque la mort les amènera dans le monde de ces esprits-contrôles, le danger sera bien entendu plus grand encore.

L'auteur a connu des cas où des médiums ont voulu se dérober à l'esprit- contrôle et se défaire de ses liens, mais ils n'ont pu rompre la forte emprise de l'entité. Ils étaient impuissants. Certains médiums se sont adressés à l'auteur pour lui demander de l'aide, disant qu'ils étaient presque irrésistiblement contraints par leurs esprits-contrôles à se suicider, à commettre un crime, qu'ils avaient prié, supplié, mais en vain, ces esprits- contrôles de les laisser en paix. Il y a d'autres cas où des esprits- contrôles ont arraché impitoyablement leurs victimes de leur lit, au milieu de la nuit, contre leur volonté, pour les harceler. Bien rares sont les cas où ils ont montré quelque pitié. Parmi les nombreux cas où la santé des médiums a été affectée par de tels traitements, l'auteur n'en connaît qu'un où la maladie du médium a amené les esprits-contrôles à écouter ses supplications, à cesser de l'importuner pendant quelques mois pour lui permettre de se rétablir.

Ainsi, on peut voir qu'une fois entré dans la médiumnité, ce n'est généralement plus pour le médium une question de choix; il a perdu le pouvoir d'interdire l'entrée de son corps aux esprits-contrôles. Tant qu'ils obéissent docilement à leurs oppresseurs, les médiums ne sentent peut-être pas le mors qui leur est appliqué; mais que l'un d'eux tente de se dérober, et il ne tardera pas à se rendre compte que l'esprit-contrôle possède à la fois le mors et les éperons, dont il fait usage impitoyablement. 

<h2 id="section-6">Partie 6 - Questions Concernant la Clairvoynce</h2>

### <h3 id="question-131">Question 131</h3>

Quelle est la différence entre un Clairvoyant, un Initié et un Adepte?

RÉPONSE - Ce qu'un homme voit dépend de la sensibilité de son oeil. Certaines personnes peuvent distinguer à une certaine distance des objets invisibles pour d'autres. Les artistess perçoivent des nuances que les personnes ordinaires ne peuvent discerner; d'autres sont daltoniennes, alors que les aveugles sont incapables de rien voir.

Ceux qui peuvent voir le plus loin ou qui distinguent les nuances les plus délicates sont plus clairvoyants que les autres; autrement dit, leur vue est plus développée.

La majorité d'entre nous sommes capables de voir la plupart des choses qui nous entourent, mais nous ne connaissons pas ces choses du seul fait de les voir. Nous avons dû nous initier à l'usage du téléphone, de la bicyclette, de l'automobile, du piano, etc.

Mais, bien que nous sachions nous servir de ces instruments, dans des circonstances ordinaires, nous ne sommes pas assez familiarisés avec leur mécanisme pour être capables de les construire ou de les réparer en cas de besoin. Avant d'être qualifiés pour ce travail, il faudrait suivre un cours d'instruction spécial, et en nous y appliquant de tout notre coeur, nous pouvons devenir des adeptes dans cette branche particulière.

Si nous rapprochons cet exemple de la question qui nous occupe, nous comprendrons qu'un Clairvoyant est un homme dont le sens de la vue s'est étendu à un tel point qu'il perçoit un autre monde, invisible à la plupart d'entre nous, et qu'il est capable de voir tout ce qui s'y trouve.

Cependant il n'a pas l'"entière connaissance" de tout ce qu'il aperçoit, du simple fait qu'il est capable de l'apercevoir, pas plus que nous ne connaissons tout ce que nous voyons dans ce monde-ci. Il doit s'appliquer à acquérir cette connaissance. Ainsi, par degrés, il deviendra un Initié, comprenant les choses qu'il voit ,et il sera capable d'en manipuler quelques- unes dans des circonstances ordinaires, de la même façon que nous sommes capables de jouer du piano ou de faire de la bicyclette, lorsque nous avons appris à le faire.

Pour exercer son pouvoir sur les objets et sur les forces du monde invisible en qualité d'Adepte, l'Initié aura besoin d'une formation plus complète.

Ainsi, le Clairvoyant voit le monde invisible; l'Initié voit le monde invisible et il comprend ce qu'il voit; l'Adepte voit le monde invisible, comprend ce qu'il voit et a pouvoir sur les choses et les forces qui s'y trouvent.

### <h3 id="question-132">Question 132</h3>

Pourquoi les clairvoyants exercés n'offrent-ils pas de se prêter à quelques expériences simples mais concluantes? Réalisées par des hommes de science, ces expériences convaincraient tout le monde de la réalité de certaines facultés dépassant les organes des sens.

RÉPONSE - En premier lieu, les clairvoyants exercés ne poursuivent aucun but d'intérêt personnel; ils ne se soucient nullement de ce que les gens croient ou ne croient pas. Alors que, pour nous, cela aurait une très grande importance que nous puissions croire, pour le clairvoyant lui-même cela ne fait absolument aucune différence. Jamais le clairvoyant ne recherche l'argent ou toute autre considération de la part de gens convaincus; il ne désire aucun pouvoir temporel, ne fait jamais étalage de ses facultés et ne s'en vante pas. S'ils en parle, ce n'est qu'avec une extrême modestie. S'il accomplit des actes méritoires, en venant en aide à ses semblables, par exemple, il ne tient pas à ce que ces actes soient connus. Et sa main gauche ignore habituellement le bien que fait sa main droite.

Un aveugle ne voit ni la lumière ni les couleurs, bien que celles-ci soient partout présentent autour de lui, et s'il nous demandait de nous soumettre à des épreuves qui lui prouveraient sans doute aucun que nous percevons bien la lumière et les couleurs, nous serions fort embarrassés pour trouver quelles expériences pourraient le convaincre de ces réalités. Il en est de même du clairvoyant exercé qui se demande quelles expériences seraient susceptibles de convaincre tout le monde. On n'a pas encore présenté d'expériences, à ce jour, qui se soient montrées assez concluantes pour ne pas susciter le besoin d'autres explications. Et le malheureux clairvoyant qui se prêterait à de telles exigences devrait les poursuivre sans fin, et des générations de sceptiques continueraient de le traiter d'imposteur. On lui demanderait de se soumettre aux demandes des hommes de science, de chacun en particulier, alors qu'ils ne se fient pas eux-mêmes à leurs propres yeux. Si leur raison leur dit qu'une chose est impossible, ils refusent d'y croire, même lorsqu'on leur démontre le contraire. Les scientifiques sont obligés de se contenter d'expériences faites d'après les lois de la nature, lorsqu'ils se livrent à leurs propres recherches, en chimie par exemple, mais ils s'arrogent le droit de prescrire certaines conditions au clairvoyant quand il s'agit de questions supraphysiques au sujet desquelles ils s'avouent tout à fait ignorants. C'est ainsi que lorsque des médiums requièrent une chambre obscure pour réaliser leurs expériences, les hommes de science de dire, 

"cela ne prouve-t-il pas que ces médiums ne sont que des imposteurs? Ils veulent une chambre obscure pour qu'on ne puisse voir comment se jouent leurs tours!" Les médiums ne savent habituellement pas pourquoi la chambre doit être obscure, et n'en peuvent donner l'explication, mais une loi est à la base de leur demande.

La voici: les rayons de la lumière mettent l'éther en vibration violente, et il est difficile, dans ces conditions, aux entités cherchant à se manifester, de travailler l'éther, de le mouler en un corps, un organe vocal, une main ou toute autre manifestation matérielle. Plus la chambre est sombre, moins l'éther vibre, et plus il est facile à ces entités de s'en servir pour réaliser les phénomènes spirites.

Il y a de nombreuses autres lois à la base des phénomènes supraphysiques dont la science n'a aucune idée, et cette ignorance même disqualifie de prime abord les hommes de science pour prescrire leurs conditions. Cependant, le chemin de la connaissance directe leur reste ouvert. Ils nous disent, "procurez-vous un certain nombre de lentilles, de certaines formes, placez-les dans un tube, d'une certaine manière, dirigez le tout vers le ciel, dans une certaine direction, et vous verrez huit lunes accomplissant leur révolution autour de Saturne". Si nous nous conformons à leurs directives, nous verrons que ce qu'ils nous ont annoncé est bien là, en effet. Mais si nous refusons de nous procurer l'instrument nécessaire, nous ne pouvons pas voir les lunes de Saturne. Nous leur disons donc, "vivez la vie sainte, comme il convient, faites les exercices qui vous permettent de développer en vous la faculté dont nous parlons. Vous verrez alors que ce que nous vous avons dit est la vérité, et vous serez obligés de reconnaître vous-mêmes ce que nous avançons". S'ils refusent de se soumettre à nos directives, ils resteront incrédules au sujet des plans supraphysiques autant que l'homme qui, faute de se procurer un télescope mettrait en doute l'existence des lunes de Saturne, toutes choses dont le clairvoyant entraîné se préoccupe.

### <h3 id="question-133">Question 133</h3>

Si la clairvoyance est un moyen d'investigation si précis, une faculté si hautement spirituelle, pourquoi est-elle généralement le partage de gens peu instruits, sortant de milieux vulgaires, ayant apparemment peu de spiritualité et qui disent souvent des mensonges?

RÉPONSE - Dans un passé lointain, bien lointain, il y eut un temps où le corps humain était un organisme bien moins compliqué qu'il ne l'est aujourd'hui, avant que le système nerveux cérébro-spinal n'ait été développé pour donner à l'homme la maîtrise de son corps. En ce temps-là, le système nerveux sympathique ou involontaire se chargeait des fonctions purement animales, à peu près comme il le fait aujourd'hui. L'homme était alors un être bien plus spirituel qu'il ne l'est maintenant, et ses moyens de perception des Mondes Spirituels étaient des organes qui ne sont aujourd'hui temporairement pas en usage. Nous avons dans notre corps nombre d'organes à divers degrés d'évolution, dont certains s'atrophient, parce qu'ils ont cessé d'être utiles. Par exemple, les muscles qui font mouvoir les oreilles de certains animaux sont encore présents chez l'homme, mais ils ne sont plus nécessaires, et la plupart d'entre nous en ont perdu l'usage. D'autres organes sont en train de se développer: le coeur, par exemple, muscle involontaire, qui est en train d'être investis de stries transversales comme les muscles volontaires et qui, dans l'avenir, se développera comme tel, et pourra battre au rythme désiré.

D'autres organes sont simplement en repos. Parmi ceux-ci il y a le corps pituitaire et la glande pinéale. S'ils ne devaient pas servir dans l'avenir, ils s'atrophieraient, comme tous les organes qui ont cessé d'être utiles. Dans un lointain passé, ces deux organes étaient reliés au système nerveux sympathique et douaient l'homme de clairvoyance involontaire. Et grâce à leur connexion avec le système cérébro-spinal, ils rendront à l'avenir l'humanité capable d'entrer en contact à volonté avec les Mondes Spirituels.

Il est plus facile de faire rouler une pierre du haut d'une colline que de l'y faire remonter; il est plus facile de rétrograder que de progresser, c'est pourquoi, en cherchant à se développer d'une façon négative, on renouvelle aisément l'activité négative du corps pituitaire et de la glande pinéale, et l'on devient un clairvoyant négatif. Mais comme aucune des facultés exercées au moyen du système nerveux involontaire ne relève du pouvoir de la volonté, cette faculté est, naturellement, intermittente chez les médiums. Par moment, lorsque le "courant" passe, ils peuvent de manière limitée entrer en contact avec les Mondes Spirituels. Il arrive cependant que faute de "courant", ils soient incapables de rien voir. Ils simulent alors, afin d'assurer leur gagne- pain.

Celui qui développe consciemment ses facultés spirituelles maîtrise la vibration des deux petits organes précités par le pouvoir de la volonté et n'a pas de jour "creux". Le pouvoir de voir dans les Mondes Spirituels lui est acquis en tout temps. Ainsi, dans ses mains, la clairvoyance est un moyen d'investigation précis, mais il faut comprendre pourtant qu'il est tout aussi nécessaire de faire des investigations dans ces mondes avant de les connaître, qu'il n'est nécessaire d'en effectuer ici-bas. De nombreuses personnes sont sottement sceptiques concernant l'existence des mondes et des sens supraphysiques, mais celles qui pensent que lorsqu'un homme "voit" dans les Mondes Invisibles", il sait immédiatement tout de ces mondes, sont sottes également. Un aveugle qui a acquis la faculté de la vue grâce à une opération doit apprendre à observer le Monde Physique, et on le verra souvent fermer les yeux au début, car n'ayant pas encore appris à mesurer les distances, il lui est plus facile de se conduire par le toucher que par la vue. Le petit enfant qui cherche à attrapper la Lune ou à atteindre un objet de l'autre côté de la pièce en est aussi un exemple. "Ce qui est en bas est comme ce qui est en haut"; avant qu'une personne ne se soit exercée, le simple fait qu'elle soit clairvoyante n'est pas pour elle d'une grande utilité, et l'idée que parce qu'elle voit, elle connaît nécessairement toutes choses, est illogique. Nous qui avons habité ce monde toute notre vie, n'en avons qu'une connaissance bien restreinte. En outre, les formes du Monde Physique sont stables et ne se modifient pas facilement, alors que la question de vision et des connaissances est compliquée, dans les Mondes Intérieurs, par la plasticité des formes qui changent souvent en un clin d'oeil, en réponse aux pensées des entités qui y fonctionnent.

Développer la clairvoyance volontaire est une tâche ardue; c'est pourquoi peu de gens possèdent cette faculté, tandis que la clairvoyance négative est, malheureusement, développée par de nombreuses personnes qui n'ont pas d'idéals élevés pour les empêcher de prostituer leur faculté pour de l'argent.

### <h3 id="question-134">Question 134</h3>

Qu'entend-on par initiation? Pourquoi les Initiés sont-ils tous des hommes?

RÉPONSE - L'initiation est, en général, considérée comme une admission dans un ordre secret, moyennant des honoraires d'initiation; mais l'initiation occulte est très différente.

Lorsqu'une personne s'est efforcée de vivre la vie supérieure pendant un certain temps, a purifié ses véhicules par ses efforts mentaux, moraux et physiques, elle émet une lumière dans le monde invisible, et accumule un pouvoir intérieur. Il arrive un moment où ce pouvoir doit trouver une issue. Alors, dans sa vie apparaît un instructeur qui lui montre le pouvoir qu'elle a cultivé, souvent inconsciemment, et lui en indique l'usage. Cette démonstration s'appelle initiation. Elle peut avoir lieu ou non dans un temple; elle peut être accompagnée ou non d'une cérémonie. Mais qu'il soit bien compris qu'aucune cérémonie ne peut donner à l'aspirant les pouvoirs dont l'initiation lui enseigne l'usage, pas plus que la détente de la gâchette d'un pistolet non chargé ne peut produire une explosion. La cérémonie n'a d'autre valeur que d'être le couronnement de la vie du disciple.

Il est donc évident que l'initiation est le résultat infaillible du mérite. Elle n'est jamais vendue pour de l'argent, bien qu'il ne manque pas de charlatans sans scrupules offrant d'initier tout venant dans les arts occultes - auxquels ils ne connaissent rien eux-mêmes - pas plus qu'il ne manque de gens crédules assez fous pour s'y laisser prendre, et de personnes malhonnêtes qui espèrent ainsi obtenir un pouvoir néfaste sur leurs semblables. Simon, le sorcier, (Actes 8:20-23), a encouru le blâme sévère de Pierre lorsqu'il tenta d'acheter à prix d'or son pouvoir spirituel; on peut donc se demander quelle juste condamnation attend ceux qui offrent comme une denrée commerciale une marchandise que, dans la nature des choses, ils sont incapables de fournir. L'auteur de la question se méprend lorsqu'il croit que seuls les hommes sont initiés, du moins en ce qui concerne les Mystères Mineurs. Il y a des femmes qui sont initiées, et parfois même les Initiés des Mystères Majeurs prennent un corps féminin dans le but d'accomplir une certaine tâche. Il est vrai, cependant, que ceux qui sont assez avancés pour avoir le choix en ce qui concerne le sexe préfèrent un corps masculin, et la raison en est facile à comprendre. La femme, ayant un corps vital positif et un corps dense négatif, se trouve quelque peu désavantagée dans le monde tel qu'il est constitué à présent. En luttant pour des idéals supérieurs et en vivant la vie supérieure, nous spiritualisons le corps vital et le transmuons en âme qui est toujours positive, elle - c'est là un pouvoir qui n'a rien à voir avec le sexe - et lorsque l'Initié a aussi un corps physique masculin, il est entièrement positif dans le Monde Physique, et il a plus de chances d'avancement qu'en utilisant un corps féminin.

### <h3 id="question-135">Question 135</h3>

N'est-ce pas le devoir de celui qui est instruit sur les sujets concernant la vie supérieure d'instruire et d'aider ceux qui le sont moins?

RÉPONSE - Certainement. Le savoir est l'une des choses que nous pouvons donner tout en le conservant nous-même. En fait, lorsque nous aidons les autres en leur faisant partager nos connaissances, nous nous rendons service à nous- mêmes, en augmentant notre savoir. Car on ne sait vraiment une chose que lorsqu'on l'a dite et expliquée à d'autres, et n'oublions pas que, quelles que soient les connaissances que nous ayons, elles ne sont pas notre propriété exclusive, mais doivent servir au bien universel. Si nous les conservons égoïstement et refusons d'éclairer autrui, nous arriverons au même résultat qu'en continuant à manger, alors que l'élimination ne se fait pas convenablement. Il viendra un moment où nous ne pourrons plus manger et deviendrons malade. Il en est de même de ceux qui ont acquis des connaissances concernant les choses de la vie supérieure. Lorsqu'ils les accumulent au lieu d'en faire bénéficier autrui, ils sont portés à vivre en reclus et peuvent en perdre la raison.

### <h3 id="question-136">Question 136</h3>

Quelles sont les qualifications nécessaires pour devenir un Aide Invisible? La vie entière doit-elle être consacrées aux efforts spirituels?

RÉPONSE - Non, pas du tout; en fait, personne n'a pas le droit de consacrer sa vie entière aux efforts spirituels à moins qu'il n'ait rempli tout d'abord les obligations matérielles qui lui incombent à l'égard d'autrui. Les devoirs dans le cadre de la famille sont le moyen d'être un aide visible, et l'on ne peut attendre d'une personne qui s'est soustraite à ses devoirs ici-bas, qu'elle remplisse ceux d'un Aide Invisible de l'autre côté du voile.

Une patiente persévérance dans l'accomplissement de tous nos devoirs terrestres, remplis au mieux de nos capacités est la première qualification de l'aspirant, et la plus essentielle. Comme autre qualité on peut citer la maîtrise de soi. Tant que nous vivons travaillons dans notre corps dense, le corps du désir est, dans une certaine mesure, tenu en échec par son emprison nement dans la matière physique dense. Si nous nous emportons ici-bas, le résultat peut être dangereux pour nous-mêmes et pour ceux qui nous entourent, mais il n'est pas comparable au danger qui accompagne un accès de colère dans l'autre monde, car nous savons que notre corps du désir, sous l'effet d'un emportement très passager, peut affecter notre corps physique jusqu'à nous rendre malade pendant des semaines. Mais en dehors de notre corps physique, si la force du corps du désir était dirigée contre quelqu'un d'autre, elle pourrait sur-le-champ faire mourir une armée.

La connaissance est une autre qualité demandée à l'aspirant. A moins d'avoir étudié les conditions de l'après-vie, de s'être familiarisé avec le plan de l'évolution, d'avoir une idée d'ensemble de la constitution de l'homme et des sujets similaires, il nous est impossible d'instruire ceux qui ont moins de connaissance, et d'assumer les tâches d'un Aide Invisible; cela reviendrait à envoyer un ignorant enseigner dans une école.

La dernière qualité, non des moindres, requise d'un Aide Invisible, est qu'il doit être pénétré d'un amour qui englobe l'humanité tout entière. Nous ne pouvons pas être insensible aux souffrances de nos semblables ici-bas, et simultanément être rempli d'amour et du désir d'aider dans l'autre monde, pas plus que celui qui ne connaît pas une note de musique n'est capable de devenir, par le seul fait de la mort, un musicien remarquable ou d'acquérir une telle passion de la musique qu'il désire passer l'éternité à souffler dans une trompette ou à pincer de la harpe. En conclusion, nous répétons que, pour devenir un Aide Invisible dans l'au-delà, nous devons d'abord nous qualifier en aidant ici-bas.

### <h3 id="question-137">Question 137</h3>

A quoi sert-il de sortir de son corps?

RÉPONSE - Au degré actuel de notre évolution, la plupart des humains sont liés à leur corps pendant la vie terrestre. Ils sont placés dans un milieu limité, parce qu'ils ont à y apprendre des leçons qui ne peuvent être comprises qu'en perdant de vue toute autre considération. Mais il vient un moment où l'homme a acquis un savoir suffisant pour jouir d'une plus grande liberté d'action dans ses activités. Son corps devient alors pour lui un boulet, une entrave, qu'il est opportun de quitter de temps à autre. En conséquence, les Frères Aînés lui enseignent à s'en extraire à volonté. Eux-mêmes ont été aidés dans le passé par des êtres plus avancés, venus d'autres planètes; ils sont, à leur tour, capables de rendre le même service à des humains moins évolués.

Le but cherché en sortant de notre corps est d'acquérir une plus grande connaissance. Mais cette connaissance n'est que le moyen de parvenir à une fin, qui est d'aider les autres dans leur avancement. C'est pourquoi ceux qui sont capables de quitter leur corps physique sont connus sous le nom d'Aides Invisibles. Leur tâche consiste à aider les vivants et les morts selon leurs aptitudes.

### <h3 id="question-138">Question 138</h3>

Est-il absolument nécessaire de vivre une vie d'ascétisme pour se développer spirituellement et pour acquérir des pouvoirs psychiques?

RÉPONSE - La réponse dépend de ce que l'auteur de la question entend par ascétisme. Il y a en Orient des gens qui se roulent dans un tonneau hérissé de pointes, afin de mortifier la chair, ou qui se flagellent et se mutilent de diverses manières dans le but d'acquérir des pouvoirs spirituels. Tout cela n'est pas juste, assurément. Il est possible qu'ils deviennent clairvoyants, mais les moyens employés sont répréhensibles et les résultats aussi transitoires que les effets obtenus en fixant une boule de cristal, par l'usage de drogues et autres méthodes similaires.

Nous devons être conscients que notre corps physique est notre instrument le plus précieux, et qu'il est de notre devoir d'en prendre soin, raisonnablement, en veillant à sa santé et à son bien-être. Aucun pouvoir obtenu par les mauvais traitements infligés à notre corps n'a de valeur, et par conséquent ils ne sont ni désirables ni complètement efficaces.

Mais d'autres personnes entendent par ascétisme, "une vie propre et pure". Elles désirent le pouvoir spirituel sans sacrifier leurs tendances animales; elles désirent prendre leur essor à volonté vers les nuages, mais être libres, à d'autres moments, de se vautrer dans la fange, de continuer à se nourrir d'aliments grossiers, se gorger de viande et d'alcool, fumer, satisfaire leurs passions et leurs désirs sensuels, quels qu'ils soient; et en même temps elles espèrent acquérir des pouvoirs spirituels.

Cela ne peut se faire. Nos corps sont nos outils. Un bon ouvrier apprécie la valeur de bons outils et il les garde en parfaite condition, aiguisés et propres. Lorsque nos sens ont été émoussés par l'alcool et le tabac, que l'organisme est obligé de déployer toute son énergie pour digérer ou éliminer une nourriture grossière, peut-on s'attendre à devenir "un sensitif"? On ne peut servir Dieu et Mammon. Si nous désirons des pouvoirs spirituels, nous devons payer le prix de vies propres, donner à notre corps une nourriture pure et nous conformer aux règles d'une vie simple; nous devons nous abstenir de tout ce qui émousse les sens: alcool, tabac et abus similaires. Si c'est là ce qu'on appelle une "vie d'ascétisme", alors l'ascétisme est absolument nécessaire.

### <h3 id="question-139">Question 139</h3>

Les enfants sont-ils tous clairvoyants jusqu'à un certain âge?

RÉPONSE - Oui, ils le sont tous, du moins pendant la première année de leur vie. Le laps de temps durant lequel l'enfant détient cette faculté dépend en grande partie de sa spiritualité et aussi de son milieu, car la plupart des enfants font part de tout ce qu'ils voient à leurs aînés, et leur faculté de clairvoyance est affectée par l'attitude de ces derniers qui, trop souvent, se moquent d'eux, ce qui blesse profondément leur nature sensible. Ils apprennent bientôt à exclure les scènes qui leur attirent la moquerie de leurs aînés, ou du moins ils apprendront à garder de telles expériences pour eux. Lorsqu'on prend la peine de les écouter, ils nous révèlent souvent des choses merveilleuses; il est quelquefois possible de remonter à une vie antérieure, grâce aux informations d'un petit enfant. Cela se produit, habituellement, si l'enfant est mort très jeune dans sa précédente vie, car en ce cas, n'étant resté dans le Monde Invisible que pendant une période d'un an à vingt ans, il est possible de vérifier ses dires. Les enfants qui, dans leur vie précédente, sont morts dans l'enfance, sont beaucoup plus aptes à se rappeler le passé et à être clairvoyants que les autres enfants, car leur corps du désir et leur corps vital ne naissent pas en même temps que leur corps physique, mais à sept ans pour le corps vital, et à quatorze ans pour le corps du désir, et ce qui n'a pas été vivifié ne peut mourir; ainsi, lorsqu'un enfant meurt avant la naissance du corps vital ou du corps du désir, il ne va ni au Deuxième ni au Troisième Ciel, mais il reste dans le Monde du Désir, et renaîtra avec le même corps du désir et le même intellect qu'il possédait dans sa précédente vie. C'est la raison pour laquelle il est apte à se rappeler ce qui lui est arrivé alors. Il y a quelques années, l'auteur a eu connaissance d'un cas de ce genre dans la Californie du Sud.

Un certain M. Roberts se promenait un jour à Santa Barbara dans une rue de cette ville, lorsqu'une petite fille accourut vers lui et lui entoura les genoux de ses bras en l'appelant "Papa". M. Roberts pensa que quelqu'un voulait lui imposer cet enfant, et il se dégagea indigné. La mère de la petite fille, non moins décontenancée du geste de l'enfant, l'emmena malgré ses cris. "Mais c'est mon papa, c'est mon papa", répétait-elle. En raison de circonstances qui seront relatées plus loin, M. Roberts ne pouvait ôter cet incident de sa mémoire et il alla trouver un clairvoyant que nous appellerons "X". S'étant rendu avec lui chez les parents de la petite fille, il leur fut permis de la questionner. Aussitôt que l'enfant eut aperçu M. Roberts, elle s'élança vers lui en l'appelant "papa". Répondant alors aux questions qui lui furent posées, par intervalles, durant l'après-midi, la petite fille raconta l'histoire que nous donnerons en observant l'ordre des faits.

"Il y a longtemps, elle demeurait avec M. Roberts qui était son papa, et avec une autre maman, dans une petite maison bâtie près d'un ruisseau où poussaient certaines fleurs (ici, elle sortit de la maison et revint avec des chatons de saule). Au-dessus du ruisseau il y avait une planche qu'il lui était défendu de traverser, de peur qu'elle ne tombât dans l'eau. Un jour, M. Roberts les quitta toutes deux, sa mère et elle, et ne revint jamais plus. Quelque temps après, sa maman, qui s'était couchée, ne bougea plus. "Elle devint très tranquille et elle est morte". Alors, ajouta l'enfant, "je suis aussi morte, mais pas vraiment; je suis venue ici".

M. Roberts, à son tour, raconta son histoire. "Il y avait environ dix-huit ans de cela, il vivait en Angleterre avec son père qui était brasseur. Il s'était épris de leur jeune servante, mais le père refuse son consentement au mariage. Les deux jeunes gens s'enfuirent jusqu'à Londres où ils se marièrent et, de là, ils s'embarquèrent pour l'Australie où M. Roberts aménagea une petite ferme dans la brousse, et se bâtit une maisonnette près d'un ruisseau bordé de saules. Il y avait une passerelle pour passer d'un côté du ruisseau à l'autre. Un enfant naquit. Cette enfant pouvait avoir deux ans lorsque M. Roberts s'en alla un jour à environ deux kilomètres de la maisonnette pour défricher un bout de terrain. Pendant qu'il était occupé à cela, un agent de police s'approcha de lui, l'arme au poing, et l'arrêta pour un vol commis dans une banque, le jour même où il avait quitté Londres.

Il eut beau protester de son innocence, supplier qu'on lui permît d'aller s'occuper de sa femme et de son enfant pour assurer leur existence, le policier fut inflexible, craignant un piège qui l'aurait fait tomber entre les mains de ses complices, il chassa vers la côte, à la pointe de son pistolet, le malheureux Mr. Roberts qui fut emmené en Angleterre. Traduit en justice pour vol, il fut finalement déclaré non coupable. Jusqu'alors les autorités n'avaient prêté aucune attention à ses plaintes déchirantes concernant sa femme et sa petite fille, qui devaient être mortes de faim dans la brousse australienne.On envoya un télégramme, un détachement partit en reconnaissance et la réponse arriva. Ils avaient découvert les cadavres des deux abandonnées. M. Roberts, le coeur brisé, partit pour l'Amérique".

On montra à l'enfant des photographies mêlées avec celles de M. Roberts et de sa femme. M. Roberts avait beaucoup changé depuis que sa photographie avait été prise. Néanmoins, l'enfant, lorsqu'elle la vit, s'écria joyeusement: "voilà papa!" Elle reconnut aussi la photographie de celle qui avait été sa mère dans sa précédente existence. La petite fille n'avait que trois ans environ lorsque M. Roberts l'avait retrouvée et elle n'aurait certainement pas pu inventer une telle histoire. Plus tard, un des grands journaux de la Californie, le "Los Angeles Times", fit une enquête sur ce cas et les faits furent confirmés, tels que nous les avons rapportés ici.

### <h3 id="question-140">Question 140</h3>

Quelle est la différence entre la magie blanche et la magie noire, et quel effet la pratique de la magie noire a-elle sur l'âme?

RÉPONSE - La magie est un procédé par lequel nous pouvons obtenir certains résultats impossibles à atteindre au moyen des lois ordinairement connues. Certaines personnes ont étudié des lois de la nature inconnues de la plupart des humains et sont devenus experts dans la manipulation de forces plus subtiles. Ils utilisent leur pouvoir pour venir en aide à leurs semblables, là où cela peut se faire en harmonie avec les lois de leur croissance spirituelle. D'autres, ayant étudié ces mêmes lois et étant devenus capables de manipuler les forces cachées de l'univers, utilisent leur science à des fins égoïstes, pour obtenir un pouvoir sur autrui. Les premiers sont des magiciens blancs, les autres des magiciens noirs. Tous mettent en oeuvre les mêmes forces, la différence étant le motif qui les fait agir. Le magicien blanc est inspiré à la fois par l'amour et par la bienveillance. Bien qu'il ne soit guidé par aucune idée de récompense, une croissance de l'âme merveilleuse à contempler résulte du bon usage de la magie. Le placement de ses talents lui rapporte un intérêt de cent pour cent. Le magicien noir, lui, est dans une triste situation, car il est dit que "l'âme qui a péché mourra", et tout ce que nous faisons en désaccord avec les lois de Dieu amène inévitablement la détérioration des qualités de l'âme.

Il se peut que le magicien noir puisse, grâce à ses connaissance et à son art, maintenir sa position dans l'évolution pendant plusieurs vies, mais finalement arrive le moment où son âme se désintègre et où l'Ego retourne à ce que nous pourrions appeler l'état sauvage.

La magie noire, dans ses formes mineures, telles que l'hypnotisme, par exemple, cause parfois l'idiotie congénitale dans une vie ultérieure. L'hypnotiseur prive ses victimes du libre usage de leur corps. De par la loi de conséquence, il est alors lié à un corps dont le cerveau mal conformé l'empêche de s'exprimer. Il ne faut pas en déduire, cependant, que tous les cas d'idiotie congénitale sont dus à des pratiques illicites de la part de l'Ego dans une vie passée; il y a aussi d'autres causes susceptibles de provoquer cette infirmité.

### <h3 id="question-141">Question 141</h3>

Vous parlez des écoles d'occultisme orientale et occidentale. L'école occidentale n'est-elle pas la meilleure et si oui, pourquoi?

RÉPONSE - Il y a actuellement sur terre plusieurs races différentes. Les Hindous sont la première race de l'Epoque Aryenne actuelle, et les Anglo- Saxons sont la cinquième . L'enseignement le plus récent est naturellement donné à la race la plus avancée. Par conséquent, la religion occidentale, le Christianisme, est bien supérieure à l'Hindouisme et au Bouddhisme. Les enseignements des Mystères de l'Orient ne sont pas aussi avancés que ceux de l'Occident. En Orient on s'attache particulièrement à dompter le corps pour développer les facultés spirituelles. Plaçant le corps dans des positions spéciales, ils effectuent simultanément des exercices respiratoires pénibles et d'autres exercices physiques qui ne sont pas nécessaires dans la méthode occidentale. En fait ces méthodes sont préjudiciables au corps occidental. De plus, l'étudiant, en Orient, est sous l'autorité absolue de son instructeur, qu'il appelle "Maître", et aux ordres duquel il doit obéir jusque dans les moindres détails, sans poser de question. En Occident nous suivons les enseignements du Christ, Qui disait à Ses disciples, "Désormais, je vous appelle amis, car le serviteur ne sait pas ce que fait son maître, alors que je vous ai fait connaître tout ce que j'ai appris de mon Père." (Jean 15:15). C'est pourquoi en Occident l'instructeur est dans les termes de la plus haute amitié avec son élève, et il est toujours prêt à répondre à ses questions, tant qu'elles sont compatibles avec son degré de développement.

Il y a, bien entendu, quelques Orientaux qui sont très avancés dans les enseignements de leur école, mais on atteint généralement un degré correspondant par la méthode occidentale dans un temps plus court et avec moins d'efforts.

### <h3 id="question-142">Question 142</h3>

Quelle différence y a-t-il entre la vue éthérique, la clairvoyance et la vue appartenant au Monde de la Pensée?

RÉPONSE - Lorsqu'une personne douée de la vue éthérique regarde un homme, elle voit d'abord ses vêtements extérieurs, ensuite leur doublure, puis les sous- vêtements, la peau, les côtes frontales, les différents organes du corps qui se trouvent dans le champ de sa vision; puis la colonne vertébrale, les côtes dorsales, la chair, la peau et le dos des vêtements. En d'autres termes, elle voit à travers lui. La vue éthérique permet de voir à travers les livres, les papiers, les murs, ou tout ce qui se trouve placé à une courte distance. En fait, cette faculté peut être appelée «vue rayons X». Une seule substance est impénétrable à la vision éthérique: le verre, qui lui est aussi opaque qu'un mur de pierre l'est à la vue physique ordinaire, probablement pour la même raison qui fait que cette substance est un puissant isolant pour l'électricité. 

Lorsqu'un clairvoyant regarde une personne, il voit son corps du désir ainsi que les contreparties intérieure et extérieure - chaque particule en même temps - de ses autres véhicules subtils. Il est plutôt difficile de lire un livre ou même une lettre avec la vue éthérique, parce qu'il faut regarder à travers d'autres pages qui brouillent celle que l'on désire lire. Mais au clairvoyant ordinaire il semble que le livre ou la lettre sont ouverts, de sorte qu'il peut lire n'importe quel passage ou page sans avoir à regarder à travers une autre partie du livre. Mais lorsqu'on regarde un objet en se servant de la vue appartenant aux quatre régions inférieures du Monde de la Pensée, et l'auteur n'a pas une connaissance personnelle des régions plus élevées, on trouve, au lieu de formes, des espaces vides ou des moules, qui nous parlent et nous donnent des détails sur eux-mêmes. La nécessité de faire des investigations est éliminée de ce monde. Là nous savons sur-le-champ tout ce qui concerne l'objet sur lequel se porte notre attention. Il y a cependant un curieux inconvénient à la connaissance acquise de cette manière; elle apparaît toute entière à la fois. La somme de cette connaissance est un tout, et n'a ni commencement ni fin. Aussi est-ce une tâche herculéenne que de la développer en un concept ordonné, séquentiel, compréhensible aux autres, et à nous-mêmes.

### <h3 id="question-143">Question 143</h3>

Est-il bon pour une personne très faible nerveusement de suivre l'entraînement occulte donné par les Rosicruciens, ou est-il nécessaire que cette personne recouvre d'abord la santé? Peut-on recouvrer la santé grâce à un entraînement occulte?

RÉPONSE - Les seuls exercices donnés publiquement par les Rosicruciens sont celui du soir et celui du matin. L'exercice du soir consiste en une rétrospection des évènements de la journée, en sens inverse. Durant cette revue rétrospective l'aspirant s'efforce de cultiver un sentiment de la plus sincère contrition pour tout ce qu'il peut avoir fait de mal, et aussi de se sentir intensément heureux lorsqu'il a été capable d'améliorer sa conduite, dans une action du jour écoulé. L'exercice du matin consiste en une concentration sur un idéal élevé, le Christ, par exemple.

Si une personne d'un tempérament nerveux s'efforce de faire calmement et tranquillement ces exercices, elle en ressentira un effet bénéfique, surtout si elle tâche de relâcher chaque muscle de son corps pendant ces exercices.

L'attitude d'un chat, guettant le trou d'une souris fournit une excellente illustration de la détente. Il est assis dans une position parfaitement aisée; calmement, tranquillement il attend que la souris apparaisse. Aucune énergie n'est dissipée en inquiétude ou en anxiété. Il persiste tranquillement, ayant foi que tôt ou tard, l'occasion se présentera. Toute sa force est réservée pour le moment suprême où il bondira pour saisir sa proie. Si l'élève détend complètement ses muscles, passe en revue calmement et tranquillement les évènements de la journée durant l'exercice du soir, et se concentre sur un idéal élevé pendant l'exercice du matin, sa nervosité disparaîtra graduellement, et un jour, l'occasion se présentera: sa vision spirituelle s'épanouira.

### <h3 id="question-144">Question 144</h3>

Un corps sain étant nécessaire à l'épanouissement spirituel, que peuvent offrir les enseignements Rosicruciens à celui dont la condition physique laisse à désirer? Une santé parfaite sera-t-elle un résultat de l'étude de cette philosophie, et si l'enseignement est mis en pratique tend-il à garder une personne en bonne santé?

RÉPONSE - L'auteur de la question se méprend lorsqu'il dit qu'un corps sain est nécessaire au vrai épanouissement spirituel; et probablement, il oublie aussi la différence entre "sain" et "sensible". Bien des gens peu développés spirituellement ont un corps physique des plus sains et en excellente santé, mais ne sont nullement sensibles aux vibrations spirituelles. En voici un exemple concret; l'auteur a eu, pendant de longues années, un réveille-matin très bon marché. Bien souvent, il a été mis dans des bagages que transportaient sans aucun soin des porteurs ou des commissionnaires. Or ce réveil, malgré les secousses et les mauvais traitements, a continué à marcher et à marquer l'heure, mais avec quelques minutes d'avance ou de retard. Il était solide mais non exact.

D'autre part, le chronomètre dont on se sert à bord des navires est extrêmement délicat. Il repose sur un cardan qui garde toujours la position horizontale et compense le plus léger mouvement du bateau, en sorte que le chronomètre marque toujours l'heure la plus juste. Des milliers de vies dépendent, en effet, de la précision de l'instrument. Un capitaine lancé sur l'océan, sans route tracée, sait exactement, grâce à ce chronomètre, à quelle distance, ouest ou est, il se trouve de Greenwich. Il a la mesure exacte de la position du navire, une mesure sur laquelle reposent les vies de tous les passagers et les millions de dollars que valent les biens confiés à ses soins. Une comparaison entre le chronomètre sensible et le réveil grossier montre la différence qui existe entre un être "sensible" et un être "sain".

Lorsque nous étudions les hautes philosophies, que nous vivons la vie qu'elles enseignent, notre corps devient extrêmement sensible et il doit recevoir plus de soins que celui d'un Amérindien ou d'un Noir des déserts d'Afrique, qui n'ont pas le système nerveux délicatement organisé de la race blanche. Ceux qui suivent la voie du développement spirituel sont particulièrement sensitifs, c'est pourquoi, plus on progresse, plus on doit prendre soin de cet instrument. Mais nous apprenons aussi les lois qui le régissent, et comment nous y conformer. Si nous mettons en pratique nos connaissances, il nous sera possible d'avoir un instrument sensible et de le garder en relativement bon état.

Il est des cas, cependant, où une maladie est nécessaire pour apporter au corps certains changements, précurseurs d'un plus haut degré d'épanouissement spirituel. Dans ces conditions, bien entendu, la maladie est une bénédiction et non une malédiction. D'une manière générale, on peut dire que l'étude de la haute philosophie tendra toujours à améliorer la santé, car "savoir c'est pouvoir", et plus nos connaissances sont nombreuses, plus nous sommes capables de nous mesurer avec toutes les circonstances qui se présentent, pourvu, bien entendu, que nous mettions notre savoir en pratique, que nous vivions la vie, que nous ne nous bornions pas à écouter, mais que nous agissions, car un enseignement ne nous sert à rien si nous ne l'incorporons pas à notre vie et ne le vivons pas jour après jour.

### <h3 id="question-145">Question 145</h3>

De quelle manière la clairvoyance nous aidera-t-elle après la mort, si nous l'avons cultivée dans cette vie?

RÉPONSE - De plusieurs manières. D'abord, bien des gens ont une grande crainte de la mort: le seul mot de mort leur donne des frissons, et ils évitent d'en parler. La crainte de la mort produit des formes-pensées de nature hideuse, et lorsqu'une personne quitte son corps à la mort, pour entrer dans le Monde Invisible, elle voit ces formes horribles l'entourer comme autant de démons qui la rendent presque folle. Ce sont là pourtant les créatures de son imagination, et elle ne pourra s'en débarrasser avant d'avoir appris qu'elles n'ont aucun pouvoir sur elle, et qu'elle leur aura commandé hardiment de disparaître. Elles s'évanouiront alors, comme la rosée sous les rayons du soleil.

Il arrive parfois qu'une personne ayant cultivé la clairvoyance pendant sa vie terrestre soit tourmentée, elle aussi, à sa première entrée dans le Monde Invisible, par diverses entités élémentales qui prennent les formes les plus hideuses. Reconnaissant dans le néophyte un futur maître possible, elles cherchent à l'intimider et à le détourner de ses desseins, mais, comme il est généralement aidé par un instructeur qui lui enseigne que ces entités n'ont aucun pouvoir sur lui, il domine bientôt sa crainte. Lorsqu'à la mort il quitte son corps et entre dans le Monde Invisible, il est déjà familiarisé avec la plupart des spectacles et des scènes de ce monde; et surtout aucune crainte ne l'entrave plus.

### <h3 id="question-146">Question 146</h3>

La contemplation du Dieu intérieur, effectuée d'une façon persistante, aide-t-elle à la croissance spirituelle et mène-t-elle à l'état d'adepte?

RÉPONSE - Nous vivons dans le monde prosaïque de l'Occident, où il est de notre devoir d'accomplir notre tâche quotidienne, quelle qu'elle soit. Chacun de nous a un travail à faire. Si nous nous y dérobons pour nous livrer à une introspection morbide, non seulement nous ne croîtrons pas spirituellement, mais nous dégénérerons.

Quelques personnes, malheureusement, se croient autorisées à laisser leurs devoirs terrestres lorsqu'elles s'imaginent qu'un avancement spirituel les sollicite, mais avant que nous ayons accompli chacun de nos devoirs ici-bas, il ne peut y avoir aucun avancement spirituel véritable; tout ce qui pourrait y ressembler sera finalement réduit à néant.

Les pays d'Extrême-Orient illustrent, par un exemple affreux, les mauvais résultats que donne la négligence des devoirs matériels pour la poursuite fallacieuse de ce que l'on imagine être des pouvoirs spirituels. Là, les gens émacient et déforment leur corps par des pratiques telles que celle qui consiste à tenir son bras levé au-dessus de la tête jusqu'à ce qu'il se dessèche. Il n'y a de vraie spiritualité que celle qui aide le monde entier. Ce qui ne tend pas à élever l'humanité tout entière n'élèvera jamais personne. Un désir ardent et profond d'aider au bien commun est la seule chose qui puisse justifier un surcroît d'efforts apportés à la culture des pouvoirs spirituels. Que penser d'une mère qui fréquenterait les réunions où l'on discute la question des meilleurs soins à donner aux enfants, alors que les siens sont laissés à l'abandon dans une maison en désordre? De telles histoires ne sont pas de simples plaisanteries; elles contiennent une plus grande part de vérité que d'invraisemblance. Et ceux qui discourent sur la spiritualité, désirant contempler l'ange intérieur, et qui négligent leur famille et leurs devoirs immédiats ont des points communs avec de telles mères. Plus tôt nous nous éveillerons à la compréhension du fait qu'aucun devoir présent, si humble soit-il, ne peut être négligé avec impunité pour un travail spirituel, même exaltant, mieux cela vaudra pour nous et mieux s'en trouveront ceux qui nous entourent. Nous conseillons à notre correspondant de lire le poème de Longfellow, "La Belle Légende" ("Enseignement d'un Initié", chapitre 3). Il est très adapté à la situation: Un moine en prière est agenouillé sur le carreau de sa cellule lorsqu'une adorable vision du Christ paraît devant ses yeux, cela juste au moment où la cloche de midi l'appelle à la porte où les pauvres attendent les aumônes qui leur sont distribuées chaque jour à cette heure. Une question vient alors à l'esprit du moine: dois-je rester pour m'entretenir avec mon Visiteur Béni? ou faut-il que je Le quitte pour quelques mendiants affamés? Une voix intérieure lui dit:

```
"Fais ton devoir, cela vaut mieux. 
Pour le reste, remets-t'en à Dieu."
```

Il suit le conseil de cette voix, laissant la Vision dans la cellule en se demandant si elle sera encore là à son retour. Il sent pourtant qu'il a raison de faire son devoir vis-à-vis d'autrui, sans tenir compte d'une perte éventuelle pour lui, et lorsqu'après avoir distribué les aumônes aux pauvres il retourne à sa cellule, la Vision l'accueille par ces mots, "Serais-tu resté, j'aurais dû partir".

### <h3 id="question-147">Question 147</h3>

Ne dit-on pas que certaines personnes ont développé le pouvoir spirituel, appelé clairvoyance, sixième sens, ou tel autre nom qu'on veut bien lui donner, en vivant une vie pure, en harmonie avec les lois de la nature? Les enseignements des occultistes modernes, avec leurs nombreux termes techniques, n'ont-ils pas tendance à créer de la confusion plutôt que d'apporter le résultat désiré?

RÉPONSE - Le sentier du développement dépend dans tous les cas du tempérament de l'aspirant. Il y a deux sentiers, le sentier mystique et le sentier intellectuel; le mystique est habituellement dépourvu de connaissances intellectuelles; il suit les commandements de son coeur et s'efforce de faire la volonté de Dieu, telle qu'il la sent, s'élevant sans avoir conscience d'aucun but défini, et pour finir il atteint la connaissance. Au Moyen Age, les gens n'étaient pas aussi intellectuels qu'ils le sont aujourd'hui, et ceux qui sentaient l'appel de la vie supérieure suivaient généralement le sentier mystique. Mais dans les siècles derniers, depuis l'avènement de la science moderne, une humanité plus intellectuelle a peuplé la terre; la tête a complètement dominé le coeur, le matérialisme l'a emporté sur toute impulsion spirituelle, et la majorité des gens ne croient qu'à ce qu'ils peuvent toucher, goûter ou manier. Il est donc nécessaire de faire appel à leur intelligence, afin que leur coeur soit amené à croire ce que l'intelligence a sanctionné. Pour répondre à cette demande, des systèmes modernes d'occultisme tendent à établir une corrélation entre les faits scientifiques et les vérités spirituelles. L'attitude d'esprit matérialiste est, naturellement, adoptée plus particulièrement en Occident, et l'Ordre Rosicrucien fut fondé au 13e siècle pour préparer un antidote contre le poison du matérialisme, qui puisse être administré en doses correspondant aux exigences du moment. Paracelse, Coménius, van Helmont, Bacon et d'autres ont donné, d'une manière plus voilée, les enseignements qui sont maintenant publiquement diffusés pour démontrer que la science, l'art et la religion sont la trinité d'une même unité, qui ne peuvent être séparés sans fausser notre vue.

La vraie religion englobe à la fois la science et l'art, car elle enseigne une vie belle en harmonie avec les lois de la nature.

La vraie science est artistique et religieuse au sens le plus élevé, car elle nous enseigne à révérer les lois qui gouvernent notre bien-être et à nous y conformer, et elle explique pourquoi la vie religieuse est favorable à la santé et à la beauté.

L'art vrai est aussi éducatif que la science, et nous élève, par son influence, comme le fait la religion. Dans l'architecture nous avons une présentation des plus sublimes des lignes de forces cosmiques dans l'univers. Elle remplit le contemplateur spirituel d'une dévotion puissante et d'une adoration nées de la conception pleine de respect qu'il se fait de la grandeur et de la majesté incommensurables de la Divinité. La sculpture et la peinture, la musique et la littérature nous inspirent un sentiment de la beauté transcendante de Dieu, source et but immuable de ce monde admirable.

Rien de moins qu'un enseignement qui embrasse tous ces sujets ne saurait répondre aux besoins d'une large catégorie d'humains dont le nombre va croissant, et c'est pourquoi une religion à la fois technique et dévotionnelle est absolument nécessaire à notre époque.

### <h3 id="question-148">Question 148</h3>

Est-il possible de développer la clairvoyance en usant de drogues, en fixant une boule de cristal ou par des exercices respiratoires, et ces méthodes n'amènent-elles pas des résultats plus rapides que celles que vous recommandez?

RÉPONSE - Oui, il est possible de cultiver une certaine sorte de clairvoyance par l'une des méthodes mentionnées ci-dessus; mais, lorsqu'un homme cultive le sixième sens par de tels moyens, il n'est pas maître de cette faculté; le pouvoir de produire la clairvoyance réside dans le cristal, non dans l'homme. Celui-ci se trouve dans la situation de celui qui apprend l'équitation dans un manège où tous les chevaux sont entraînés à se laisser monter. Les élèves n'acquièrent pas la capacité de monter des animaux intraitables, mais ils montent simplement à cheval avec le consentement de leur monture.

Si un homme apprend à maîtriser un cheval non dressé, il peut en maîtriser d'autres, et les monter en vertu du pouvoir qu'il a de maîtriser son cheval. De même, lorsqu'un homme a utilisé son pouvoir de volonté, au lieu de drogues ou d'une boule de cristal, pour maîtriser son corps et cultiver la clairvoyance, il a acquis une qualité d'âme qui le rend capable d'exercer sa faculté dans toutes ses existences futures également. Mais, celui qui fixe une boule de cristal ou qui s'adonne à la drogue perd à la mort la faculté ainsi acquise, et doit attendre d'avoir entraîné son corps nouveau, dans une existence ultérieure, en se servant à nouveau de drogues ou de boules de cristal; il résulte donc de ces méthodes une grande perte de temps et d'efforts. Si nous tenons compte du fait que les drogues et les exercices respiratoires ont un effet terriblement destructeur sur le corps physique, on peut en conclure que ces méthodes sont tout à fait indésirables. Bien des gens sont aujourd'hui dans des asiles d'aliénés ou morts de tuberculose pulmonaire par suite d'exercices respiratoires; quant aux effets des drogues, ils sont bien connus.

De plus, il y a différentes sortes de clairvoyants. Il y en a qui ont une faculté telle, que le clairvoyant peut être comparé à un prisonnier assis dans sa cellule derrière les barreaux. De là, il voit un certain paysage; il ne peut échapper à ce qui vient dans son champ visuel, car il ne peut détourner les yeux. Devant sa fenêtre se trouvent aussi des volets qu'il ne peut pas manoeuvrer. Ainsi, tant que ces volets sont ouverts, il est obligé de voir ce qui se passe de l'autre côté de la fenêtre, que le spectacle lui plaise ou non. Une faculté de cette nature est souvent une vraie malédiction, car les scènes les plus horribles passent quelquefois devant les yeux de tels clairvoyants. L'auteur se rappelle le cas d'un certain conférencier qui possédait cette sorte de clairvoyance. Un jour où il faisait une conférence, pendant la guerre des Philippines, une horrible scène de bataille se présenta devant ses yeux. Une rencontre avait lieu à ce moment même entre les Philippins et les Américains; il voyait des chevaux éventrés, des Américains taillés en pièces par les bolos des indigènes. Dans l'impossibilité d'écarter cette vision, il devint d'une pâleur mortelle, mais, par le pouvoir de sa volonté il vint à bout de sa conférence sans attirer l'attention de ses auditeurs sur son propre désarroi.

Il y a d'autres clairvoyants qui n'ont qu'une maîtrise partielle de leur faculté et qui ne peuvent compter sur ce pouvoir en tout temps. C'est à cette classe qu'appartient le médium ordinaire qui prostitue sa clairvoyance pour de l'argent. De temps à autre, lorsque le courant passe, le médium peut donner d'excellents renseignements et dire la vérité, mais à d'autres moments, lorsque le courant ne passe pas, il peut être tenté d'assurer son gagne-pain et ses frais courants en simulant. 

Le seul moyen sûr de cultiver la faculté de clairvoyance est de faire les exercices enseignés dans les Ecoles des Mystères, mais ces exercices et leçons destinés au développement des facultés supérieures ne sont jamais vendus à prix d'or ou pour des considérations matérielles. Ils sont toujours donnés en récompense au mérite. Celui qui possède la faculté de clairvoyance positive, cultivée par cette méthode, ne connaît pas de jours de défaillance; cependant, il ne consentira jamais à employer cette faculté pour satisfaire la curiosité, pour des expériences, ou autre but frivole. Il oriente toute son énergie pour aider à élever l'humanité.

### <h3 id="question-149">Question 149</h3>

Quel est le meilleur moment de la matinée pour la concentration?

RÉPONSE - Le but des exercices, aussi bien celui du matin que celui du soir, est d'amener l'élève en contact conscient avec les mondes invisibles, et il n'y a pas de meilleur moment pour cela que le réveil, car durant la nuit l'esprit se retire du corps dense pour entrer dans les mondes invisibles, laissant le corps physique endormi sur le lit; et c'est le retour de l'esprit, le matin, qui cause le réveil du corps et concentre la conscience sur le monde matériel au moyen des organes des sens. Dans sa magnifique "Ode à l'Immortalité" Wordsworth dit:

```
"La naissance n'est qu'un sommeil et qu'un oubli, 
Et l'Ame qui se lève avec nous, cette Etoile de notre vie, 
A eu son coucher ailleurs, et revient de loin, 
Non pas dans un oubli entier, ni une nudité complète, 
Mais portant des nuages de gloire; nous venons bien 
De Dieu qui est notre maison.

Le ciel est tout autour de nous dans notre enfance! 
Les ombres d'une prison commencent à se refermer 
Sur le Garçon qui grandit, 
Mais Il voit la lumière et d'où elle se déverse, 
Il la voit, dans sa joie. 

L'Adolescent qui, chaque jour s'éloignant de l'Est 
Doit voyager, est cependant encore 
Prêtre de la Nature, 
Et la vision splendide l'accompagne sur sa route. 
Avec le temps enfin, l'Homme la voit mourir, 
Et disparaître dans la lumière d'un jour ordinaire."
```

Comme le chante le poète, les Mondes Intérieurs sont le plus près de nous dans notre enfance, car c'est le matin de la vie, et il en est de même pour nous; lorsque nous nous éveillons le matin, nous sommes en contact plus étroit qu'à tout autre moment du jour avec les Mondes Spirituels, et il nous est alors très facile d'y retourner. C'est pourquoi l'élève doit commencer ses exercices au moment même où il s'éveille, sans laisser à son esprit le temps de se fixer sur autre chose. Relâchant complètement tous les muscles de son corps, il fixera son esprit sur un idéal élevé, ou sur les cinq premiers versets de l'Evangile de Jean, phrase après phrase ou dans leur ensemble. Cela le mettra en contact avec les vibrations cosmiques. Il doit laisser les sens en repos de façon à ne rien entendre, à ne rien voir dans sa chambre. Lorsqu'il y sera parvenu, les scènes du Monde du Désir se présenteront d'elles-mêmes à sa vision intérieure; d'abord par intermittence, ensuite de plus en plus clairement, car la pratique rend la vision parfaite.

Mais, pour la plupart l'exercice du soir est plus important et amènera probablement des résultats plus rapides, parce qu'il agit directement sur la vie que nous menons et nous ennoblit d'une manière que l'exercice du matin ne peut réussir.

### <h3 id="question-150">Question 150</h3>

Il m'est difficile de passer en revue les évènements du jour en ordre inverse au cours de l'exercice du soir. Est-ce absolument nécessaire et si oui, pourquoi?

RÉPONSE - Dans l'exercice du soir, l'étudiant revoit les évènements et juge sa vie au cours de ce jour-là. Il fait alors le travail qui est ordinairement réservé au Purgatoire et au Premier Ciel. Là, la vie est revécue en sens inverse, depuis les effets jusqu'aux causes, afin que nous puissions voir comment et pourquoi les souffrances résultent de nos erreurs. En passant en revue notre vie journalière en sens inverse, depuis les effets jusqu'aux causes, nous remarquons que la plupart de nos ennuis et de nos épreuves ont tous été causés par des actes passés datant du jour même, ou des jours précédents.

Il est de notre devoir de chercher cette cause et d'analyser la raison qui conduit à chaque développement, afin que nous puissions savoir, à l'avenir, comment tirer parti des occasions pour notre croissance de l'âme, et éviter le mal. Ainsi, en revivant l'expérience quotidienne en ordre inverse, nous profitons immédiatement des expériences faites, au lieu d'attendre que nous ayons quitté cette vie et soyons forcés de récolter au Purgatoire et au Premier Ciel le fruit de nos actions.

### <h3 id="question-151">Question 151</h3>

Quelle est la valeur des exercices respiratoires pour le développement du corps et de l'intellect?

RÉPONSE - La valeur des exercices respiratoires dépend des connaissances de la personne qui les donne. Les exercices respiratoires indiqués dans les livres et par de soi-disant maîtres, qui font de la réclame pour des cours de développement psychique, sont excessivement dangereux et de nombreuses personnes se trouvent aujourd'hui dans des asiles d'aliénés ou sont mortes de tuberculose pulmonaire pour les avoir pratiqués.

Chaque être humain est un individu et a besoin d'exercices individuels. Les exercices appropriés ne peuvent être donnés que par une personne qui est clairvoyante et qui est aussi capable de surveiller la croissance de certains organes éthériques dans le corps physique de l'étudiant. Elle doit aussi savoir ce que cette croissance doit être dans chaque cas. Toute personne qui a la capacité de donner ainsi cet exercice individuel sait aussi comment enrayer les développements indésirables. Mais un tel instructeur ne fait pas de réclame à tant la leçon pour un développement psychique. De tels exercices ne sont jamais vendus à prix d'argent, mais donnés en récompense au mérite.

La raison en est évidente: une personne qui exerce à volonté la faculté de clairvoyance possède un pouvoir énorme qui, s'il est mal utilisé, peut faire plus de mal qu'aucune arme terrestre. Il pourrait causer la panique sur les marchés mondiaux, amener la guerre et la discorde entre les nations, et le possesseur de ce pouvoir deviendrait ainsi un fléau pour la société, s'il aspirait à autre chose qu'au bien. Les puissances qui sont derrière l'évolution, les Frères Aînés de l'humanité qui ont développé ces pouvoirs et sont capables de les enseigner, prennent un soin extrême que nul n'y parvienne s'il n'a donné des preuves d'altruisme et s'il n'est lié par des voeux et des restrictions. C'est pourquoi nul ne devrait entreprendre des exercices respiratoires à moins qu'ils ne soient prescrits par un véritable instructeur, et il n'est pas nécessaire non plus de courir le monde à la recherche d'un tel instructeur. L'aspirant doit avant tout s'efforcer de faire le bien et d'utiliser les facultés qu'il possède dans le milieu où il se trouve, car c'est là le seul moyen d'arriver à un pouvoir plus élevé. Lorsqu'il s'y sera préparé suffisamment, l'instructeur apparaîtra dans sa vie, et l'aspirant n'aura aucun doute sur l'authenticité de l'enseignement qui lui sera alors donné. A ce sujet, nous citerons un petit poème qui est extrêmement beau:

```
"Ne perdez pas votre temps à soupirer 
Après des choses glorieuses, mais impossibles. 
N'attendez pas, dans une molle apathie, 
Qu'il vous pousse des ailes d'ange. 
Ne dédaignez pas d'être d'humbles chandelles, 
Car chacun ne peut être une étoile; 
Mais illuminez une partie de l'obscurité 
En brillant simplement là où vous êtes.

L'humble lumignon est nécessaire 
Aussi bien que le superbe Soleil. 
Et l'acte le plus humble est ennobli, 
Lorsqu'il est dignement accompli. 
Vous pouvez n'être jamais appelés 
A éclairer de lointaines régions obscures. 
Alors accomplissez votre mission jour après jour 
En brillant simplement là où vous êtes."
```

### <h3 id="question-152">Question 152</h3>

Le monde invisible dont vous parlez n'est-il pas irréel, chimérique, en comparaison du monde dans lequel nous vivons?

RÉPONSE - Dieu est la Réalité Première. Le Monde du Désir et le Monde de la Pensée sont d'un et de deux degrés plus près de cette source centrale d'énergie que le Monde Physique et, par conséquent, plus réels. On peut présumer que par le mot "réel" l'auteur de la question veut dire que, dans ce monde-ci, les formes sont stables et ne changent pas facilement, tandis que, dans les Mondes Invisibles, elles ont beaucoup plus de plasticité et changent avec la rapidité de la pensée; mais c'est la Vie qui est à l'intérieur de ces formes qui est la réalité, non la forme. La stabilité n'est pas la marque de la réalité. Tout ce qui, dans ce monde, est maintenant cristallisé et stable a d'abord existé dans une condition plastique, dans le Monde Invisible. Tout ce qui a été fait par la main de l'homme a d'abord été une forme-pensée dans l'intellect de son réalisateur.

Lorsqu'un architecte désire construire une maison, il y réfléchit d'abord. Il cherche à se former une idée aussi claire que possible de ce que doit être cette maison. Si les ouvriers pouvaient voir la forme-pensée dans l'intellect de l'architecte, ils seraient capables de travailler sans plans, mais comme l'idée de l'architecte est masquée par un voile de chair, il est nécessaire qu'il mette son idée sur le papier et fasse un plan. C'est la première phase de cristallisation; après quoi les maçons construisent la maison avec du fer, du bois et de la pierre.

D'après l'opinion générale, cette maison concrète est bien plus réelle que la forme-pensée dans l'intellect de l'architecte, mais en réalité il n'en est rien. La maison tangible peut être détruite en un instant par un tremblement de terre, par une explosion, ou de toute autre manière, tandis que l'idée qui est dans l'intellect de l'architecte durera tant que l'homme vivra, et l'on pourra construire une nouvelle maison ou une douzaine de maisons semblables d'après cette idée. Même après la mort de l'architecte, la maison existera encore dans l'éther à l'état de modèle, et tout clairvoyant capable d'entrer en contact avec les Mondes Invisibles et de lire dans la Mémoire de la Nature sera encore capable de l'y voir, à n'importe quel moment, bien que des millions d'années se soient écoulées. Ainsi, le Monde Invisible est la source et l'enregistrement durable de tout ce qui est, ou a été, ici-bas, il est donc la réalité primordiale.

<h2 id="section-7">Partie 7 - Questions Concernant l'Astrologie</h2>

### <h3 id="question-153">Question 153</h3>

Est-ce possible que l'astrologie et la chiromancie soient vraies au point que nous puissions détourner un danger futur si nous en avons été avertis par ces moyens? N'est-ce pas intervenir dans notre destinée?

RÉPONSE - La destinée que nous générons sous la loi de cause à effet par nos actions peut être divisée en trois sortes. Il y a d'abord la destinée qui, du fait de la nature du cas, ne peut être expiée dans la vie présente; par exemple, lorsqu'un homme commet un crime, qu'il soit ou non sanctionné ici-bas pour cette action, il est rare que la vie de prison adoucisse son caractère et le rende aimable. Parfois elle a l'effet contraire; elle l'aigrit et en fait un révolté. Avant que la Nature n'ait reçu réparation, il doit apprendre qu'il ne peut priver un être humain de sa forme; il doit apprendre à servir. Ainsi, le cas n'aura pas reçu réparation avant qu'il ait eu l'occasion, dans une existence ultérieure, de rendre un service important à sa victime.

Il y a une deuxième sorte de destinée que nous moissonnons au jour le jour; que nous payons comptant , pour ainsi dire. Si nous mangeons trop, nous avons une indigestion; si nous ne nous couvrons pas assez, nous prenons froid, etc.

La troisième sorte de destinée s'appelle la destinée "mûre". Elle résulte de nos actions dans des vies passées et elle a mûri en effets, de manière à être incorporée dans les images montrées a l'esprit, sous forme de panorama de sa prochaine vie, lorsqu'il se prépare à renaître. Lorsque l'esprit a choisi une certaine vie, avec la destinée "mûre" qui lui est allouée par les Anges de Justice pour être liquidée, il est lié par son choix. Les tendances à agir d'une manière qui contribue à ajuster la destinée mûre sont inhérentes au corps physique et inscrites dans les astres, car les influences stellaires sont la source de l'activité humaine, et c'est pourquoi cette destinée mûre peut être vue très clairement dans l'horoscope de naissance, et elle est manifeste pour l'astrologue et le chiromancien spirituels. L'astrologue peut aussi voir les autres sortes de destinée et parfois les confondre, ce qui fausse son point de vue quant à la possibilité d'éviter ou non les évènements. S'il s'agit de destinée" mûre", il est impossible d'éviter l'événement malgré tous les avertissements, ainsi que le montre l'exemple suivant:

En 1906, l'auteur enseignait l'astrologie à un certain M.L., conférencier bien connu de Los Angeles. Le thème astrologique de M.L. avait été choisi pour mieux lui permettre de vérifier l'exactitude des interprétations des différentes configurations se rapportant au passé, ce qui donnait plus d'intérêt à la leçon. L'horoscope révélait que M.L. avait eu plusieurs accidents à des dates faciles à vérifier. Un accident imminent était aussi indiqué, qui devait survenir au moment de la nouvelle lune, le 21 juillet 1906. M.L. fut donc averti de rester chez lui ce jour-là, ainsi que le septième jour après cette date, moment le plus dangereux. L'accident se rapportait à la partie inférieure de la tête, le cou, la poitrine, et les bras, et était consécutif à une sortie à bicyclette, en voiture ou en tram.

M.L., très impressionné, promit de rester chez lui aux dates indiquées. Dans l'intervalle, l'auteur fit un court voyage dans le nord et, de là, écrivit à M.L. pour lui rappeler le danger qu'il pouvait courir, et reçut une réponse l'assurant que M.L. serait prudent.

Quel ne fut pas son étonnement en apprenant, quelques jours plus tard, par un ami commun, que M.L. était allé faire une conférence à Sierra Madre, le 28 juillet, et qu'il avait été blessé aux endroits indiqués, dans une collision avec un tramway. Comment donc les conseils donnés avaient-ils pu être ainsi négligés? La réponse vint trois mois plus tard, sous forme d'une lettre de remerciements de M.L. pour les informations reçues, qu'il considérait comme précieuses puisqu'elles lui avaient prouvé la véracité de l'astrologie. La raison pour laquelle l'accident s'était produit quand même était qu'il avait confondu les dates, en prenant le 28 pour le 29.

Ce cas, de l'avis de l'auteur, montre qu'on ne peut intervenir dans la destinée mûre, et qu'il nous est possible de faire en toute sécurité tout ce que nous pouvons pour éviter un danger imminent, sans craindre du tout d'interférer avec la loi de conséquence. Il y a des agents invisibles tout autour de nous, prêts à contrecarrer chaque effort de notre part. Et ce sont ces agents qui, de l'avis de l'auteur, sont responsables de la confusion de dates de M.L.

### <h3 id="question-154">Question 154</h3>

Est-il mal d'employer la chiromancie, l'astrologie ou la phrénologie comme gagne-pain?

RÉPONSE - Ce qui est bien et ce qui est mal dépend du point de vue de l'individu. Il y a quelque cinquante ans, on pensait qu'il était licite de tuer un Noir rebelle. Son maître avait le droit de le faire comme il a aujourd'hui le droit de tuer un porc ou un cheval. A notre époque, il serait considéré comme meurtrier. De nos jours, certaines personnes regardent l'astrologie comme une simple question de calcul, la chiromancie et la phrénologie comme des sciences matérielles, sans signification spirituelle. Ceux qui envisagent ces sciences de cette manière ne sont pas répréhensibles s'ils les emploient comme gagne-pain, tandis que ceux qui connaissent le côté spirituel de ces sciences avilissent leur savoir en le vendant. D'ailleurs, quiconque rabaisse ainsi ces sciences spirituelles ne peut donner l'avis le meilleur et le plus élevé à ses clients, car l'appât de l'or obscurcira toujours son jugement. L'auteur a pu le constater, ainsi que tous ceux qui partagent cette manière de voir. En tout cas, notre correspondant aurait tort de faire de la connaissance qu'il a de ces sciences spirituelles un gagne- pain, car sa question montre qu'il a des doutes; et un jugement intérieur est déjà prononcé contre lui, s'il vend son savoir pour de l'argent.

Il y a une récompense qui a plus de valeur que l'or. Si nous employons notre savoir pour guérir et pour aider, nous ne manquerons jamais de moyens d'existence, et nous amasserons dans le Ciel des trésors que ni les vers ni la rouille ne peuvent corrompre. De plus grandes, de meilleures occasions de service seront nôtres si nous employons nos talents à servir en tout désintéressement.

### <h3 id="question-155">Question 155</h3>

Mars, Jupiter et les autres planètes sont-elles habitées? Si oui, les habitants de ces planètes sont-ils supérieurs aux Terriens? Les âmes de la Terre renaissent-elles sur d'autres planètes, et vice-versa?

RÉPONSE - Toutes les planètes du système solaire sont habitées, et servent de champs d'évolution à différentes classes d'esprits de degrés de développement différents. Les planètes les plus proches du Soleil portent les êtres les plus évolués. Jupiter est une exception à cette règle; il est habité par une humanité un peu plus élevée que celle de la Terre.

Le principe est le suivant: les vibrations les plus hautes existent dans le Soleil central, et il fut un temps où cet astre contenait tous les êtres vivant maintenant sur les différentes planètes. Mais ces êtres n'étaient pas tous capables de supporter les formidables vibrations de ce brouillard de feu central; alors une cristallisation se produisit aux pôles; graduellement la matière cristallisée gravita vers l'équateur et fut expulsée avec les esprits qui l'habitaient. Cette première émanation est devenue Uranus. Plus tard, d'autres classes d'esprits ont cristallisé une partie du Soleil et ont été expulsés à leur tour pour se mouvoir sur des orbites à des distances variant de la source centrale, suivant le taux de vibration nécessaire à l'épanouissement des esprits qui y demeuraient, formant finalement le système solaire tel que nous le connaissons aujourd'hui.

Chaque classe d'esprits reste dans son milieu, et se trouve sous la tutelle et la surveillance directes de l'un des Esprits Planétaires dont le corps est la planète qu'ils habitent. Comme les esprits ont été incarnés sur différentes planètes parce qu'ils sont à des degrés très différents d'épanouissement spirituel, ils ne s'incarnent généralement pas sur d'autres planètes, si ce n'est que, parfois, quelques esprits des planètes intérieures sont envoyés comme instructeurs sur les planètes extérieures. Tel fut le cas lorsque notre humanité eut besoin d'instructeurs incarnés et visibles. Alors quelques êtres de Vénus et de Mercure vinrent sur la Terre pour guider l'humanité naissante. Ils étaient connus comme les messagers des Dieux, et les Seigneurs de Vénus furent les premiers rois et gouverneurs de la race humaine. Plus tard, les plus avancés parmi les êtres humains furent confiés aux Seigneurs de Mercure qui les initièrent aux Mystères; et, à leur tour, ils gouvernèrent leurs frères. Ils furent alors vraiment rois par la grâce de Dieu, n'ayant en vue que l'élévation et le bien de leurs peuples, sans se soucier de pouvoir ou de prestige.

### <h3 id="question-156">Question 156</h3>

La théorie nébulaire ne fournit-elle pas une explication plus scientifique sur l'existence de l'univers que les histoires de la création dans la Bible?

RÉPONSE - La théorie nébulaire a été rejetée par Herbert Spencer parce que, comme la Bible, elle pose une Cause Première en postulat.

Résumée brièvement, voici en quoi consiste cette théorie: à un moment donné, un brouillard de feu apparut spontanément dans l'espace. A l'intérieur de ce brouillard de feu, des courants, spontanément également, se mirent en mouvement et, sous l'impact de ces courants, le brouillard de feu prit une forme sphérique, tournant sur elle-même avec une rapidité vertigineuse. La force centrifuge lui fit rejeter un anneau qui se désagrégea; les fragments fusionnèrent pour former une planète qui se mit à tourner sur une orbite autour de la masse centrale. C'est de cette manière que les différentes planètes furent amenées à l'existence l'une après l'autre. Elles se refroidirent graduellement et enfin le système solaire fut complet. Sur une de ces planètes au moins apparut spontanément la Vie, ou protoplasme, qui évolua graduellement en passant par les différentes classes de Radiaires, Mollusques, Articulés, Vertébrés, pour s'épanouir finalement en l'homme, qui est l'intelligence la plus élevée du Cosmos, seigneur de tout ce qui s'étend sous ses yeux.

C'est ainsi que s'exprime l'homme de science, d'un air entendu, et il ajoute: "Ne voyez-vous pas combien tout cela est simple et logique? Non? Alors, laissez-moi vous en faire la démonstration". Prenant une bassine, il la remplit d'eau sur laquelle il verse un peu d'huile. L'eau, dit-il, représente l'espace; l'huile, le brouillard de feu. Ensuite, avec une longue aiguille, notre démonstrateur commence à agiter l'huile, imitant ainsi les courants générés à l'intérieur du brouillard de feu, et sous l'action de ce mouvement rotatoire, l'huile prend une forme sphérique. Graduellement la sphère fait saillie à l'équateur, un anneau est expulsé, et prend la forme d'une planète qui se met à tourner autour de la sphère d'huile; et l'homme de science de s'écrier: "Voilà, ne voyez-vous pas comme cela est conforme à la nature, nul besoin de votre Dieu!"

On se demande comment des hommes dont l'intellect est capable de concevoir cette splendide démonstration peuvent, en même temps, être assez bornés pour ne pas se rendre compte qu'ils prennent eux-mêmes la place de Dieu qui a élaboré l'univers et l'a amené à l'existence comme l'homme de science a conçu sa démonstration et l'a mise à exécution. Dieu, par Son pouvoir préserve notre univers et fait mouvoir les planètes comme l'homme de science fait mouvoir sa planète d'huile, et si Dieu venait à cesser son activité pendant un seul instant, le cosmos se réduirait instantanément en un chaos congloméré, comme le Soleil et la planète d'huile cessent d'exister dès le moment où l'homme de science interrompt son opération.

Ainsi, loin de réfuter l'assertion de la Bible selon laquelle Dieu est le Créateur et la force agissante du Cosmos, la théorie nébulaire démontre à l'évidence la nécessité d'une intervention divine, et lorsqu'ils sont compris correctement, il n'y a pas de différence essentielle entre les concepts scientifique et religieux.

### <h3 id="question-157">Question 157</h3>

Qu'est-ce qu'une comète?

RÉPONSE - Considérant la sagesse des Grandes Hiérarchies Créatrices comparée à la nôtre, nous nous sentons naturellement enclins à penser qu'elles sont au- dessus de toute erreur; réflexion faite, il semble raisonnable que ces Hiérarchies fassent parfois des erreurs, étant donné qu'elles évoluent toujours, et bien qu'elles apprennent des leçons au-delà de notre portée. Elles sont actives dans le Macrocosme - "Grand Monde" ou Corps de Dieu - comme nous travaillons dans le Microcosme - "Petit Monde" - composé de nos différents véhicules, et de même que nous commettons des erreurs en traitant nos affaires et en apprenant les leçons que nous sommes en train d'apprendre, ainsi les Grandes Hiérarchies Créatrices échouent quelquefois dans leurs travaux.

Nous savons qu'en voulant donner naissance à un enfant, il peut y avoir un avortement. Le foetus est alors expulsé de l'organisme et commence à se corrompre. Le même risque existe lorsqu'un monde est en formation, c'est-à-dire qu'il se cristallise ou se fige avant d'avoir terminé la période de gestation dans le Monde du Désir. En ce cas, il n'a pas été modelé correctement, et on peut le comparer à du plâtre qu'un sculpteur aurait délayé pour en faire une belle statue, mais qui s'est durci en une masse informe et inutile avant d'être modelé. Lorsque cela se produit lors de la formation d'un monde, il en résulte ce qui est appelé une comète, et l'orbite elliptique qu'elle suit est la route d'un courant dans le Monde du Désir. Il y a du reste quelque chose de semblable dans la présence de l'Ego avant qu'il ne pénètre dans la matrice de la mère. Il affecte alors la forme d'une cloche ayant un noyau au sommet et une grande quantité de matière flottant derrière lui, semblable à la queue d'une comète. Et ces Egos en voie de renaissance, ayant la forme d'une cloche, décrivent aussi des orbites elliptiques autour de la terre jusqu'à ce que le temps soit venu pour eux d'entrer dans la matrice de leur future mère.

Le mouvement d'une planète à travers l'espace produit-il un bruit?

RÉPONSE - Pythagore, en parlant de l'harmonie des sphères, n'emploie pas cette expression comme une simple métaphore. Cette harmonie existe en réalité. Jean nous dit que "au commencement était le Verbe... et que rien de ce qui a été fait n'a été fait sans lui". C'est le "Fiat" créateur qui en premier fit naître le monde pour l'amener à l'existence. L'expérience familière consistant à mettre du sable sur un plateau de verre et à créer des figures géométriques en passant l'archet d'un violon sur ses bords, illustre la capacité créatrice du son. Et nous entendons parler de musique céleste, car du point de vue du Monde Céleste, toute chose est d'abord créée en termes de son qui, ensuite, modèle la matière concrète en la multitude de formes que nous voyons autour de nous.

Dans la sphère de vision de l'occultiste, le système solaire entier est un vaste instrument musical, désigné dans la mythologie grecque sous le nom de "lyre à sept cordes d'Apollon, le Dieu-Soleil radieux". De même que la gamme chromatique se compose de douze demi-tons et que nous avons sept touches blanches, soit sept tons entiers sur le clavier, de même, dans les cieux, nous avons les douze signes du zodiaque et les sept planètes: Et l'on peut dire que les signes du zodiaques sont la table d'harmonie de la harpe cosmique, et les sept planètes en sont les cordes; elles émettent des sons différents en passant devant les divers signes et, ce faisant, elles influencent l'humanité de diverses manières. Si l'harmonie faisait défaut un seul instant, s'il y avait la moindre discordance dans cette musique céleste, l'univers entier s'écroulerait, car la musique peut détruire aussi bien que construire. Cela a été prouvé par de grands musiciens. Le petit-fils de Mendelssohn a fait, pendant plusieurs années, de nombreuses expériences dans cette direction, qui étaient en rapport avec la puissance du son. Il est arrivé à la conclusion qu'une fois que l'on a trouvé la tonique d'un bâtiment, d'un pont, ou de tout autre structure, on peut raser celle-ci, en faisant résonner cette note suffisamment fort et longtemps. En voici l'illustration:

Il y a quelques années, un orchestre était occupé à répéter à proximité d'une vieille ruine de la région d'Heidelberg. A un certain endroit de la répétition, ils en vinrent à une note très haute et très prolongée, et lorsqu'elle retentit, la muraille de la ruine toute proche s'effondra dans un terrible fracas. Cette note était la tonique de la muraille et celle-ci s'était effondrée. En regard de ces faits, le dédaigneux sourire avec lequel nous avons écouté autrefois l'histoire de Josué et des murs de Jéricho n'est plus de mise. Très certainement les trompettes avaient retenti de la tonique de ces murs déjà rendus sensibles par la marche rythmique de l'armée, ce qui devait préparer le dénouement. La marche rythmique d'un grand nombre de piétons peut détruire un pont, et c'est pourquoi l'on commande aux soldats de rompre le pas lorsqu'ils en traversent un. Nous pouvons donc répondre ceci à la question posée: toute planète émet une certaine tonique qui est la somme totale de tous les bruits qui y résonnent, fondus, harmonisés par l'Esprit Planétaire intérieur. Ce son peut être entendu par l'oreille de l'esprit. Comme le dit Goethe dans le prologue de Faust:

```
"Le Soleil entonnant sa chanson de toujours, 
Parmi les chants rivaux des autres sphères, 
Se hâte sur le cours que lui prescrit la Loi, 
En grondant, à travers les ans, comme un tonnerre."
```

Et, dans la seconde partie, où les esprits des airs saluent le Soleil levant de ces mots:

```
"Et c'est le son qui, à l'oreille de l'esprit, Proclame que le jour naissant est là. 
Des craquements secouent les barrières de roche, 
Et les roues de Phébus roulent et chantent 
Le son intense apporté par la lumière!"
```

### <h3 id="question-159">Question 159</h3>

Quelle est la signification ésotérique de l'emploi des noms des douze fils de Jacob appliqués aux douze signes du zodiaque, et sont-ils employés en relation avec le zodiaque de la Terre, avec celui du Soleil ou avec tous les deux?

RÉPONSE - Il n'y a qu'un zodiaque, les douze constellations que nous appelons Bélier, Taureau, etc. Ce sont des astres, placés dans une bande étroite d'environ 8 degrés de chaque côté de l'écliptique, ou route du Soleil, telle que nous la voyons de la Terre. Les douze fils (compte tenu des Gémeaux) et l'unique fille de Jacob sont identifiés avec les douze constellations, parce que Flavius Josèphe précise que les Israélites errant dans le désert portaient les emblèmes de ces douze groupes d'étoiles sur leurs bannières. Au chapitre 49 de la Genèse et 33 du Deutéronome, des bénédictions sont données aux treize enfants de Jacob, de telle manière qu'il est impossible à une personne qui connaît l'astronomie de ne pas voir la ressemblance entre la description de ces enfants et les douze signes du zodiaque.

De même, si l'on considère la façon dont le camp des Israélites était dressé, les douze tribus groupées autour du tabernacle avec son chandelier à sept branches, un rapport s'établit à nouveau avec la disposition astronomique des douze signes du zodiaque localisés au-delà des sept planètes qui sont les lumières du système solaire, la Maison de Dieu.

La raison spirituelle de l'analogie entre Jacob, ses femmes, leurs enfants et le Cosmos peut être trouvée dans l'axiome hermétique, "Ce qui est en bas est comme ce qui est en haut". Jacob et ses quatre femmes symbolisent le Soleil et les quatre phases de la Lune, astres dispensateurs de vie à tout ce qui vit sur terre; les douze fils et la fille de Jacob symbolisent les Hiérarchies Créatrices qui ont été actives au cours de l'évolution de notre système solaire et qui ont amené, non seulement l'humanité, mais également tous les autres règnes de la nature, au présent degré de leur évolution; ces Hiérarchies travaillent, maintenant encore avec eux, afin de les développer encore en êtres spirituels. Ce sont elles qui ont fait l'homme à leur ressemblance. Même aujourd'hui l'humanité est empreinte des caractéristiques des douze signes célestes. C'est pourquoi, les Sémites originaux, qui devaient être les ancêtres d'une nouvelle race, ont été divisés en douze tribus par leur chef, chacune d'elles représentant une constellation.

### <h3 id="question-160">Question 160</h3>

Pouvez-vous donner une idée de la différence entre les astrologies héliocentrique et géocentrique? Cette dernière concerne-t-elle seulement les affaires de cette Terre, la vie matérielle, et la première, l'âme et le côté spirituel? Nous serions enclins à le croire, étant donné que le Soleil est l'astre spirituel, gouverneur de notre système solaire, et que nous nous servons du zodiaque du Soleil en astrologie héliocentrique, et de celui de la Terre en astrologie géocentrique. Des prédictions concernant la vie terrestre peuvent-elles aussi être faites d'après le zodiaque solaire, ou bien celui-ci a-t-il seulement trait au côté spirituel de la nature de la personne?

RÉPONSE - L'une des objections soulevées au sujet de l'ancien système d'astrologie est qu'on y considère la Terre comme le centre du système solaire, comme le firent les anciens. Or, depuis que Copernic nous a démontré que les planètes tournent autour du Soleil, un grand nombre de personnes considèrent l'astrologie comme une "science discréditée", comme une erreur évidente. Pour répondre à cette objection, certains astrologues modernes ont inventé ce qu'on appelle l'"astrologie héliocentrique" qui considère le Soleil comme le centre de notre système solaire, et les planètes comme se mouvant autour de cet astre.

Il est parfaitement vrai que, scientifiquement parlant, le système d'astrologie géocentrique, avec la Terre comme centre, est incorrect. Et qu'il est faux de dire que le Soleil est dans le Cancer, alors qu'en réalité c'est la Terre qui, voyageant sur son orbite, est arrivée dans le signe du Capricorne, ce qui fait que, pour nous sur Terre, le Soleil paraît être dans le Cancer. Mais là n'est pas le point essentiel; il importe peu, en effet, de savoir lequel des deux a voyagé, l'astrologue juge de la position des planètes relativement à la Terre, et il est bien plus commode de considérer les planètes comme se mouvant autour de la Terre prise comme point central, que d'employer le système opposé; en effet, dans le système géocentrique, nous notons les rapports des planètes telles qu'ils apparaissent, vus de la Terre, et en notons les effets sur les personnes au moment où de telles influences planétaires se font sentir; ainsi l'expérience nous a conduits à notre système actuel de jugement qui, pour cette raison, est aussi vrai qu'il l'a toujours été. Un dicton familier précise que "La preuve du pudding vient en le mangeant". La preuve de l'astrologie se trouve dans la vérité de ses prédictions, et tous ceux qui ont étudié honnêtement cette science et qui ont essayé de la mettre à l'épreuve pour eux-mêmes ne peuvent manquer de trouver cette vérité.

Il y a parfois des prédictions qui ne se réalisent pas, à cause d'une mauvaise interprétation de la part de l'astrologue; mais même en dépit de la faillibilité de l'astrologue, il y a un tel nombre de prédictions qui se sont réalisées qu'il est tout à fait impossible de les expliquer par des coïncidences.

Le système géocentrique est correct et considère tous les côtés de la nature de l'homme, tant spirituel que matériel. Le système héliocentrique a été forgé par des gens qui visent à suivre la science, et qui ne sont pas intéressés par le côté spirituel de la nature, c'est pourquoi ce système est le moins satisfaisant. En outre, ceux qui ont utilisé l'astrologie géocentrique depuis des siècles, ont consigné leurs observations des effets des planètes d'après ce point de vue, alors qu'une telle connaissance empirique en encore à ses débuts pour le système héliocentrique; aussi nous aimerions conseiller à l'auteur de la question de laisser ce dernier de côté.

### <h3 id="question-161">Question 161</h3>

Comment est-il possible de se mettre en bons termes avec Saturne? Je me suis trouvé sous son influence toute ma vie. Maladie, pauvreté, perte d'héritage et accidents sont assez fâcheux en eux-mêmes, mais Saturne peut-il aussi nous causer des peines sur le plan spirituel; peut-il mettre des barrières à notre épanouissement alors que notre esprit lutte pour le bien? Et sommes-nous libérés de son influence lorsque nous passons dans l'au-delà à la mort?

RÉPONSE - Les astrologues matérialistes parlent d'Uranus, de Saturne et de Mars comme de planètes maléfiques, alors que Vénus et Jupiter sont bénéfiques. Dans le Royaume de Dieu, il n'y a rien de mauvais. Ce qui paraît l'être n'est que du bien en devenir. On ne peut non plus imaginer que les influences de l'une des planètes agissent pour harasser les humains. Nous sommes venus dans ce monde pour faire certaines expériences nécessaires à notre épanouissement spirituel, et lorsque nous cherchons à comprendre les influences stellaires, nous verrons qu'elles sont de puissants facteurs qui nous aident justement à acquérir cette expérience. Saturne est le réformateur. Lorsque nous nous sommes éloignés du sentier de la droiture, intentionnellement ou non, on ne nous permet pas de continuer à mal faire, car Saturne est là pour nous en empêcher. Peut-être avons-nous fait un héritage; nous en faisons mauvais usage et le gaspillons. Ce faisant, il arrive que nous abusions de notre corps en festoyant. Alors un aspect à Saturne se forme, une maladie s'ensuit et nous tombons malade. Nous sommes forcés de nous mettre à la diète et de donner du repos à notre corps , puis nous recouvrons nos forces et nous sommes un nouvel être humain. Mais la question est celle-ci: avons-nous appris notre leçon? Pendant ce repos dû à la maladie, nous avons eu le temps de penser à la vie que nous avons menée. Avons-nous analysé notre vie afin de comprendre les causes qui nous ont rendu malade? Si oui, nous en avons profité. Car dans ce cas nous saurons faire mieux et nous éviterons à l'avenir les pièges qui ont causé notre maladie. Ou bien, notre héritage gaspillé, nous restons les poches vides, dans l'impossibilité d'obtenir aucun secours; nous sommes alors forcés de réfléchir et de nous frayer un chemin par nous-mêmes. Au temps où nous dissipions notre argent, nos talents ne nous servaient à rien. Devenus pauvres, nous pouvons en tirer parti, étant forcés de les utiliser pour faire notre part du travail de ce monde. Nous avons perdu notre héritage, mais le monde y a gagné un travailleur, et si nous avons appris notre leçon de cette façon, alors l'influence de Saturne a été une bénédiction déguisée.

Ainsi en est-il de toute chose dans un horoscope, qui peut paraître mauvaise. En outre, plus nous croissons spirituellement, moins l'influence de ces planètes dites maléfiques ou de ces aspects dits mauvais, nous affecte. Ils sont transmués en bien. Saturne n'apportera pas le désastre à l'homme spirituel, mais la persistance; pas la maladie, mais la force; et ainsi, en nous conformant aux lois de la nature, en vivant une vie en harmonie avec les astres, nous les gouvernons et nous changeons notre vie comme nous le désirons.

La plupart des gens sont entraînés par le courant et agissent selon les tendances indiquées par les influences stellaires. C'est pourquoi l'astrologue peut prédire avec une exactitude étonnante ce qu'ils feront. Mais plus une personne vit la vie spirituelle, plus elle devient un facteur qui doit être pris en considération, et l'astrologue se trompera d'autant plus dans ses prédictions, que la personne sera plus évoluée.

Les planètes nous aident dans notre évolution. Ce ne sont pas des corps de matière inanimée, ce sont les corps vivants, palpitants et vibrants, de grandes Intelligences spirituelles appelées dans la religion Chrétienne les Sept Esprits devant le Trône. A mesure que nous nous changeons, leur influence change à notre égard, mais nous n'échappons pas à cette influence par le simple incident de la mort. Lorsque l'aurore d'une vie nouvelle se lève pour nous, nous nous présenterons avec un nouvel horoscope, et si nous avons tenté de croître spirituellement, d'apprendre les leçons que les Anges Stellaires se sont efforcés de nous enseigner dans notre vie passée, nous aurons de nouveaux aspects et de nouvelles positions planétaires pour nous aider à progresser sur le sentier de l'évolution. Par contre, si nous nous sommes regimbés dans notre précédente existence, nous trouverons que les vis ont été un peu resserrées, et que nous nous trouvons placés sous des influences un peu plus fortes, de façon à nous faire enfin apprendre nos leçons. Et le plus tôt sera le mieux.

### <h3 id="question-162">Question 162</h3>

Comment pouvons-nous prier Saturne lorsqu'il est la planète régnante, nous causant des ennuis et de l'affliction?

RÉPONSE - Pour comprendre ce qu'est la prière, prenons l'exemple d'une usine de force motrice avec ses câbles qui la relient aux maisons de la ville. Dans chaque maison se trouve un commutateur qui, lorsqu'il est enclenché, permet à l'électricité produite dans l'usine d'être distribuée par les câbles, de pénétrer dans les demeures, de les éclairer, d'en faire fonctionner les moteurs, selon les lois de sa manifestation. Nous pouvons dire que Dieu d'abord, les Sept Esprits planétaires ensuite, correspondent à l'usine électrique qui est reliée à chacun de nous, et que la prière est le commutateur par lequel nous nous mettons en contact avec la lumière et la vie divines qui, alors, coulent en nous, nous éclairent pour notre élévation spirituelle.

Une des lois de l'électricité est qu'elle parcourt des fils de cuivre ou d'autres métaux, mais qu'elle est arrêtée par le verre. Et avant d'avoir l'électricité dans nos maisons, il nous faut un commutateur fait conformément à cette loi, c'est-à-dire avec un contact en cuivre. Si nous utilisons un contact de verre, nous n'obtiendrions pas d'électricité; le commutateur de verre serait le moyen le plus efficace d'empêcher l'électricité de parvenir à notre demeure. De même, si nos prières (qui correspondent au commutateur) sont conformes aux lois de Dieu, le dessein divin peut se manifester à travers nous et nos prières sont exaucées, mais si nous prions contrairement à la volonté de Dieu, notre prière agirait de la même manière que le contact de verre dans un circuit électrique.

De même qu'une grande nation envoie son ambassadeur et des plénipotentiaires à d'autres nations, ainsi les ambassadeurs de chacun des grands Anges Stellaires sont présents sur notre Terre. Leurs noms sont les suivants:

Ithuriel est l'ambassadeur d'Uranus,
Cassiel est l'ambassadeur de Saturne,
Zachariel est l'ambassadeur de Jupiter,
Samaël est l'ambassadeur de Mars,
Anaël est l'ambassadeur de Vénus,
Raphaël est l'ambassadeur de Mercure,
Michaël est l'ambassadeur du Soleil,
Gabriel est l'ambassadeur de la Lune.

La Lune est notre satellite et ne se trouve pas vis-à-vis de nous dans la même position que les autres planètes dont les ambassadeurs sont des Archanges, tandis que celui de la Lune, Gabriel, est un Ange.

Ordinairement, l'humanité prie Dieu. La plupart du temps, ses prières sont égoïstes et ignorantes. Elles ne peuvent attirer l'attention des ambassadeurs qui ont la charge des divers départements de la vie, mais généralement les Aides Invisibles qui travaillent à l'élévation de leurs frères humains en prennent soin, dans la mesure du possible. L'astrologue occulte, cependant, qui sait ce qu'il veut et qui est capable de travailler en harmonie avec les forces astrales, s'adresse directement aux ambassadeurs des Anges Stellaires et obtient de cette manière plus facilement ce qu'il désire. Il étudie les heures planétaires pendant lesquelles ces astres gouvernent et à ce moment il présente sa requête, qui est habituellement en faveur de quelqu'un d'autre, ou pour obtenir une illumination spirituelle concernant certaines affaires pour le bien commun.

<h2 id="section-8">Partie 8: Questions Concernant les Animaux</h2>

### <h3 id="question-163">Question 163</h3>

Pourquoi les animaux, qui sont une évolution inférieure, ont- ils un instinct paraissant bien plus sûr que la raison des êtres humains?

RÉPONSE - Cette question a trait à la descente de l'Ego dans la matière, mais il nous faut d'abord établir la différence entre les esprits-animaux distincts, et l'esprit-groupe qui est leur gardien. Les esprits-animaux distincts ne sont pas encore soi-conscients, par conséquent ils obéissent sans autre aux suggestions de leur esprit-groupe, entité appartenant à une évolution différente de la nôtre, qui fonctionne dans les Mondes Invisibles où les choses se manifestent mieux qu'elles ne le font ici-bas. Il s'ensuit donc que ce que nous appelons instinct correspond réellement aux suggestions de l'esprit-groupe qui, des Mondes Invisibles, guide les animaux.

Les esprits humains, eux, sont descendus directement dans le Monde Physique et sont, en conséquence, aveuglés jusqu'à un certain point par la matière plus dense de ce plan d'existence. Un exemple peut aider à comprendre pourquoi, bien que l'Ego soit extrêmement sage dans les mondes supérieurs, la matérialité croissante qu'il rencontre au cours sa descente dans le Monde Physique obscurcit nécessairement sa sagesse.

La main est l'outil le plus précieux de l'homme, et sa dextérité n'est peut- être nulle part plus apparente que chez le musicien. Un très bon musicien peut tirer de son instrument bien-aimé la mélodie la plus émouvante pour l'âme, grâce au toucher caressant de ses doigts exercés et sensibles; mais qu'il mette une paire de gants, et aussitôt le délicat toucher s'est évanoui; s'il ajoute une seconde paire de gants à la première, plus épais, il sera probablement incapable de produire même une mélodie, et s'il devait finalement enfiler une paire de moufles par dessus les gants, il serait tout à fait incapable de jouer, et ne produirait que des sons discordants, s'il essayait de jouer. Les paires de gants, sur les mains du musicien, représentent les différents véhicules dont se vêt l'esprit à sa descente dans la matière. Les moufles correspondent au corps physique.

Quiconque verrait le musicien essayer de jouer, moufles aux mains, sans l'avoir jamais entendu avant qu'il enfile des gants, pourrait douter de ses capacités à jouer, mais cette déduction serait fausse. L'Ego humain est dans une position semblable, ses pouvoirs spirituels ont été cachés par les véhicules dans lesquels il est aujourd'hui enfermé, mais il viendra un temps où il aura appris à utiliser ces véhicules correctement, et alors son pouvoir spirituel rayonnera d'une splendeur inimaginable pour le moment.

### <h3 id="question-164">Question 164</h3>

Quelle devrait être notre conduite envers les formes inférieures de la vie? 

Avons-nous le droit de tuer d'inoffensifs animaux qui sont en quelque sorte nos frères? 

Et que dire des insectes et des reptiles venimeux?

RÉPONSE - Il n'y a qu'Une Vie dans l'Univers, celle de Dieu. "En lui, nous avons la vie, le mouvement et l'être." Et non seulement nous-mêmes, mais tout ce qui vit est ainsi une manifestation de Dieu. En temps voulu, nous sommes appelés à devenir des créateurs comme Il est un Créateur, mais tant que nous détruisons brutalement les formes d'autres êtres, nous retardons notre avancement. L'auteur de la question a raison de dire que les animaux inférieurs sont nos frères, mais il est triste de constater qu'au lieu de prendre soin d'eux et de leur inspirer confiance et amour, nous agissons de manière à nous faire craindre de chaque animal à la surface du globe, cela à force de les détruire. Et la peur que nous entretenons de la vie microscopique, qui se manifeste sous forme de bacilles impossibles à détruire avec le fusil et le couteau, semble être la juste rétribution de notre conduite.

En ce qui concerne les insectes et les reptiles destructeurs, on peut dire qu'ils sont, dans bien des cas, la matérialisation de nos mauvaises pensées et le résultat de nos habitudes de malpropreté. La science a démontré comment nous pouvions nous en débarrasser par des mesures sanitaires appropriées, du moins dans une très grande mesure, sans qu'il soit nécessaire de les tuer. Les grands reptiles ne sont pas aussi dangereux qu'on le pense. Dans les temples aux Indes, où certaines classes de la population a cultivé une attitude tout à fait inoffensive en refusant de tuer même la moindre créature, on peut voir quotidiennement des serpents venimeux ramper parmi les gens assemblés là, sans jamais leur faire le moindre mal, et si nous cultivions la même attitude inoffensive à l'égard des créatures inférieures, elles apprendront bientôt à avoir confiance en nous au lieu de nous craindre. On raconte, dans des récits de voyage, que des marins ayant débarqué sur des îles désertes y ont trouvé des oiseaux parfaitement dépourvus de crainte, jusqu'à ce que nombre d'entre eux aient été tués par les barbares envahisseurs. Alors, ils ont alors appris à s'enfuir à l'approche de l'homme.

Nous avons, nous aussi, contribué à transformer des êtres humains en animaux de proie - nous les appelons voleurs, bandits - qui épient leurs semblables pour les voler, les blesser souvent, les tuer quelques fois; et tout cela résulte de notre rude traitement dicté par la peur. Si nous avions aimé, nous n'aurions pas éprouvé de crainte, car "l'amour parfait bannit toute crainte"; et si nous étions dépourvus de crainte, rien ne pourrait nous faire du mal, car une attitude sans crainte et confiante est une protection plus sûre qu'un revolver et un verrou. C'est pourquoi nous devrions cultiver cette attitude d'amour pour tout ce qui vit et respire; nous devrions cesser de tuer les animaux inférieurs par millions pour notre nourriture, et par sport, la pire forme de cruauté. Une attitude d'amour envers nos semblables générerait en eux des émotions semblables; serruriers et armuriers deviendraient bientôt inutiles. Nous nous plaignons des impôts énormes nécessaires à l'entretien d'une force de police forte, du mécanisme des cours de justice, des prisons et des pénitenciers, mais toutes ces institutions disparaîtraient comme par enchantement si nous remplacions la crainte par l'amour. La Bible nous dépeint le temps où le lion et le boeuf, le petit enfant et le serpent venimeux joueront ensemble en paix. Cela peut vraiment devenir une réalité, car les animaux de proie n'ont pas toujours été carnivores. Dans un lointain passé, l'homme a joué son rôle dans leur développement, et à l'avenir, ce sera sa tâche de changer ces conditions.

### <h3 id="question-165">Question 165</h3>

Les reptiles destructeurs et venimeux n'ont-ils pas été créés, en ce qui concerne leur forme, par les mauvaises pensées des hommes? N'est-ce donc pas un acte d'amour de les tuer et de libérer ainsi l'étincelle divine intérieure, afin qu'elle puisse occuper une forme plus élevée?

RÉPONSE - Aucune des formes animales que nous voyons autour de nous n'a été créée par l'homme. Toutes, de la plus supérieure à la plus inférieure, sont les émanations d'esprits-groupes, entités spirituelles appartenant à une évolution différente du règne humain. Mais l'homme est un créateur au moyen de ses pensées, et les mauvaises pensées, les pensées de crainte et de haine prennent effectivement forme et au cours des siècles elles se cristallisent en ce que nous appelons les bacilles. Les microbes des maladies infectieuses, en particulier, sont l'incarnation de la crainte et de la haine, et c'est pourquoi ils sont aussi vaincus par la force opposée, le courage. De même qu'un diapason commence à vibrer lorsqu'on en frappe un autre de même note, ainsi "vibrent" à leur tour les micro-organismes. Si nous nous approchons, tremblants de peur, d'une personne infectée d'une maladie contagieuse, nous attirerons très certainement sur nous les microbes pathogènes. Par contre, si nous sommes sans crainte, nous échapperons à l'infection, surtout si l'amour nous inspire. Jamais l'amour ne nous pousse à tuer dans le sens usuel du mot. Il est vrai que si nous pouvions agir directement avec la Vie de choses mauvaises et venimeuses et les aider à s'incarner dans une forme supérieure, nous pourrions faire du bien; mais, en premier lieu, nous ne sommes pas capables de juger quand la présente forme à vécu tout le temps nécessaire; et c'est pourquoi nous ne pouvons prendre la liberté et assumer la responsabilité de priver de son véhicule, par bonté, la vie qui bâtit une forme. L'unique cas où nous puissions parfois tuer vraiment par amour est quand nous voyons un animal incurablement mutilé; il nous est alors permis de mettre fin à ses souffrances en le tuant.

### <h3 id="question-166">Question 166</h3>

Qu'est-ce qu'un esprit-groupe, où est-il et à quoi ressemble-t- il?

RÉPONSE - De même que l'homme a un corps composé de nombreuses cellules dont chacune a une conscience individuelle, ainsi l'esprit-groupe est une entité fonctionnant dans les Mondes Spirituels, et possédant un corps spirituel composé de nombreux esprits-animaux distincts. L'esprit-groupe lui-même ne peut fonctionner dans le Monde Physique, mais il évolue en envoyant les différents esprits-animaux dans des corps dont il crée la forme et dont l'ensemble compose des espèces ou des familles, et il dirige tous ces corps d'animaux au moyen de suggestions que nous appelons instinct. Lorsque le corps d'un animal meurt, l'esprit de l'animal a acquis inconsciemment une certaine expérience par le fait d'avoir fonctionné dans un véhicule physique, et après un certain temps, cet esprit animal est réabsorbé dans le corps spirituel de l'esprit-groupe, où il reste un certain temps pendant que l'esprit-groupe assimile l'expérience faite par cet esprit animal distinct. Ainsi, avec le temps, l'esprit-groupe croît et évolue, en même temps que les esprits- animaux, ses pupilles. Ces esprits-animaux deviendront humains dans une future incarnation de la Terre, et alors l'esprit-groupe veillera sur eux à titre d'esprit de race ou de nation, jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient devenus tout à fait capables de prendre soin d'eux-mêmes individuellement. Les esprits-groupes des animaux sont dans le Monde du Désir et entourent la surface de la Terre. Les esprits-groupes des plantes sont dans la partie de la Région de la Pensée Concrète qui occupe le centre de la Terre; les esprits-groupes des minéraux ne sont pas encore précisément entrés dans l'atmosphère de notre Terre. Ils sont dans la Région de la Pensée Abstraite.

Les esprits-groupes des animaux se voient souvent dans le Monde du Désir avec des corps humains et des têtes d'animaux. Les dessins sur les temples égyptiens représentent d'une manière fruste l'aspect de ces esprits-groupes. Le clairvoyant exercé n'a aucune difficulté à s'entretenir avec eux et il a souvent l'occasion de s'émerveiller de leur érudition.

### <h3 id="question-167">Question 167</h3>

Les animaux relèvent-ils de la loi de cause à effet?

RÉPONSE - Non, pas dans le sens d'être responsable moralement. Evidemment, si un animal saute par la fenêtre d'un bâtiment élevé, cette cause produira des lésions qui dépendront de la gravité de sa chute. Mais, dans le cas d'un animal, l'effet produit est purement physique, tandis que l'homme qui commet délibérément une telle action, souffre non seulement de ses blessures, mais encore se sent moralement responsable de son corps; et la loi de cause à effet lui apportera la rétribution morale adéquate d'une nature telle qu'il apprendra, à l'avenir, à avoir soin de son instrument et à ne pas chercher à le détruire par de tels actes.

La raison pour laquelle l'animal n'a pas de responsabilité morale est qu'il ne possède pas le pouvoir de raisonner, mais agit habituellement d'après les directives de l'esprit-groupe que nous nommons instinct; et il se peut que cet instinct ait instillé chez l'animal une frayeur telle qu'il ait été poussé à un mouvement ayant eu pour effet de meurtrir son corps. Avant qu'une créature puisse être moralement responsable, elle doit avoir un certain libre arbitre et un certain libre choix, ainsi que le pouvoir de raisonner correctement; et c'est pourquoi nous répétons qu'étant dépourvus de ces attributs, les animaux ne relèvent pas moralement de la loi de cause à effet.

### <h3 id="question-168">Question 168</h3>

Les animaux vivent-ils après la mort?

RÉPONSE - Ce qui vit, c'est l'esprit, qui n'a ni commencement ni fin, IL EST. Mais l'auteur de la question veut probablement dire: subsistent-ils sous la forme d'animaux? A cette question, nous pouvons répondre oui, ils subsistent sous cette forme pendant un temps plus ou moins long, selon leur degré d'évolution, dans un corps du désir fait de la substance du Monde du Désir. Même les insectes qu'il nous arrive d'écraser sur le trottoir peuvent être observés par le clairvoyant qui les voit continuer d'avancer pendant quelques instants avant de disparaître peu à peu. Ils ne subsistent pas plus longtemps dans leur forme, car leur esprit retourne presque aussitôt à la source centrale de l'esprit-groupe. Dans le cas d'un cheval, d'une vache ou autre animal supérieur, le temps passé dans le Monde du Désir est plus long et l'animal y est plus conscient que ce n'est le cas des formes inférieures. Comme exemple, nous citerons un cas ayant attiré, il y a quelques années, l'attention du monde entier lorsque le romancier anglais Rider Haggard eut publié un rêve remarquable qu'il avait fait. Il avait un chien auquel il était très attaché. Une nuit, il rêva que le chien venait à lui, manifestant des signes d'embarras et de détresse, l'invitant à le suivre. Dans son rêve, il suivit le chien qui le conduisit vers un ruisseau. Là, au milieu des joncs, il montra à Rider Haggard que lui-même, le chien, gisait là, mort; et il y avait dans le regard qu'il adressait à son maître, une prière muette et angoissée demandant une explication.

Lorsque Rider Haggard s'éveilla le matin suivant, son rêve lui revint en mémoire de la manière la plus nette, mais il n'y fit pas autrement attention jusqu'à ce que, plus tard, dans la journée, on s'aperçut que le chien manquait. Après de vaines recherches dans le voisinage immédiat, Rider Haggard se rendit enfin à l'endroit qu'il avait vu en rêve. Il y trouva, dans les joncs, le corps du chien dans une position identique à celle où il l'avait vu dans son rêve. Bien entendu, aucune explication ne put être donnée; pour lui, c'était une expérience curieuse, rien de plus. Mais pour l'occultiste, il est clair que le chien intelligent, ayant trouvé la mort et se trouvant dans le Monde du Désir, était venu la nuit vers son maître endormi, donc en dehors de son corps physique, et l'avait amené à l'endroit de l'accident pour obtenir son assistance et des explications.

### <h3 id="question-169">Question 169</h3>

Lorsqu'un chien ou un chat favoris meurent, l'esprit-groupe auquel ils appartiennent meurt-il en même temps? Que devient l'âme de l'animal? Les soins, l'affection humaine qu'ils ont reçus l'aident-ils dans son voyage dans l'au-delà?

RÉPONSE - Cette question montre que son auteur n'a pas une idée bien précise de ce qu'est un esprit-groupe. De même que notre corps est composé d'innombrables cellules, ayant chacune sa petite vie propre, mais étant toutes assujetties à notre intelligence centrale, ainsi l'esprit-groupe d'une espèce d'animaux qui est une entité spirituelle appartenant à une évolution différente de la nôtre, possède un corps spirituel composé d'un grand nombre d'esprits-animaux distincts, en voie d'évolution. Cet esprit-groupe envoie chacun de ces esprits-animaux s'incarner de temps à autre dans des corps d'animaux de son espèce, un esprit dans chaque corps; à la mort des corps, ces esprits, ayant acquis pendant leur incarnation un degré plus élevé de conscience, retournent à l'esprit-groupe; cela aide l'esprit-groupe à évoluer et, en retour, il guide les esprits-animaux distincts dont il a la charge. Pas plus que n'importe quel autre esprit, l'esprit-groupe ne peut mourir. Il est le gardien des esprits d'animaux, et à mesure qu'ils évoluent, le corps spirituel de l'esprit-groupe subit une métamorphose. Lorsque les esprits- animaux distincts auront suffisamment évolué, ils deviendront des êtres humains individualisés; mais il continueront à être sous la garde du même esprit-groupe, tout comme les nations et les races humaines sont sous la domination d'un esprit de race. Les hommes ne deviendront maître d'eux-mêmes que lorsqu'ils auront évolué au-delà des liens familiaux et nationaux. C'est ce que le Christ entendait par ces mots, "A moins qu'un homme n'abandonne son père et sa mère, il ne peut me suivre", car le père et la mère sont des corps, des liens, des entraves. Les esprits n'ont ni père ni mère, mais ils ne font qu'un, en définitive.

Ainsi, à propos de ce que devient l'âme animale après la mort, nous pouvons dire qu'après avoir quitté le corps, elle retourne bientôt à l'esprit-groupe, et que l'affection et les soins que leur maître leur a prodigués aident beaucoup les animaux dans leur évolution, car, alors que les animaux sauvages agissent uniquement selon les commandements de l'esprit-groupe que nous appelons instinct, les animaux domestiques montrent une aptitude à penser qui dépasse complètement leur évolution normale actuelle. C'est de nous qu'ils ont reçu cette capacité, selon le principe de l'induction qui veut qu'un câble électrique de haut voltage placé à proximité d'un câble non chargé, induise dans celui-ci une charge d'électricité de voltage inférieur. D'une manière analogue, l'animal qui entre en contact avec des êtres humains n'est pas capable de penser par lui-même, mais il apprend à le faire, dans une certaine mesure, à ce contact. Et nous pouvons en déduire avec certitude que les animaux qui ont été domestiqués deviendront en temps voulu les instructeurs de leurs frères moins avancés.

### <h3 id="question-170">Question 170</h3>

Quelle sorte de substance les personnes ou les animaux émettent-ils qui fait qu'ils peuvent être suivis à la trace, comme par exemple les criminels par les limiers?

RÉPONSE - Un clairvoyant regardant pour la première fois les gens avec la vue éthérique est très étonné d'apercevoir, soit un jet d'étoiles, soit des pyramides superposées ou d'autres formes géométriques leur sortir des mains, du visage, et il se demande avec surprise ce qu'elles peuvent bien être. Plus tard, il apprend que ce sont les cristaux dont est composé le corps qui sont ainsi éliminés par la peau. La plupart de ces excrétions restent dans les vêtements et fournissent aux limiers et aux chiens, le point de départ nécessaire à leurs recherches. Lorsque ces atomes se putréfient, ils émettent des effluves semblables à ceux de tous les corps qui se décomposent. Nous percevons ces effluves lorsque du linge ou des vêtements usagés sont laissés pendant quelque temps sans être lavés ou nettoyés. Les chiens, ayant un odorat plus développé que les humains, peuvent faire la distinction entre les effluves d'une personne et d'une autre, et comme les atomes laissés par une personne fuyant la justice sont répandus le long du chemin qu'elle a pris, il est aisé au limier, pendant un court laps de temps, de les distinguer des atomes d'autres personnes ou animaux.

### <h3 id="question-171">Question 171</h3>

Quelle est l'origine de la vie?

RÉPONSE - Si l'on pose cette question à un homme de science, il commence par nous parler de protoplasme, de protyle ou d'autre chose de même nature, mais tout cela est la forme. Si petite, insignifiante et simple que soit cette forme, c'est toujours une forme, et du point de vue de l'occultiste, la question est mal posée, car l'esprit EST, ETAIT et SERA TOUJOURS. Comme le dit Sir Edwin Arnold dans son beau poème, "Le Chant Céleste":

```
"Jamais l'Esprit n'est né, Jamais l'Esprit ne cessera d'être;  
Jamais il n'y eut un temps où il n'était pas,  
Fin et Début sont des rêves! Ni né, ni mort, l'Esprit demeure sans changement à jamais;  
La mort en rien n'a jamais pu l'atteindre, Même quand sa demeure nous paraît morte.  

Ainsi l'homme, ayant ôté Son vieil habit longtemps porté,  
En en prenant un autre dit: Aujourd'hui je mets celui-ci.  
Ainsi l'Esprit va se défaire De l'habit de chair, doucement,  
Prendre son vol, pour hériter D'une demeure plus belle."  
```

C'est la Vie qui construit les formes et les emploie pour un temps de façon à pouvoir progresser. Lorsqu'elles ont cessé d'être utiles, la vie continue, laissant les formes qui, alors, sont mortes. Ainsi, la question devrait plutôt être, "Quelle est l'origine de la mort?" car la vie EST; elle n'a ni origine ni cessation.

### <h3 id="question-172">Question 172</h3>

Qu'est-ce que la matière? N'est-elle pas irréelle?

RÉPONSE - Il existe diverses théories de la matière. Le matérialiste soutient que la matière est la seule réalité, que tout est matière, et que rien n'existe sauf la matière. L'adhérent de la Science Chrétienne est d'une opinion diamétralement opposée. Pour lui, la matière est inexistante, illusoire, car tout ce qui est, est esprit. Ces deux théories sont l'antithèse l'une de l'autre, mais la vérité est entre les deux.

Lorsque Dieu désire se manifester, Il émane en Lui-même les formes-pensées de l'univers qu'Il désire créer, et ces idées archétypales sont esprit lorsqu'elles émanent, au début, dans cette source centrale. Mais, sous l'influence du temps et de l'espace, elles se cristallisent lentement et deviennent ce que nous connaissons sous l'aspect de matière. C'est là un processus analogue à celui que nous observons chez l'escargot. Les sécrétions de son corps mou et flexible se cristallisent graduellement en une coquille dure et insensible, qui est incapable de se mouvoir si elle n'est mise en mouvement par l'animal. De même que la maison de l'escargot est de l'escargot cristallisé, ainsi la matière est de l'esprit cristallisé. De même que la maison de l'escargot reste immobile lorsque lui-même ne l'actionne pas, ainsi la matière est immobile à moins d'être mue par l'esprit. Mais avec le temps, la coquille de l'escargot se désagrège. La matière dont elle était formée est brisée en particules minuscules et devient disponible pour la construction d'autres formes flexibles - elle peut redevenir un corps d'escargot. De la même manière, l'esprit cristallisé - la matière - est re-éthérisé et devient à nouveau esprit. La matière évolue aussi bien que l'esprit, car elle s'éthérise, s'assouplit, réagit mieux aux impulsions de l'esprit lorsqu'elle se construit, forme après forme, périodiquement.

Nous pouvons donc dire avec l'adhérent de la Science Chrétienne que tout est esprit, que ce qui apparaît comme matière est, en réalité, de l'esprit en état de cristallisation, et nous pouvons aussi admettre avec le matérialiste que tout est matière, car l'esprit qui n'est pas encore cristallisé en matière se cristallisera finalement. C'est une erreur de considérer quoi que ce soit dans l'Univers de Dieu comme irréel; esprit et matière sont tous deux réels. Ce sont les pôles positif et négatif de Dieu.

### <h3 id="question-173">Question 173</h3>

Vous avez dit dans une de vos conférences précédentes que la Terre est le corps d'un Esprit qui donne sa vie aux habitants qui vivent à sa surface. Pourquoi donne-t-il fleurs et fruits aux uns, séismes et famines aux autres?

RÉPONSE - Pendant l'intervalle de temps compris entre une mort et une renaissance, les esprits désincarnés qui ont atteint le Deuxième Ciel où sont les archétypes de tout ce qui existe, construisent leur milieu futur dans lequel ils récolteront ce qu'ils ont semé. S'ils ont été diligents dans leurs vies passées, s'ils ont cultivé le sol et fait pousser deux brins d'herbe là où il n'y en avait qu'un, ils se construiront une terre plus fertile encore, capable de produire avec plus d'abondance et moins de peine. S'ils ont passé leur vie à rêver au Nirvana, lieu céleste de repos et d'indolence, s'ils ont préféré discuter métaphysique plutôt que de s'occuper des choses matérielles, ils continueront à faire de même au Deuxième Ciel; ainsi, lorsqu'ils reviendront vivre ici-bas, leurs terres seront arides et ils souffriront de famines, d'inondations, de séismes, jusqu'à ce qu'ils se rendent compte de la nécessité de pourvoir aux conditions matérielles de leur existence. De cette façon, ils finiront par apprendre leur leçon et feront l'effort nécessaire pour conquérir ce monde, comme nous l'avons fait en Occident, car il est évident que l'auteur de la question fait allusion aux peuples orientaux qui souffrent de la famine et des inondations. Ce sont nos jeunes frères, en retard sur nous dans leur évolution; ils doivent marcher sur nos traces et, pour cela, apprendre à oublier temporairement les mondes spirituels pour parvenir au développement que, seul, le monde matériel peut leur donner. Il y a donc un dessein délibéré à l'origine de la famine qui est actuellement leur lot, tout comme il y a un dessein profond à notre prospérité, La famine des Orientaux les amènera finalement à s'attacher à des conditions plus matérielles. Par contre, nous qui possédons une terre fertile où abondent tous les biens de ce monde, où d'ingénieuses inventions rendent la vie plus facile, nous nous dirons finalement, une fois rassasiés de toutes ces bénédictions matérielles, "A quoi bon tout cela? Donnez-nous plutôt des choses spirituelles", et ceci nous vaudra un développement spirituel bien supérieur à celui des peuples de l'Orient.

### <h3 id="question-174">Question 174</h3>

Quel est le sens de la maxime, "Homme, connais-toi toi-même"?

RÉPONSE - Cette maxime fut trouvée au-dessus de l'entrée d'un temple des mystères, en Grèce, pour indiquer le fait que l'homme a l'obligation de comprendre parfaitement le mystère de sa propre nature, mystère beaucoup plus profond qu'il ne semble en apparence. Ceci, d'après le principe de l'axiome hermétique, "Ce qui est en bas est comme ce qui est en haut". En se comprenant lui-même et en se connaissant lui-même, l'homme sera capable, par analogie, de connaître Dieu. Car il est vrai que "l'homme a été fait à l'image de Dieu".

Mais pour se connaître lui-même, il est non seulement nécessaire que l'homme comprenne ce qu'il voit, son corps physique, mais aussi ses corps invisibles, qui sont les causes de ses pensées, de ses sentiments, et de ses émotions. C'était là l'enseignement donné dans les Temples des Mystères.

Cette maxime a encore une autre signification bien plus profonde. Lorsque nous cherchons les causes de toutes les afflictions, de toutes les misères dans le monde, nous devons remonter aux premières époques de l'existence de la Terre pour résoudre notre problème. Aux deux premières époques, l'Epoque Polaire et l'Epoque Hyperboréenne, l'homme était une unité créatrice complète, capable d'émettre de lui-même les forces qui généraient un corps pour un autre être. Mais à l'Epoque Lémurienne, lorsqu'il devint nécessaire de construire un cerveau et un larynx, la force sexuelle fut divisée et une moitié fut retenue pour accomplir ce dessein. Seule l'autre moitié resta disponible pour la génération. L'homme cessa alors de se connaître lui-même, mais "Adam connut sa femme" et, en conséquence, elle lui donna des enfants.

L'esprit a la connaissance innée de sa propre nature divine créatrice, et se rebelle secrètement contre la nécessité de chercher la coopération d'un autre être pour la génération. Il en est résulté afflictions, douleurs et souffrances qui sont venues dans le monde et qui persisteront tant que l'actuel mode de procréation rend nécessaire la coopération de deux êtres pour perpétuer l'espèce. Et c'est le but glorieux assigné à l'humanité pour l'avenir - la réunion des deux pôles de la force créatrice, qui fera à nouveau de l'homme un créateur individuel complet en lui-même - que suggèrent ces mots mystérieux, "Homme, connais-toi toi-même".

L'Apôtre Jean, dans sa première Epître, (3:8-9), nous indique le moyen d'y parvenir lorsqu'il dit, "Celui qui commet le péché est du diable (...) C'est pour détruire les oeuvres du diable que le Fils de Dieu est apparu. Quiconque est né de Dieu ne commet pas de péché, parce que sa semence demeure en lui."

Lorsque l'homme se laisse aller aux penchants de sa nature animale et qu'il fait un usage anormal de sa force sexuelle, l'idiotie peut en résulter, tandis que les pensées d'un homme spirituel sont pures, chastes et pleines de sagesse.

Actuellement, la coopération des deux sexes est nécessaire à la procréation de véhicules pour les Egos en voie de renaissance; mais le temps viendra où l'homme cessera de créer de cette manière. Il se connaîtra lui-même. La pensée concentrée, comme la semence, demeurera en lui, et il la manifestera au moyen du larynx en un Verbe Créateur qui formera les choses dans le Monde Physique. L'être humain n'aura plus besoin de chercher la coopération d'un autre être pour fournir de nouveaux véhicules. Ceci lui était enseigné dans les Ecoles des Mystères, qui sont autant de jalons placés sur le sentier de la connaissance, et c'est pourquoi la maxime "Homme, connais-toi toi-même" était inscrite sur le Temple des Oracles de Delphes.

### <h3 id="question-175">Question 175</h3>

Qu'est-ce que le Saint-Graal?

RÉPONSE - L'histoire du Saint-Graal est l'un des mythes employés par les grands guides de l'humanité pour nous présenter sous forme de symboles des vérités spirituelles autrefois incompréhensibles à notre intelligence enfantine.

L'histoire du Graal, diversement contée, se retrouve dans toutes les races primitives, aussi loin qu'existe la trace d'un enseignement religieux, et des livres, qui rempliraient des bibliothèques, ont été écrits sur cette merveilleuse panacée mystique qui guérit tous les maux.

Au Moyen Age, maintes versions de cette légende étaient récitées par les ménestrels, les chanteurs ambulants et les troubadours. La plus belle, peut- être, était la simple version de Wolfram von Eschenbach qui a été interprétée par le grand compositeur Richard Wagner, dans son célèbre drame musical "Parsifal".

L'histoire relate que le soir du dernier repas de notre Sauveur avec Ses disciples, Il ait bu dans une certaine coupe ou calice et que, plus tard, quand le sang de vie coula de Son flanc transpercé, Joseph d'Arimathie ait recueilli dans ce même calice le sang de vie de notre Sauveur mourant. Il prit aussi la lance avec laquelle la blessure avait été faite. Pendant plusieurs années, il conserva ces reliques, et le pouvoir donneur de vie du sang de notre Saveur était si merveilleux qu'il l'a soutenu au cours de toutes ses privations, en prison, et dans ses courses errantes. A la fin, les reliques furent transportées au Ciel et confiées à la garde des Anges. Mais une nuit, un messager mystique, envoyé par Dieu, apparut à Titurel, un saint homme, lui enjoignant de construire un château, haut dans les airs, au sommet d'une montagne et d'y réunir une assemblée de chevaliers qui devaient être chastes et purs. Les Chevaliers du Graal étaient autorisés à contempler les reliques sacrées à certaines époques de l'année, ce qui leur donnait le désir et le pouvoir d'aller dans le monde pour y accomplir des actes héroïques d'ordre spirituel. Plus tard, Titurel confia la garde du Saint-Graal à son fils Amfortas, et sous le règne de ce dernier, une terrible calamité frappa les Chevaliers du Graal.

Au-dessous du château, dans une "vallée impie", demeurait un chevalier noir du nom de Klingsor qui désirait devenir Chevalier du Graal. Il n'était pas chaste, et pour répondre aux conditions requises, il se mutila de manière à ne pouvoir satisfaire ses désirs. Mais lorsqu'il adressa sa requête à Titurel, celui-ci lut dans son coeur, et lui refusa son admission. Alors Klingsor jura que s'il ne pouvait servir le Graal, le Graal le servirait. Il peupla le jardin de son château magique de chimériques filles-fleurs qui guettaient les Chevaliers du Graal au passage, les séduisaient, et ainsi les disqualifiaient pour leur service auprès du Graal.

Craignant que tous les Chevaliers ne deviennent prisonniers de Klingsor, Amfortas décida de combattre le magicien noir. Il emporta avec lui la Sainte Lance pour accomplir son dessein. Mais Klingsor évoqua Kundry, créature à la double existence; tantôt servante fidèle et zélée du Graal, tantôt involontaire instrument de Klingsor. Lorsqu'elle sert le Graal, elle est humble, docile, vêtue modestement. Sous le charme de Klingsor, elle devient une femme belle à ravir, aux charmes séducteurs dont elle est obligée d'user comme l'ordonne son maître, car il exerce plein pouvoir sur elle, étant insensible à ses charmes en raison de sa mutilation.

Kundry rencontre Amfortas qui tombe sous son charme. Tandis qu'il repose entre ses bras, la Lance lui tombe des mains. Klingsor à l'affût s'en empare et lui inflige une blessure inguérissable. Depuis de longues années, le roi souffre le martyre, particulièrement lorsqu'il dévoile le Saint-Graal pour le service de ses chevaliers. Alors la blessure recommence à saigner, lui causant les plus atroces souffrances.

En résumé, pour ne donner qu'une des interprétations valables attachées au mystère du Graal, car chaque véritable mythe en a plusieurs, Kundry représente le corps dense négatif, qui est tantôt gouverné par la nature supérieure symbolisée par les chevaliers du Graal, tantôt sous l'emprise de la nature inférieure symbolisée par Klingsor, qui tente l'esprit afin qu'il renonce à ses idéals élevés, et le fait souffrir, s'il cède à la tentation. En Parsifal, chaste et candide, nous voyons l'homme qui triomphe et qui réussit ainsi à devenir un gardien du Graal.

Au matin du vendredi saint de l'année 1857, Richard Wagner, dans la Villa Wesendonck au bord du lac de Zurich, contemplait partout autour de lui la nature souriante; le Soleil brillait de tout son éclat et, de myriades de graines enfouies dans la terre avaient germé des plantes et des fleurs innombrables. Une pensée alors le frappa, "Quelle peut être la relation entre la mort du Sauveur, à cette époque de l'année, et cette germination multiple de la vie?" Il était bien près de tenir la clé du mystère du Graal, car le Graal était une des nombreuses Ecoles des Mystères qui existait au Moyen Age. Les légendes du Roi Arthur et des Chevaliers de la Table Ronde ne sont pas des fables, mais des faits. Une Ecole des Mystères de ce genre a existé au Pays de Galles jusqu'au temps de la Reine Elisabeth. Ces Ecoles des Mystères existent encore aujourd'hui, bien qu'elles ne soient pas aussi publiquement connues qu'elles l'étaient à l'époque plus spirituelle du Moyen Age. Le Mystère du Roi Arthur était davantage en rapport avec le côté matériel et temporel de la vie que le Mystère du Graal, qui était entièrement pur et spirituel. Et là, l'enseignement donné à l'étudiant n'était pas fait de paroles, mais le sentiment lui était donné, un enseignement intérieur, que nous pourrions exprimer comme suit:

Tu vois autour de toi les différents règnes de la nature. Il y a l'homme, l'animal, la plante et le minéral. La vie qui est en chacun de ces règnes est la vie universelle de Dieu qui se manifeste par toutes ces formes variées. Lorsque ces formes se désagrègent, il devient nécessaire de les remplacer par d'autres, et la procréation remplit ce but. Dans le règne végétal, qui est au- dessous de nous, cette activité est chaste, pure et immaculée, sans passion aucune.

Dans le royaume des Dieux, qui sont au-dessus de nous, cette activité est aussi exercée comme un processus de régénération, qui est pur et saint. Mais dans les règnes qui se trouvent entre la plante et les Dieux, les conditions sont l'inverse de la chasteté. L'homme et l'animal sont passionnés. L'homme est, de fait, la plante invertie. La plante dirige sans honte vers le Soleil son organe créateur, la fleur, objet de beauté et d'enchantement, pure, chaste, sans passion. L'homme tourne son organe créateur vers la terre; il le cache avec honte car il est rempli de passion. Dans l'avenir, l'homme est destiné à devenir un dieu, il devra employer sa capacité créatrice au profit d'autrui et non pour le plaisir des sens. Ainsi avec le temps, l'homme doit devenir semblable à la plante, mais à un niveau plus élevé. Alors, vois ce symbole: le calice de la plante qui renferme la semence est la coupe du Graal, et la lance qui fait naître cette semence de la fleur est le rayon du Soleil. Toi aussi, tu dois apprendre à prendre la force solaire, qui est le constructeur de toutes les formes, et à l'utiliser sans passion dans ton organe créateur, afin que ce que tu crées soit conçu de façon immaculée et non, comme maintenant, procréé dans le péché.

La sève de la plante coule incolore, pure, chaste à travers sa tige et ses feuilles vertes. Ton sang est rouge et rempli de passion, mais par la régénération ce sang doit être purifié par la force spirituelle qui te viendra du Soleil spirituel, comme les forces du Soleil physique produisent la sève de la plante. Etant ainsi régénéré, tu mourras en tant qu'homme pour ressusciter comme un dieu.

Quel rapport y a-t-il entre les constructeurs des pyramides d'Egypte et ceux des pyramides de l'Amérique Centrale? Laquelle de ces deux civilisations est la plus ancienne?

RÉPONSE - Des recherches anthropologiques ont démontré que les races Noires ont la tête longue et étroite, les orbites des yeux étroites, les cheveux plats. Les races Mongoles, les Amérindiens, etc., ont la tête ronde, les orbites ronde, les cheveux ronds. Les races blanches ont la tête ovale, les orbites et les cheveux ovales également. Il y a donc sur la Terre trois espèces humaines: les Noirs sont les descendants de la Race Lémurienne et vivaient à la Troisième Epoque de notre Terre; les Mongoles, les Amérindiens, etc., sont les descendants des peuples Atlantéens, et les races blanches sont les actuels Aryens. A l'examen, on trouve que les Egyptiens appartiennent aux races Aryennes actuelles, tandis que les Aztèques ont les particularités de crâne, d'orbite et de cheveu propres aux peuples Atlantéens. Par conséquent, la civilisation des Aztèques est antérieure à celle des Egyptiens.

On n'a écrit que peu de choses au sujet des pyramides de l'Amérique Centrale; par contre, Piazzi Smith et Richard Proctor, tous deux astronomes de profession, ont beaucoup écrit sur les pyramides d'Egypte, et se sont efforcés de découvrir leur raison d'être. D'après les mesures de ces pyramides, Piazzi Smith a édifié une théorie selon laquelle elles auraient été construites par des architectes divins, théorie que Richard Proctor tourne en ridicule, bien qu'il reconnaisse que ces mesures la soutiennent, mais il les attribue à une coïncidence: que la base de la Pyramide mesure autant de centaines de pouces qu'il y a de jours dans l'année; que les diagonales de la base accusent le même nombre de pouces qu'il y a d'années dans la grande année sidérale du monde est, aux yeux du Professeur Proctor, un simple hasard. Pourtant, ces coïncidences sont si nombreuses que, pour un observateur impartial, elles ne peuvent paraître que l'expression d'un dessein bien défini. Le Professeur Proctor, tout en n'acceptant pas l'opinion que ces pyramides aient été construire dans un but astrologique, donne cependant une valeur accrue à son témoignage lorsqu'il admet que, de toutes les théories avancées concernant la raison d'être de ces pyramides, celle de Piazzi Smith est la seule qui puisse soutenir l'épreuve d'une contre-évidence. Ainsi, tout en qualifiant cette théorie d'extravagante, il avoue qu'elle est, selon toute évidence, la seule acceptable.

En réalité, les Pyramides étaient des temples d'initiation construits par les Hiérophantes des Mystères Mineurs, et comme l'initiation des candidats est fondée sur le passage des corps célestes dans les douze signes du zodiaque, il est naturel que les temples d'initiation renferment toutes les mesures cosmiques. En Egypte, seule la pyramide de Chéops était employée à cet usage. Les autres ne sont que de simples imitations construites à des époques plus récentes par quelques Pharaons. Les Mystères Mineurs ont existé dans diverses parties du monde à des époques différentes, en Egypte, en Grèce, dans l'Inde et aussi en Amérique Centrale. Ainsi, le rapport entre les constructeurs des pyramides de l'une et de l'autre des différentes parties du monde est que tous étaient des Hiérophantes des Mystères Mineurs, et que leurs temples servaient à des fins d'initiation.

### <h3 id="question-177">Question 177</h3>

Quelle est la différence essentielle entre les enseignements de la Philosophie Rosicrucienne et ceux de l'Eglise traditionnelle?

RÉPONSE - Il y en a plusieurs, mais la principale est peut-être l'enseignement traditionnel d'après lequel, à chaque naissance, une âme nouvellement créée par Dieu entre dans l'existence matérielle, vit ici-bas dans un corps matériel durant un temps plus ou moins long, puis à la mort, passe dans l'invisible au- delà pour y rester pendant toute l'éternité dans un état de bonheur ou de détresse qui dépend de la vie qu'elle aura menée ici-bas.

L'enseignement Rosicrucien précise que toute âme est une partie intégrante de Dieu, partie qui, au cours d'existences répétées dans des corps matériels qui s'améliorent graduellement, cherche à acquérir de l'expérience, et c'est pourquoi elle entre dans l'existence physique et en sort plusieurs fois; à chaque existence, elle recueille un peu plus d'expérience, et avec le temps, la somme accrue de ces expériences la conduit de l'ignorance à l'omniscience, et de l'impuissance à la toute-puissance.

Notre sens de la justice se révolte devant un enseignement qui envoie une âme dans un milieu cultivé, une noble famille, où elle a les avantages de la richesse, où des enseignements moraux lui sont inculqués dès l'enfance, mais qui envoie une autre âme dans un taudis, chez un père voleur, une mère immorale peut-être, qui lui apprennent à mentir, à voler, etc. Si nous devons faire une seule apparition sur la terre, et être tous jugés d'après les mêmes lois, tous doivent avoir les mêmes chances au départ. Or, nous savons qu'il n'y a pas deux personnes qui traversent les mêmes expériences dans la vie; l'une rencontre de nombreuses tentations, tandis que l'autre est comparativement exempte de tribulations. Si l'une est placée dans un milieu moral et l'autre dans un environnement immoral, il n'est pas juste d'envoyer la première dans un ciel de joie et de félicité éternelle, pour avoir fait le bien qu'il lui était tout naturel de faire, et la seconde en enfer pour avoir menti et volé, alors que le milieu dans lequel elle était placée était tel qu'elle ne pouvait s'en empêcher.

C'est pourquoi l'enseignement Rosicrucien maintient que nous naissons dans le milieu le mieux adapté aux expériences de nos vies antérieures, et que nous recevons exactement ce que nous méritons dans tous les cas; que toutes les expériences par lesquelles nous passons sont exactement celles dont nous avons besoin pour donner l'impulsion nécessaire à la prochaine étape de notre épanouissement.

### <h3 id="question-178">Question 178</h3>

Voulez-vous préciser en quoi la Philosophie Rosicrucienne diffère de la Théosophie?

RÉPONSE - Nous nous intéressons moins à rechercher les différences qu'à trouver les points de concordance. On peut dire cependant que la Philosophie Rosicrucienne est l'enseignement Occidental donné aux peuples de l'Occident pour leur avancement. Si nous donnons au mot Théosophie la signification Theos Sophia (Divine Sagesse), alors, à l'évidence, la Philosophie Rosicrucienne n'est qu'une partie de la Sagesse Divine, comme tous les autres systèmes religieux. Mais si nous entendons par théosophie, la philosophie propagée par la Société ou les Sociétés Théosophiques, car il y a plusieurs tendances, alors nous pouvons dire que l'enseignement Rosicrucien est beaucoup plus vaste et complet. En outre, en enseignant leur philosophie, les Rosicruciens sont diamétralement opposés à la méthode de la Société Théosophique, qui a pour objets:

1/. La formation d'un noyau de Fraternité Universelle.

2/. L'étude des religions comparées, et

3/. L'investigation sur les lois inexpliquées de la nature et sur les pouvoirs latents en l'homme.

Les Frères de la Rose-Croix soutiennent que la majorité des gens avancés sont en sympathie avec l'idée de Fraternité Universelle, et qu'il n'est pas besoin d'être théosophe pour avoir cette idée à coeur. Nombre d'autres sociétés ont des idées altruistes, en accord avec celles de fraternité. Beaucoup de savants étudient les religions comparées, et le font très bien. Il n'est donc pas nécessaire d'être théosophe pour poursuivre cet objectif, par contre, il faut être occultiste pour accomplir le troisième dessein de la Société Théosophique, à savoir, l'étude des lois inexpliquées de la nature et des pouvoirs latents en l'homme.

C'est pourquoi les Rosicruciens recommandent que toutes les pensées soient concentrées sur le fait de vivre une vie telle, et sur la pratique d'exercices tels, que les pouvoirs latents se développeront en chaque aspirant, afin qu'il puisse voir et connaître les mondes invisibles d'où proviennent les causes que nous voyons manifestées ici-bas. Quand cet objectif est atteint, et pas avant, l'aspirant est alors capable de faire des recherches sur les lois inexpliquées de la nature. Il se trouve également dans une bien meilleure position que les savants, ou n'importe qui d'autre, pour étudier les religions comparées, car il voit la source centrale d'où coulent toutes les religions, chacune d'elles étant adaptée au peuple auquel elle est donnée. Il voit également comment ces religions correspondent au grand plan de l'évolution; et lorsqu'il est devenu capable d'atteindre à la conscience des mondes intérieurs, l'unité de la vie y est si évidente qu'il n'a plus besoin de s'inquiéter du premier objet de la Société Théosophique: l'universalité de la Vie Une qui fait de la fraternité un fait de la nature, au-delà de la nécessité d'être énoncé.

Pour parvenir à ce dernier degré, nous devons avoir une vue exact du sujet. Nous pouvons prêcher à un fourneau que son devoir est de chauffer et de nous réchauffer, mais tant que nous ne nous serons pas conformés aux lois de sa nature en le garnissant de combustible, nous prêchons dans le vide. D'après le même principe, tant que nous n'aurons pas atteint ce degré d'exaltation où nos coeurs sont pénétrés de l'amour divin, nous pouvons prêcher et parler d'enseignements concernant la Fraternité Universelle, cela n'avancera à rien. Si nous remplissons le fourneau de combustible, il nous réchauffera, et si nous remplissions nos coeurs d'amour, ils rayonneront cette qualité, sans qu'il soit nécessaire de fixer des objectifs tel que le premier mentionné plus haut.

C'est pourquoi, la principale différence entre la Société Théosophique et The Rosicrucian Fellowship est une inversion complète de méthode. Car, là où la Société Théosophique vise à former un noyau de Fraternité Universelle par l'étude des religions comparées, et ne considère qu'en dernier lieu le développement du côté caché de la nature humaine - d'aucuns même décrient le développement des pouvoirs cachés - l'enseignement Rosicrucien exhorte l'aspirant à vivre la vie avant tout, à concentrer toute les énergies de son être de manière à être apte à posséder les pouvoirs de l'âme absolument essentiels aux investigations qu'il envisage.

### <h3 id="question-179">Question 179</h3>

La Loge Blanche de la Société Théosophique et le Temple des Rosicruciens sont-ils identiques?

RÉPONSE - Non, la Société Théosophique est une organisation exotérique qui répand une certaine philosophie dérivée en grande partie des Religions Orientales, tandis que The Rosicrucian Fellowship a pour objet de diffuser les enseignements de l'Ecole Occidentale des Mystères, l'Ordre des Rosicruciens, qui est secret et qui n'est accessible à personne sans invitation directe.

En ce qui concerne la relation entre l'Ordre des Rosicruciens ou autres Ordres des Mystères de même nature, et la Loge Blanche, nous pouvons dire qu'il y a, en différents lieux de la Terre, un certain nombre de ces écoles des Mystères Mineurs; que chacune d'elles est composée de douze frères et d'un treizième membre. Ce dernier est le lien entre les différentes écoles, et tous ces chefs, ou treizièmes membres, composent ce qu'on appelle la Loge Blanche, soit un conseil suprême des Aînés de nos Frères ayant actuellement la charge entière de l'évolution humaine, et qui nous préparent la marche à suivre.

### <h3 id="question-180">Question 180</h3>

Qu'entendez-vous par le terme "Maître", et The Rosicrucian Fellowship est-elle inspirée par eux?

RÉPONSE - En Extrême-Orient, l'élève qui aspire à la vie supérieure cherche un "Maître" auquel il est attaché corps et âme, dont il doit suivre aveuglément les instructions, sans la moindre hésitation ou sans manifester la moindre curiosité concernant le but des directives qui lui sont données. Il doit rendre au maître tous les services personnels qui lui sont demandés, quels que soient le coût ou la gêne pouvant en résulter pour lui; en un mot, il devient virtuellement l'esclave d'un maître qui agit bien souvent comme un véritable surveillant.

Cette méthode peut paraître bien barbare, mais elle est, sans nul doute, la seule capable de triompher de l'indolence des Orientaux; appartenant à une classe d'Egos restée en arrière, ils sont accoutumés à la servilité et à la soumission, de sorte que leurs sentiments les plus raffinés n'en sont pas affectés. En Occident, au contraire, une telle méthode serait tout à fait dégradante, car nous sommes arrivés à un tel degré d'individualité que nous pouvons seulement progresser par l'action venue de l'intérieur, et si nous faisons des promesses ou des voeux, nous ne devons nous engager envers aucune autre personne que nous-même; car si nous ne pouvons pas tenir les promesses que nous nous sommes faites, nous ne pourrons certainement pas tenir les promesses faites aux autres.

De plus, il nous est possible de manquer aux promesses faites à autrui et l'abuser en lui faisant croire que nous les avons tenues, mais nous ne pouvons nous tromper nous-mêmes. Si nous manquons à une promesse que nous nous sommes faite, nous le savons immédiatement, et c'est la raison pour laquelle, en Occident, l'aspirant est instruit à prendre ses engagements envers lui-même, car ces engagement sont plus forts que ceux qui peuvent être pris vis-à-vis d'une tierce personne. L'instructeur, en Occident, est l'ami et le conseiller le plus intime de l'élève, car il suit l'exemple du Christ Qui a dit à Ses disciples, "Ceci est mon commandement, que vous vous aimiez les uns les autres comme je vous ai aimés (...) Vous êtes mes amis si vous faites ce que je vous commande; par conséquent, je ne vous appellerai pas serviteurs, parce que le serviteur ne sait pas ce que fait son maître; mais je vous ai appelés mes amis, parce que je vous ai fait connaître tout ce que j'ai entendu de mon Père" (Jean 15:12-15).

The Rosicrucian Fellowship n'est pas soutenue par ces instructeurs ni inspirée par eux; ils ont donné à l'auteur certains enseignements à condition qu'il les répande dans la mesure de ses moyens, et ils ont annoncé qu'ils étaient prêts à aider ceux qui se qualifieraient pour recevoir cette instruction. Les étudiants de ces enseignements se sont groupés pour bénéficier d'une étude en association, mais il n'y a pas d'organisation rigoureuse et fixe, et il n'est pas prévu d'en créer une, mais de laisser les gens se procurer cet enseignement là où cela leur convient. Nous préférons qu'ils restent dans leur église.

### <h3 id="question-181">Question 181</h3>

Si une personne qui croit sincèrement aux enseignements avancés par les Rosicruciens affirme en toute certitude qu'ils sont vrais, ne risque- t-elle pas de devenir dogmatique et intolérante en ce qui concerne les opinions d'autrui? Et quelle devrait être son attitude à l'égard de ceux qui refusent d'accepter ces enseignements?

RÉPONSE - Il est de la plus grande importance de reconnaître le fait que nous ne pouvons, du moins dans notre présente existence limitée, arriver à connaître la vérité toute entière. Par conséquent, ce qui nous semble être "la vérité, toute la vérité" n'est probablement, après tout, qu'un aspect de la vérité. A mesure que nous évoluons et que nous devenons capables de mieux comprendre, notre conception de la vie, du monde et de Dieu change. Nous devons donc toujours avoir l'esprit ouvert, afin de pouvoir recevoir une nouvelle vérité; et bien que nous ne devions jamais être tièdes, mais toujours fervents pour ce que nous croyons être la vérité, nous ne devrions jamais oublier qu'il y a toujours de plus grandes vérités que nous n'avons pas encore appris. Alors nous sommes larges d'esprit et ne nous lions ni à un credo ni à des préjugés

Certaines personnes qui ont découvert quelque chose qui les séduit comme étant une vérité, sont saisies d'un tel enthousiasme qu'elles entreprennent une véritable croisade afin de faire partager aux autres leur trouvaille. C'est là une grande erreur. Si nous nous trouvons parmi les membres d'une église, et commençons à poser des questions qui apportent le doute dans leur esprit et les ébranlent dans leur foi, nous pouvons aisément créer en eux un trouble regrettable. Si ce que nous avons à leur apprendre trouve un écho en eux, si cela est pour eux une ancre de salut à laquelle ils peuvent accrocher une foi nouvelle et plus élevée, c'est tant mieux. Mais si ce que nous avons à leur apporter est pour eux inaccessible ou inacceptable, nous risquons de les amener à un état d'esprit très malheureux et ils peuvent se tourner vers le matérialisme, l'athéisme ou tout autre attitude éminemment sceptique. Nous porterons alors la responsabilité de cet état de choses. Nous devons donc nous faire une règle d'être toujours discrets au sujet de nos convictions, sans jamais négliger de dire un petit mot quand l'occasion se présente, et si ce mot suscite une demande de renseignements, répondons-y sans hésiter. De cette manière, nous pouvons encourager graduellement notre interlocuteur à parler. Ainsi, il ne parlera que s'il cherche vraiment, et si nous nous rendons compte qu'il désire des renseignements, nous devons lui donner tout ce qu'il désire, et le donner gratuitement. Mais nous répétons que c'est une responsabilité sérieuse que d'imposer notre opinion à ceux qui ne sont pas disposés ou pas prêts à la recevoir.

### <h3 id="question-182">Question 182</h3>

Comment se fait-il que, parmi ceux qui étudient la haute philosophie, il y en ait si peu qui s'occupent à améliorer les conditions sociales, telles que l'abolition de l'esclavage des salariés, aussi dégradant et aussi brutal que l'esclavage des Noirs?

RÉPONSE - Tous les occultistes reconnaissent les besoins pressants de notre temps, personne n'attend avec plus d'impatience qu'eux le jour de la libération où l'amour fraternel sera effectif, où les nations "forgeront leurs épées en socs de charrue et leurs lances en faucilles", ainsi que l'a annoncé le prophète Esaïe, mais ils travaillent à réaliser ces conditions d'une manière différente. Les syndicats ouvriers et autres organismes cherchent à améliorer les conditions , mais l'occultiste maintient que leurs méthodes sont inopérantes et qu'elles échouent dans la réalisation permanente de leur objet, car il ne peut y avoir aucun doute que ce sont les hommes qui font les conditions, et non les conditions qui font les hommes. De sorte que si nous cherchons à améliorer les humains en élevant leur conception du bien et du mal et leurs idéaux, les hommes étant devenus meilleurs, les conditions s'amélioreront tout naturellement.

Dans les circonstances actuelles, dès que les syndicats ouvriers, par le moyen des grèves ou de la menace de grève, ont réussi à obtenir de meilleures conditions, le patron commence aussitôt à rechercher comment il pourra déjouer et faire échec à leurs plans. Pour se protéger, il s'associe avec d'autres patrons, si bien que les syndicats patronaux et ouvriers sont toujours en guerre. Les conditions meilleures obtenues par les uns sont continuellement changées par les autres. Mais lorsque patrons et ouvriers seront devenus de véritables Chrétiens, et auront appris à faire aux autres ce qu'ils voudraient qu'on leur fasse, il ne sera plus nécessaire d'avoir des syndicats ouvriers, car les patrons veilleront au bien-être de leurs employés et préviendront leurs besoins. L'occultiste sait que cet état de choses peut être amené à force d'y penser et de le vouloir, parce que tout ce qui existe, tout ce qui arrive, est le fruit de pensées antérieures dans l'intellect des hommes. Aussi prie-t-il ardemment que l'intellect des hommes puisse s'ouvrir à la réalité de la fraternité universelle, qu'ils puissent recevoir dans leur coeur l'amour de Dieu, et qu'ils s'unissent en cherchant à faire ce qui est juste, au lieu de faire séparément des plans pour opprimer et intimider autrui.

### <h3 id="question-183">Question 183</h3>

Quelqu'un peut-il étudier l'occultisme, vivre la vie supérieure et être millionnaire?

RÉPONSE - Le Christ a dit au jeune homme riche, "Va, vends tout ce que tu as", mais le jeune homme riche était très attaché aux bonnes choses de la vie, et il s'éloigna tristement. Le Christ fit alors remarquer combien il était difficile aux riches d'entrer dans le Royaume des cieux. Il n'a pas dit que la chose était impossible, mais il savait ce que les richesses renferment d'embûches et de tentations. Néanmoins, un homme peut être millionnaire et s'efforcer de vivre la vie supérieure. Les richesses nous enchaînent et nous entravent, mais il serait absolument erroné d'en déduire qu'elles empêchent tout développement occulte. Tout dépend de l'usage que l'homme se propose de faire de sa fortune. S'il l'emploie pour se donner de l'importance et pour opprimer son prochain, il ne peut évidemment y trouver des occasions de croissance spirituelle, mais s'il se considère comme l'intendant de sa fortune et qu'il construise, grâce à elle, des fabriques, des usines pourvues du matériel moderne, des habitations modèles, s'il travaille avec ardeur à la réalisation de ses idées philanthropiques afin d'améliorer la condition humaine et de donner aux autres toutes les chances de se développer par eux- mêmes, alors sa fortune représente un pouvoir énorme pour le bien. Lorsqu'un homme travaille ainsi généreusement au bien-être d'autrui, il n'a guère le temps de penser à son avancement personnel et sa croissance spirituelle sera inconsciente. Néanmoins, il fera d'énormes progrès, et les occasions de faire mieux et davantage se multiplieront dans cette vie et aussi dans ses vies futures. C'est là le véritable sens de la parabole des talents. Ceux qui avaient fait bon usage des leurs ont été nommés gouverneurs d'un certain nombre de cités, afin de leur donner un emploi approprié dans le plan de l'évolution spirituelle. Par contre, si un homme, possesseur d'une usine, se laisse dominer par le désir de se développer spirituellement, et vend égoïstement cette usine, privant ainsi ses ouvriers de travail, afin de développer ses propres pouvoirs et et de vivre la vie supérieure, un tel homme se dérobe à son devoir. Il n'est pas douteux qu'il sera blâmé par son Instructeur, car il aura enterré le talent qui lui avait été confié, et dans une vie suivante, il sera privé de l'occasion qu'il aura volontairement négligée.

### <h3 id="question-184">Question 184</h3>

Que pensez-vous de la peine capitale? N'est-elle pas préférable à la détention à vie, et plus clémente?

RÉPONSE - Chez les sauvages, la force prime le droit, "la raison du plus fort est toujours la meilleure". Nous nous enorgueillissons des progrès de notre civilisation, de l'altruisme apporté dans toutes les directions par nos gouvernements. Il n'est pas moins vrai que si nous n'allons pas de propos délibéré, l'arme au poing, assassiner des adversaires supposés, sauf en cas de guerre, nous les assassinons d'une manière raffinée au moyen de ce que nous appelons la loi. Il fut un temps où le voleur était pendu. Aujourd'hui, nous qualifions de barbare un tel châtiment, mais la peine capitale est encore une tache sur notre civilisation. De plus nous sommes beaucoup plus raffinés dans notre cruauté que les peuples appartenant à des civilisations anciennes, car ils pendaient ou décapitaient à bref délai, tandis que nous gardons les inculpés emprisonnés pendant des années, les soumettant à la torture d'un long jugement, fixons longtemps à l'avance le jour de leur exécution, les obligeant ainsi à souffrir mille morts par anticipation pendant tout le temps à courir.

Nous proclamons que nous n'usons pas de représailles, mais sous prétexte de sauvegarder la société et d'empêcher que les mêmes crimes ne se renouvellent, nous appliquons la peine capitale qui ne fait qu'inciter au meurtre. Lorsqu'un homme a des tendances homicides, il devrait être limité dans ses actions de manière à ne plus pouvoir blesser ses semblables. Mais le tuer ne le limite pas; la mort le rend libre dans le Monde du Désir, et comme le Monde du désir est tout autour de nous, il est parfaitement libre d'aller et venir parmi les gens, leur instillant des pensées de haine et de vengeance contre la société. C'est pourquoi le meurtre se multiplie. En outre, la folie homicide est entretenue par la presse. Les gros titres des journaux, le récit du crime dans tous ses détails, incitent autrui à faire de même. Si la presse passait sous silence les assassinats et les suicides, nous aurions bien moins de crimes; aussi est-ce avec satisfaction que nous constatons qu'il y a au moins quelques publications, comme celles de la Science Chrétienne, par exemple, qui se refusent à publier quoi que ce soit ne se rapportant pas au bien.

En ce qui concerne la seconde partie de la question, "La mort n'est-elle pas préférable à l'emprisonnement à vie?", nous répondrons, "Peut-être l'est-elle, dans les conditions actuelles du régime carcéral." Car cette branche de nos institutions appelle des réformes, et nous avons beaucoup à faire et à défaire en ce qui concerne le traitement de ceux que nous appelons des criminels. Ils sont nos frères, tout autant que certains soi-disant respectables membres de la société qui n'ont pas encore commis l'impardonnable crime d'être démasqués. Il est vrai que nous avons rendu la vie carcérale meilleure et moins barbare qu'elle ne l'était; que nous avons introduit la clause du sursis; que les condamnés peuvent en appeler à la cour de cassation; cependant, nous sommes encore loin de traiter d'une façon convenable ces frères plus faibles. Si nous pouvions vraiment comprendre qu'ils sont nos frères et les traiter comme nous traiterions un frère plus faible, fils de notre propre mère, nous agirions bien plus justement. En effet, qui parmi nous, si son propre frère avait fait le mal,l'enverrait en prison avec mépris, l'appellerait gibier de potence à sa libération, ou lui fermerait sa porte pour la vie à cause d'un moment de faiblesse? Lorsqu'une personne est malade de la fièvre typhoïde, nous ne nous mettons pas en colère contre elle, nous l'envoyons à l'hôpital jusqu'à ce qu'elle soit guérie; nous prenons soin d'elle, nous faisons tous nos efforts pour la rendre à la santé, et nous nous réjouissons lorsqu'elle est guérie. Un criminel est un faible, malade mentalement; il ne devrait pas être envoyé en prison, mais dans une institution où il pourrait apprendre à vaincre sa faiblesse. Ce n'est que lorsque nous traiterons nos frères plus faibles avec un soin affectueux que nous pourrons dire que nous nous sommes élevés au- dessus de la maxime barbare qui exigeait "oeil pour oeil, dent pour dent". Comment osons-nous prier "pardonne-nous nos offenses comme nous pardonnons à ceux qui nous ont offensés, alors que nous traitons ces pauvres frères comme nous le faisons maintenant encore?

### <h3 id="question-185">Question 185</h3>

Quel est le point de vue Rosicrucien sur le suffrage féminin?

RÉPONSE - L'esprit n'est ni masculin ni féminin, mais se manifeste alternativement comme homme et comme femme, si bien qu'en considérant le suffrage des femmes du point de vue le plus large, il serait à l'avantage des hommes de notre temps d'accorder aux femmes ce qui est réellement leur droit, c'est-à-dire une égalité pleine et entière, à tous égards. Le travail de la femme devrait être payé autant que celui de l'homme, et il serait bon de suivre, au moins dans les grandes lignes, les idées si admirablement exposées par Edward Bellamy dans son roman "Looking Backward" (Regards en arrière). 

L'opportunité de l'équitable arrangement social qui y est exposé est évidente si nous considérons que la présente existence terrestre est l'une de nos nombreuses vies sur terre, et que nous naissons alternativement homme et femme; mais il y a d'autres raisons pour lesquelles la femme devrait jouir de ce droit. Chez l'homme, le corps dense est positif, et il en résulte que ses forces positives sont particulièrement centrées dans la Région Chimique du Monde Physique. L'homme s'intéresse surtout à ce qu'il peut peser, mesurer, analyser, et travailler dans la vie quotidienne; son développement se fait particulièrement dans la direction matérielle, façonnant la terre, et tout ce qui la couvre, à sa fantaisie, mais prenant peu ou point d'intérêt au côté spirituel des choses.

La femme, au contraire, possède un corps vital positif et il en résulte qu'elle est intuitivement en contact avec les vibrations spirituelles de l'univers. Elle est plus idéaliste et imaginative, prenant un grand intérêt à toutes les choses qui tendent à l'élévation morale de la race humaine, et comme ce n'est que par la croissance morale et spirituelle que l'humanité peut progresser actuellement, la femme est vraiment le premier facteur de l'évolution. Ce serait un immense bienfait pour la race humaine si on lui accordait, en toutes choses, des droits égaux à ceux de l'homme. Tant que cela ne sera pas, nous ne pouvons espérer voir les réformes qui uniront vraiment l'humanité. Nous voyons cela, par analogie, si nous considérons le foyer où la femme est vraiment le pilier central, autour duquel se groupent le mari et les enfants. Selon sa capacité, elle fait le foyer ce qu'il est, elle est l'influence qui cimente, qui pacifie. Le père peut mourir ou quitter la maison, les enfants peuvent s'éloigner, tant que la mère reste au foyer, le foyer subsiste; mais que la mère soit enlevée par la mort, aussitôt le foyer est brisé

Certains diront, "D'accord, mais si la femme se consacre à la politique, son foyer sera tout aussi bien brisé". Or c'est là une chose qui n'est pas à craindre. Il se peut que, pendant la période de transition où la femme devra lutter pour acquérir ses droits, elle néglige plus ou moins son foyer, cela jusqu'à ce qu'elle se soit adaptée aux conditions nouvellement créées; mais dans les pays où ces conditions sont déjà établies, aucun foyer n'a été détruit, et il en est résulté beaucoup de bien, car les femmes sont toujours à l'avant-garde du progrès moral. Alors que les lois sont des expédients pour élever l'humanité à un plan supérieur, où chacun sera une loi en lui-même faisant ce qui est juste sans contrainte, il est néanmoins nécessaire, de nos jours, de réaliser légalement de telles réformes.

### <h3 id="question-186">Question 186</h3>

Si les occultistes s'abstiennent de manger de la viande à cause de la tragédie causée par la mort des animaux, tragédie à laquelle ils ne veulent prendre part en aucune façon, ni directement ni indirectement, n'est- ce pas aussi ôter la vie que de manger des oeufs, des fruits ou des légumes?

RÉPONSE - Le cas est bien différent, car alors qu'il est nécessaire de tuer l'animal pour en obtenir la chair, et par conséquent de le faire souffrir, nous portons réellement assistance à l'arbre dont nous cueillons les fruits, comme il est facile de le voir si nous comprenons le processus de germination.

Le processus est le même avec les animaux comme avec les êtres humains, et en fait dans tous les règnes. Lorsqu'un animal va naître, l'esprit-groupe, aidé par les esprits de la nature et par les anges, façonne son corps vital qui est ensuite déposé dans la matrice de la mère, tandis que les atomes-germes sont placés dans le fluide séminal du père; ensuite la gestation a lieu, et l'animal vient au monde. Sans la présence de l'atome-germe et de la matrice du corps vital, aucun corps physique animal ne peut se former. Les mêmes conditions gouvernent la fécondation de l'oeuf ou celle de la graine.Elles sont comme les ovules de la femelle, toutes représentant autant d'occasions. Si un oeuf est placé dans un incubateur ou couvé par une poule, l'esprit- groupe envoie la vie requise, acceptant l'occasion ainsi offerte. Si une graine est mise en terre, elle est aussi fertilisée lorsque les conditions qu'exige son développement sont réunies, mais pas avant. Quand un oeuf est écrasé, cuit ou transformé de quelque autre manière, ce qui l'écarte de sa destination première, ou lorsqu'une graine a été emmagasinée, pendant des années peut-être, il n'y a pas de vie, et par conséquent, il n'y a aucun mal à utiliser ces produits comme nourriture. Il est même profitable aux plantes de leur enlever leurs fruits, parce que ceux-ci cessent alors d'absorber inutilement la sève de l'arbre.

### <h3 id="question-187">Question 187</h3>

La terrible entité vue par Glyndon dans le "Zanoni" de Bulwer Lytton est-elle la même que celle dont parle Robert L. Stevenson dans son histoire de M. Hyde?

RÉPONSE - Non. Bien qu'il y ait quelque ressemblance à certains égards, il existe une grande différence sur d'autres points. La terrible entité vue par Glyndon est connue en occultisme sous le nom de "Gardien du Seuil". Lorsque le néophyte entre consciemment dans le Monde du Désir, après avoir quitté son corps physique endormi, il doit passer une entité telle celle décrite par Glyndon. Cette entité est l'incarnation de toutes les mauvaises actions du passé, qui n'ont pas encore été expiées et qui attendent d'être effacées dans des vies futures. Le néophyte doit admettre cette entité comme faisant partie de lui-même et la reconnaître en tant que telle. Il doit se promettre à lui- même de liquider aussitôt que possible toutes les dettes représentées par cette forme terrible.

Cette entité n'est même pas apparente à l'homme ordinaire pendant l'intervalle entre la mort et une nouvelle naissance, bien qu'elle soit toujours présente. C'est un démon qui a pour compensation une autre forme représentant tout le bien qu'un homme a fait dans le passé, et qu'on peut appeler son ange gardien; mais ces formes jumelles sont, comme nous l'avons dit, invisibles en tout temps à l'homme ordinaire, bien que puissantes à jamais dans sa vie.

Il arrive quelquefois, cependant, qu'à la mort un individu passe dans l'au- delà avec une nature-désir tellement forte qu'après avoir expié au Purgatoire les actions qu'elle contenait et être entré au Deuxième Ciel, cette coque se conserve et dure jusqu'à ce que l'individu renaisse. Cette coque est alors attirée vers lui par une force magnétique et il possède, pour ainsi dire, un corps du désir double. Le corps du désir de la vie passée peut alors se faire sentir à certains moments, et lui faire mener une vie double comme celle du "docteur Jekyll" que son double, "M. Hyde" - ainsi que l'a raconté R.L. Stevenson - pousse à des actes qu'il abhorre, car la souffrance engendrée en expiant ceux-ci au Purgatoire agit en tant que conscience qui lui fait éprouver de la répulsion pour le mal. Heureusement, de tels cas sont extrêmement rares de nos jours.

### <h3 id="question-188">Question 188</h3>

Si le bras d'une personne est amputé, une branche d'arbre coupée, une partie de falaise dynamitée, la contrepartie invisible de ces différentes choses sera-t-elle enlevée aussi?

RÉPONSE - Dans le cas d'un bras amputé, la contrepartie éthérique de ce bras restera encore avec le corps vital, bien qu'il existe un certain lien magnétique entre le bras physique enterré et le bras éthérique. On cite le cas d'un homme qui se plaignait de vives douleurs comme si quelque objet était en train de percer la chair de son bras amputé. Ces douleurs persistèrent pendant plusieurs semaines, si bien qu'à la fin le bras fut exhumé; on découvrit qu'en clouant la boîte, un des clous avait été enfoncé dans la chair, à l'endroit où l'homme ressentait ces douleurs, lesquelles cessèrent dès que le clou eut été enlevé. Les personnes ayant eu un bras ou un membre amputé se plaignent parfois, pendant quelques années après l'opération, de douleurs dans ce membre, puis les douleurs cessent, parce que le bras éthérique s'est désagrégé en même temps que le membre physique enterré.

Le corps vital de la plante n'est composé que des deux éthers les plus denses - l'éther chimique et l'éther vital - qui rendent la plante capable de croître et de se multiplier, mais les deux éthers supérieurs, l'éther-lumière et l'éther réflecteur, lui manquent; la plante n'a donc ni la sensation, ni la mémoire de ce qui se passe autour d'elle. Par conséquent, le fait de couper une branche n'est pas ressenti par l'arbre. Et dans le cas d'une falaise dynamitée, seul l'éther chimique est présent, de sorte que les cristaux n'auront pas de sentiments du tout. On aurait tort toutefois d'en déduire qu'il n'y a pas de sentiment dans aucun de ces cas, car bien que les plantes et les minéraux n'aient aucun moyen individuel de ressentir, ils sont enveloppés et interpénétrés par les éthers et le Monde de Désir de notre planète, ainsi l'Esprit Planétaire ressent toute chose, selon le même principe qui fait que notre doigt, qui n'a pas de corps du désir individuel, ne peut ressentir, mais nous, les esprits intérieurs habitant le corps dense, ressentons toute blessure faite au doigt.

### <h3 id="question-189">Question 189</h3>

Connaissez-vous un lieu, un foyer, une retraite où l'on puisse vivre cette vie belle, simple et inoffensive que vous préconisez?

RÉPONSE - Non, nous n'en connaissons pas, et si un tel foyer était fondé dans ce but, nous plaindrions vivement ceux qui l'habiteraient. Si, ayant un caractère emporté, nous allons dans la montagne vivre en reclus, là où il n'y a personne pour mettre nos nerfs à l'épreuve, nous aurons bien peu de mérite à rester calmes et tranquilles. Si nous trouvons difficile de triompher de nos vices ou de nos défauts au milieu des villes, et que nous allions dans un lieu désert où ces tentations n'existent pas, nous avons peu de mérite de ne pas céder à la tentation? Nous avons été placés dans des villes et parmi nos semblables afin de nous habituer à eux, de concilier ce qui doit l'être entre eux et nous, et apprendre à retenir nos accès de colère en dépit de notre exaspération, apprendre à éviter la tentation là où elle est. Nous pouvons aller dans le désert et laisser notre coeur à la ville, ou nous emmurer dans un monastère et soupirer encore après les plaisirs du monde. Il est mieux de rester là où nous nous trouvons et de développer à cet endroit les qualités spirituelles qui feront de nous de meilleurs hommes et de meilleures femmes. Il y a du travail à faire dans le monde, et si nous fuyons le monde, how shall we do it? We have a responsibility to our fellowmen. unless we discharge that responsibility we are shirking our duty, and fate will bring us back in such an environment that we cannot escape. Therefore, it is better to aim to learn all the lessons that are at our hands instead of running away from them.
