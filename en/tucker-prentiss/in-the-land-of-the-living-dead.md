IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

CHAPTER I 

A VISIT TO THE INVISIBLE PLANES 

IT ALL came about from a German high-explosive 
shell. 

Nothing happens without a cause. We might say 
that this story began in Germany when Gretchen Ham- 
merstein put the finishing touches on a certain high- 
explosive shell and with the contact of her fingers 
filled the shell with the vibrations of her hatred for 
the Americans. We might note the various oc 
currences which, each the result of an endless train of 
circumstances, contributed to the fact that this par 
ticular shell was brought to the German front at just 
such a time and just such a place. But to follow up 
these lines of happenings, almost infinite in number, 
would require an infinitude of patience. 

So we will take up the history of events when this 
high-explosive shell burst in the American trenches, 
scattering, besides its material and visible charge and 
fragments, the hatred for Americans which Gretchen 
Hammerstein had packed into it. 

Jimmie Westman was leaning against the trench 
wall nearest the German line and was peering through 
the well camouflaged peephole which was used to

:6: IN THE 


LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 


watch the dreary and awful wastes of No Man 's Land 
in guarding against any surprise attack. The shell 
burst within a few feet of him and to the rear, but 
Jimmie did not know it. It was, in fact, a long time 
before he found out just what had happened, and it 
is of the things which came in between the bursting 
of the shell and the time when Jimmie was able to 
reconstruct the whole affair, that I wish to tell. They 
were quite remarkable events; they produced a great 
impression upon Jimmie and completely changed his 
ideas of life. 

It was, as I have said, a long time before Jimmie 
regained consciousness after the explosion. To be 
exact it was practically three days, and while he is 
lying in that condition of coma let us take a little look 
into his life and history. 

Jimmie was not born of poor but honest parents. 
His parents were honest but not poor, and though not 
rich they had given him a good up-bringing and a 
good education. He had gone through high school 
and was engaged in the study of medicine when the 
war broke out. I say he was engaged in it. I like 
Jimmie and am reluctant to say that he was putting 
far more of his time into the sports of the gridiron 
and the diamond than he should have done, but, nev 
ertheless, that was the case. He was a specimen of 
the clean, honorable, somewhat careless American boy, 
eager to succeed, eager to stand high in work and 


A VISIT TO THE INVISIBLE PLANES 7 

sport alike, but glamoured to a certain extent by the 
adulation paid to the prominent athletes in the col 
lege which he attended. 

However, he was engaged in the study of medicine, 
partially engaged, perhaps I should add, and he was 
really deeply interested in his chosen profession al 
though he had not progressed so far as to be very pro 
found in his knowledge of materia medica. He had 
imbibed some of the scientific spirit of the lecturers 
to whom he had listened, and his mind had taken on 
a rather skeptical tinge which had given his mother 
some little worry; still not very much for well she 
knew that her early teachings were deeply rooted, and 
the character of her boy ,was too strong for the sci 
entific skepticism of his surroundings to do much 
more than ruffle the surface of his clean young life. 

But Jimmie had an inquiring soul, and while the 
platitudes, most of them grossly illogical and unscien 
tific, which he heard from the pulpit when he did go 
to church, produced little effect upon him, yet the ob 
jections put forward by the doctors and students with 
whom he was associated seemed to him to be also lack 
ing in force and weak in reason. He was swayed be 
tween the two but controlled by neither, though at 
heart he was inclined to be deeply religious as most 
people are if they have the chance. 

In the first year of his college life the great war 
began. It was practically at the end of the first year 


8 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

just before the final examinations, and when he went 
home for the summer vacation the whole country 
was seething. Farsighted ones knew that the war 
would involve the United States. Fanatics and fanat 
ical pacifists fought every measure of safety and sided 
with the traitors and the enemies of liberty and just 
ice. Jimmie began to think and turned over and over 
in his mind the state of the world, and when he went 
back to his study in the fall it was with the settled 
conviction that the United States would soon have to 
enter and that he would necessarily be involved. At 
that time no one had foreseen the shortage of doctors, 
and Jimmie, feeling sure that the fight was a righteous 
one and that it was his duty to help even though his 
country still held back, during the second year of his 
medical course enlisted with the Canadians. He 
paid a short visit home first and succeeded in making 
his mother and father see the matter in his way, 
though it was the hardest task he had ever attempted. 

It was when he was home on this errand that he 
got the news of the death of an old friend of his. She 
had grown up with him and the loss of her dispelled 
a dream which had half formed in his mind and 
toward the realization of which he had unconsciously 
been working. 

So he enlisted and was whirled into the great seeth 
ing cauldron of war. 

By the time the United States came in, he was a war 


A VISIT TO THE INVISIBLE PLANES 9 

worn veteran of wide experience in spite of his youth, 
and he sought and obtained a transfer from the 
Canadian troops to those of his own country by whom 
he was welcomed with enthusiasm. At the time the 
shell burst which made so great a change in his life 
he was second lieutenant with a good chance of pro 
motion. 

He had not heard the shell, and as I have said did 
not know that it had exploded, so was somewhat sur 
prised to find himself in a part of the country which 
he did not know. It was a wide, meadow-like stretch 
of land sloping gently upward and he was walking 
leisurely along as though he had all the time there was 
at his disposal. 

The first return of consciousness found him walk 
ing up this gentle slope, wandering a little in his mind 
because, as he remembered it, he should have been 
at his post in the trench. Things were a little differ 
ent somehow, but just how, he could not for the life 
of him understand. 

He seemed to be moving with considerable ease, 
much more than he was accustomed to, for the ever 
lasting mud of this country did stick to one's boots 
terribly and it was often hard work to place one foot 
before the other. Now, however, he was stepping along 
easily and without effort, but he did not know where 
he was going, or where he came from. 

The trench was not in sight but he was walking1 so 


10 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

entirely without effort that it made little difference 
to him, for he could find it, doubtless, even though his 
knowledge of French was quite limited. 

Thank goodness ! he was not behind the enemy lines. 

But stop ! 

If he were behind his own lines and did not know 
how he got there, why might he not be behind the 
enemy lines equally without his knowledge ? 

His mind was coming back to him more and more. 
It was as if he had awakened from a deep sleep and 
was just coming to himself. 

But if he had been asleep, why did not some of the 
boys come and wake him up before the whole line had 
been pushed forward like this ? 

For goodness sake! where was the trench? Where 
was the camp, the communication trenches, the roads, 
everything? Where was this place, this nice, easy 
meadow sloping gently upwards? 

The line must have gone forward and he had been 
left behind in his sleep. That was evidently so, be 
cause if the line had gone backwards, the bosches 
would have waked him up with their pleasant "civil 
ized" custom of killing the wounded and the sleep 
ing, if there were any sleeping. No, the line had gone 
forward and somehow he had not waked up but had 
evidently walked in his sleep to this place, wherever 
this place might be. 

He could not remember leaving the firing post 


A VISIT TO THE INVISIBLE PLANES 11 

where he had been watching through the peephole, but 
that was a mere detail. The main thing now was to 
find out where the command was and rejoin it. He 
could easily find it because he knew how to keep his 
direction by the sun. 

Involuntarily he looked up. The sun was not visible, 
although it was broad daylight and there was no haze 
apparent. 

Never before in France had he seen so long a stretch 
of country with no signs of humanity. Either there 
were towns and hamlets and farms or there was the 
awful desolation where the bosches had passed, but 
this meadow showed neither the one nor the other. 
It was certainly an enormous meadow, especially for 
France. Put a number of tractors on this place and 
the dread of famine would pass away for there was 
land enough here to raise food for a kingdom. 

But time was passing and he must hurry ; also he 
must think of some kind of excuse for his absence, for 
the captain was pretty strict on such subjects and 
sleep-walking might not be taken as a valid reason for 
being away from his post of duty. 

"Why don't you glide?19 

1 ' What do you mean by * glide T' 

He turned to see who spoke, for he had heard no 
footsteps and had thought he was quite alone. He 
saw a girl walking along beside him or, at least, mov 
ing along beside him, for apparently she was not walk- 


12 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

ing the conventional way. He knew her well, and a? he 
recognized her he felt his face grow pale, for the girl 
beside him was one who had been a particular friend 
of his. But he had been told on his last visit home 
that she had — had — well, that she had died while he 
was away at college and just before his return to say 
good-bye to his parents previous to enlisting. He must 
have been misinformed, somehow. He looked at her, 
edged away just a trifle, pinched himself, and was 
quite at a loss just what to do or say. It must be that 
she had not died but perhaps she had been sent to an 
insane asylum and had gotten over here to France 
somehow by mistake; and here she was talking non 
sense to him about "gliding". 

He glanced at her again. By jove, she was gliding! 
For heaven 's sake ! Had he gone crazy too t 

A merry peal of laughter interrupted his amaze 
ment. It was the old, joyous, hearty laugh of the girl 
he had known so well. 

By jiminy! she was laughing at him. Bewildered? 
Well, who wouldn't be bewildered in such a case? 

Thoughts flash through the mind at times with ter 
rific rapidity, and the thoughts which I am setting 
down apparently took a long time to occur, but in re 
ality they were almost instantaneous and practically 
took no time at all; yet they had a logical sequence 


A VISIT TO THE INVISIBLE PLANES 13 

and seemed to him at the time to be slow and careful 
reasoning. 

She was laughing at him ! Ghosts don 't laugh. It 
is not — not — well, it simply is not done, that's all. 
Everybody knows that ghosts don't laugh. And she 
was talking to him about gliding. That showed that 
she was crazy and upheld the insane asylum theory 
but, and here he glanced again at her feet — she really 
was gliding. At least she was not walking by lifting 
up one foot and putting it down again in front of the 
other. No she was gliding and laughing at him. 

Besides, ghosts are gloomy, distraught, lovers of 
darkness and graveyards and midnight and mystery 
and of frightening people. Yet here was one, if she 
really were a ghost, who was looking at him with a 
really beautiful face, happy, apparently joyous, and 
frankly and unaffectedly amused at him, — at him! 

He remembered her well. He had known her well. 
He had been — er — well to tell the truth — he had 
thought that perhaps when he got started in his pro 
fession — oh ! shucks, he must be dreaming. He was in 
France, had come over to fight the Kaiser and to make 
the world safe for democracy, and that was a serious 
job. 

Yet here she was laughing at him. How could 
such a mistake have occurred? They had told him all 
about it. They had gone over it again and again for 
they knew how he had — cared for her. Yet they 


14 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

must have made a mistake. He had to believe the 
evidence of his own eyes. 

Dear heart, but she was pretty now ! She had been 
pretty before, beautiful, he had thought, but now she 
seemed radiant. Now she was walking and with that 
little dancing step which cannot be described but is 
called "tripping." 

She moved slightly ahead and half turned toward 
him, laughing at him in such a natural way, just like 
her own old self, that he began to laugh too. Things 
had seemed pretty serious, but with so much merri 
ment around and such a pretty girl mocking him he 
could not realize that the Huns were so near and that 
so much human suffering was going on. 

She instantly grew serious as though she had di 
vined his thought. 

"I couldn't help it, Jimmie, you looked so bewil 
dered." 

"I surely am bewildered. How did you get here, 
over here in France? And why did they tell me that 
you had — er — gone — ' ' he groped helplessly for a way 
to express the thought. 

She answered him with a rippling little laugh at 
his dilemma. 

"Don't be afraid to say it, Jimmie." 

He was "afraid to say it" however and he count 
ered with — 

' ' How did you get here ? ' ' 


A VISIT TO THE INVISIBLE PLANES 15 

' ' I was sent. ' ' 

"Look here, Marjorie, don't fool me. How did you 
get over here in France?" 

"Truly, Jimmie, I am not 'fooling'; honest Injun, 
as we used to say, I was sent, really and truly I was, 
but I asked to be sent, ' ' she added. * * You see the oth 
ers were so busy and there was not much that I could 
do, but I knew that I could help you and I knew that 
you would be glad to see me, so I asked for permission 
and the Elder Brother gave it to me ; he is always so 
kind to me." 

The insane asylum theory received a new impetus 
with this statement. The "Elder Brother" must be 
one of the doctors, but she didn't talk like an insane 
person. She was radiantly beautiful now, far more 
beautiful than she had been when he had seen her last, 
and she was talking rationally, but who in the dickens 
was this "Elder Brother"? She was an only child. 
It must be the doctor. 

He had been through an insane asylum once with 
a party of sight-seers and had not noticed that any 
of the women inmates were beautiful. Even if one 
of them had been pretty, the expression of the eyes 
would have offset any mere physical prettiness. But 
this dancing, gliding, tripping girl beside him, with 
her blue eyes and fair hair, was so bewilderingly, daz- 
zlingly beautiful, and her eyes had not a trace of that 


16 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

fixed stare or lack of focus which makes the insane 
person so terrible to look at. 

And, besides, she could glide! Great Scott! He 
had forgotten that. She could glidel How in the 
dickens could any one glide f It just can't be done, 
except on skates — 

"Oh yes, it can! You can do it yourself!" 

"Me! How did you know what I was thinking 
of?" 

' ' Why, I can tell from your aura. ' ' 

"My— what?" 

"Aura. Your aura ! Don't you know you have an 
aura?" 

"Never heard of it before. I got a medal for 
sharpshooting, but they didn't give me any aura and 
I know I didn 't bring one over with nte. ' ' 

She danced around in front of him as he walked, 
gliding, tripping, and looking tantalizingly at him 
first from one side and then from the other, and all 
the time laughing at him with that thrilling, tinkling 
laugh of hers, so full of merriment and fun. She 
was laughing so that she could not speak for some mo 
ments. He did not understand what the joke was, 
but it was evidently a good one and she was so happy 
over it and so pretty that he reached out and took 
her hand and they danced along together, laughing, 
she at him and he at himself, for the joke he could not 
understand. 


A VISIT TO THE INVISIBLE PLANES 17 

1 ' % Jove ! He had forgotten ! 

By all the rules he ought to be worn out. Sin^ce 
the big bombardment had commenced several days 
ago he had not known what it was not to be tired ; yet 
here he was, dancing along with this pretty girl just 
as though he was as fresh as a daisy. Ah! He felt 
tired now, dreadfully tired; it just showed the force 
of mind over matter that he had forgotten his weari 
ness for an instant in the joy of this new-found 
friendship. He could hardly drag one foot after 
the other. 

She drew her hand away with that old, familiar ex 
pression of pretense at anger. 

" You 're not tired, either! You just think you 
are. Now make up your mind that you 're not tired ! ' ' 

"I can't Marjorie! I'm awfully tired. Why I 
haven't had any sleep for two nights, and tramping 
around in that mud and all — why — Marjorie, a fellow 
can't do that for three days and not be tired." 

"Now, Jimmie, don't you know you didn't feel at 
all tired at first ? When we were walking along and 
you were wondering how I came to be here, you were 
not tired at all because you were not thinking of it, 
and now just because you think you ought to be tired 
you go and get tired. Let 's sit down awhile. ' ' 

"It's too damp here for you to be sitting on the 
ground; you'd catch your death of cold." 

She laughed at him. 

2 


18 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

1 'No, I won't catch my death of cold. It's quite 
dry here. See how dry the ground is. Besides I 
can't catch my death of cold. There are reasons. 
That's what I came to tell you about, but I don't 
know how to begin, Jimmie." 

He looked at the ground. It really was perfectly 
dry, just as she had said. 

' i Well, let 's sit down, then. But remember I 've got 
to hurry back and report and so I can't stop but a 
minute or two. But what did you come to tell me 
about? And why can't you tell it? I never knew 
you to be unable to hold up your end of the conver 
sation, Marjorie. What is it you want to tell me?" 

"Oh, Jimmie! It's hard to tell you. You won't 
believe me. ' ' 

"Yes, I will, Marjorie. I'll believe anything you 
say. But there are some mighty queer things hap 
pening this morning that I don't understand at all. 
Now, how did you come here ? ' ' 

"Just as I told you. I was sent. But I asked to 
be sent because I wanted to help you. And now I 
don 't know how to say it. ' ' 

"Who sent you, Marjorie?" 

"The Elder Brother. Oh, he is so kind and good 
to me." 

' ' Who is this ' Elder Brother '—a doctor ? ' ' 

She smiled, a little sadly but very sweetly. 

"Do you remember what you thought first when I 


A VISIT TO THE INVISIBLE PLANES 19 

spoke to you and you looked around and saw who it 
was?'' 

"Yes. I remember what I thought — but — but — you 
don 't know what I had been told. ' ' 

' ' Oh, yes I do, for I was there when you were told, 
and T saw you turn around and swallow something in 
your throat and I know you were told I was — was — 
dead." 

"Yes. That's just what I was told, and I believed 
it because everybody said it and they took me out and 
showed me the — the — grave and — and — " 

"Yes, Jimmie dear, I know all about it for I was 
there and heard it all, and I saw how you went outi 
that night, way out into the country and into that old 
lane in which we used to walk, and how you cried and 
cried when you thought no one knew. Yes, I know 
all about it, Jimmie, for I was there. ' ' 

"You!— there !" 

"Yes, Jimmie, my dear friend, my dear, dear 
friend. I was there and I saw your grief and I put 
my arms around you and tried to comfort you. I was 
there, for it was true — what they told you — it was 
true." 

"You were — you are — ?" 

"Yes, dear friend, I was dead. There! I might 
as well say it." She smiled through the tears for she 
was frankly crying now. 

"I might as well use the hateful word. It has to 


20 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

be used though it is untrue — untrue, Jimmie. We 
never die. Neither you nor I are dead. No ! We are both 
more alive than we ever were before for we are one 
step nearer the great Source of all life and love, and 
I know it is true for the Elder Brother told me. He 
is so great and good and he knows everything, Jimmie, 
and he knows you and all about you and he loves you 
too, Jimmie. I knew I could help you, and I have 
permission to tell you more than is told most of the 
soldiers because you are able to bear more than most 
of them. I know that you will believe what I tell you 
because it is what the Elder Brother has told me. 
And, oh ! Jimmie dear, it is nothing to worry about for 
now you will be able to do so much more work when 
you have learned about the war and the other things 
and about the Master. " 

She spoke now with almost a whisper and with awe 
making her beautiful face even more lovely than it 
had been. 

"You will learn about the Master and how we can 
work for Him and maybe, maybe if you work hard 
for Him, Jimmie, some day you will see Him. I saw 
Him once," she added proudly; "I saw Him once at 
a distance. I think He looked at me and I felt so 
happy that I just danced and sang for a long time. 
But that was before they had let me do any of the war 
work that is going on here. They told me at first that 
the conditions were too terrible for me to try to help 


A VISIT TO THE INVISIBLE PLANES 21 

until I got stronger, but since then they have let me 
help a little, especially with the children. I do love 
to take the little ones when they first come over, so 
terrified and so frantic, and soothe them to sleep and 
work with them; until they realize that they are sur 
rounded with love over on this side and not with that 
awful hate which has so filled poor Belgium. I feel 
so sorry for the dear little mites. I have helped in 
this way a good deal lately. ' ' 

Jimmie had not known what an aura was when the 
thing was mentioned but now he saw Marjorie sur 
rounded with a glowing cloud, a radiating light of 
which she seemed unconscious but of which she was 
the center. It made her far more beautiful than she 
had been, and Jimmie shrank back a little, feeling un 
worthy to be so near one of God 's own saints. 

"Since I began this work I haven't danced much" 
Marjorie continued, "not nearly as much as I have 
today, for I am so glad to see you and to be allowed 
to come and help you. It is the first time they have 
allowed me to meet any of the soldiers who have come 
over for it is a dangerous thing sometimes. It needs 
great strength and wisdom and I have neither, but I 
have one thing that counts for more, far more. ' ' She 
turned away and whispered the words to herself; 
Jimmie was not sure but he thought the words were 
—"I have love." 


22 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

"Oh, Marjorie! Do you mean that I am — what we 
just now said?" 

"Yes, you are, Jimmie, but don't let it worry you 
for it is really an advantage. There are lots of reasons 
why it is a great thing to be here and I am going to 
tell you some of them. But you are lucky for the 
Elder Brother is coming to meet you." 

' * I don 't want to meet any Elder Brothers. I want 
to talk to you. ' ' 

He reached out and took her hand. 

"If I am dead then you are too and so neither of 
us has any advantage. I'm sure you don't look dead 
a bit and I don't feel dead. I can't make head or 
tail of it." 


CHAPTER II 

A SERGEANT 's EXPERIENCE 

JIMMIE, the Elder Brother is coming! Oh! 
Oh ! I 'm so glad for it must be that he wants 
to talk to you himself. ' ' 

"Well, I wish he'd stay away. I want to talk to 
you—" 

"Here he is—" 

Jimmie turned in response to a gesture from Mar- 
jorie and saw standing before him a man, somewhat 
past middle age, tall, erect, and with nothing so prom 
inent about him as the ability to inspire in others the 
feeling of being in the immediate presence of great 
power. The man bowed slightly and while Marjorie 
and Jimmie were rising, spoke: 

"I know you very well, Mr. Westman, especially 
through the help of our little friend here," and he 
touched Marjorie 's curls gently and lovingly. "I sent 
her to meet yeu first but must not tax her too greatly. 
I want you to come with me for a while, and later you 
may have a long talk with her." 

The newcomer's manner and tone bore such an air 
of quiet authority that Jimmie never for an instant 
entertained a thought of appeal. He merely re 
sponded to Marjorie 's little graceful gesture of adieu 

23 


24 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

and turned to walk beside the man whom. Marjorie 
had called the " Elder Brother." 

They walked for some distance in silence, a silence 
which Jimmie thought it best not to break, for in some 
way which he could not explain, he felt as though 
this man was quite a "big bug" in this country, and 
so he walked on silently until the man himself might 
feel moved to begin the conversation. 

Some rods had been passed in slow pacing before 
the silence was broken. In the meantime Jimmie had 
cast a furtive glance around to see how far Marjorie 
had gone, but to his surprise she was not in sight ajt 
all although he was sure he could see a couple of miles 
in any direction. 

"You have had a good rest," his companion said at 
length, "and it will not be too great a tax upon you 
to map out briefly some of the duties which it will be 
your privilege to attend to in this new life upon which 
you have entered. But before that I will show you a 
little of what has happened and is happening, and as 
soon as you are ready for the inform ation I shall show 
you just why this war was allowed to come upon the 
world and in just what manner your help will be 
needed. 

' ' Things are somewhat different here from what 
you have been accustomed to, and I want to call your 
attention to one thing which Marjorie hesitated to 
dwell upon and that is the method of your locomo- 


A SERGEANT'S EXPERIENCE 25 

tion. You do not need to walk in the old way; it is 
much more convenient and much quicker to progress 
by what Marjorie suggested to you at first — the 
glide. We all of us here move that way. It only re 
quires a slight effort of the will and is as much su 
perior to walking as walking is to crawling on the 
hands and knees. In fact there is hardly a limit to 
the speed of the glide and without it we would find 
it impossible to do the work which has to be done 
in these strenuous times. Try it." 

At the word he began to glide just as Jimmie had 
seen Marjorie do. Jimmie then made the effort him 
self and to his surprise found that he could move along 
as he had often done on ice when skating, only this 
movement was the result of an effort of the will and 
required no exertion of the body at all. He was as 
delighted as a child with this newly acquired power 
and glided around like an ice skater cutting the old 
familiar figure eight and other patterns a number 
of times before he once more steadied down at the side 
of his new acquaintance. 

There is a great deal of the boy in every man just 
as there is a great deal of the man in every boy, and 
iJimmie was frankly more absorbed and interested in 
the possibilities of the glide and in the fact that he had 
resumed his place at the Elder Brother's side without 
being in the least out of breath or feeling any of the 
effects which usually follow such strenuous exercise, 


2G IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

than he was in the tremendous fact that he had really 
and truly crossed over the " Great Divide " and was 
in the very act and article of learning what was on the 
"Other Side of Death." 

Slowing down to the more dignified progress of his 
guide, he felt somewhat abashed at his exhibition of 
enthusiasm and began to apologize in an indirect man 
ner. 

* ' This gliding business is quite a novelty to me and 
it seems to be just what I have always wanted to do. 
I've dreamed of just that very thing at times, and 
when I once realized that I could actually glide, it 
was like doing some old, familiar stunt over again." 

"You were not mistaken. It is an old familiar 
'stunt.' " 

"It must be that my ice skating is what made it 
seem natural to me." 

"No. It was familiar because you have often 
glided and you were really used to doing it. In 
your sleep you have always spent your time over on 
this side. On most nights you were not actually con 
scious, yet you were partially aware of what you were 
doing though you were not able to take the memory 
back with you. ' ' 

* * Gee ! Well, what do you know about that ! ' ' 

"It's an improvement on walking, isn't it?" 

1 ' Well ! I should say so. I '11 sure teach it to the 
boys when I go back — " 


A SERGEANT'S EXPERIENCE 27 

He stopped short, realizing that there was no ' ' go 
ing back." 

The man's face glowed with sympathy. 

' * No, ' ' he said, ' ' there is no going back, but I think 
that when I have shown you that which lies before 
you and which is so much grander and greater than 
what lies back of us, you will not want to go back, 
you will want with all your heart and soul to 
go forward." 

"I am going to take you back to the trench where 
your company is, for one of your friends is going to 
pass over. As he will not go in the same way you 
did he will recover consciousness almost immediately 
and I want you to take charge of him. In this way 
you will learn a good deal about some phases of what 
your duties will be later on. " 

"And now," he continued, "before you begin ac 
tual work, I want to impress upon your mind that this 
war was necessary, because in no other way could the 
human race be saved from an impending and over 
whelming fate. This fact does not in the least ex 
cuse those who are responsible for bringing it on, but 
I speak of it because the great conflict and awful suf 
fering have made some think that the powers of good 
were helpless before the powers of evil. This is not 
so. God rules over all and as the sparrow cannot fall 
without His knowledge and will, so no war can be 
started without His knowledge and will ; but, as said, 


28 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

this does not excuse those who bring it on. ' ' His face 
grew very stern but withal tender, and his eyes had 
a far-away look in them as though his thoughts were 
far away over the centuries that are to come before 
the good which is to result from the great struggle 
shall have formed its pattern on the loom of time. 

"Now," he resumed, "we will travel a little faster 
and you can use that newly found power of yours, 
the glide." 

He began to glide as he spoke and moved faster 
and faster. Jimmie kept gliding along by his side, 
occasionally forgetting and fixing his mind on some 
thing else, and when he did this he found that he was 
apt to stop altogether. This he explained to himself 
by saying that walking had become so much a sec 
ond nature to him that he could do it and still think 
of something else, but that gliding was yet new and so 
he had to center his mind on it all the time. 

The Elder Brother moved faster and Jimmie fol 
lowed him as well as he could, though when the guide 
left the earth and moved through the air Jimmie was 
a little dubious as to his ability to follow so strenuous 
a leader. Soon, however, he became more and more 
accustomed to the new sensation and began to take a 
little interest in the landscape. Now he noticed that 
they were passing over a part of the country which 
was familiar to him, and in another moment or two 
he saw that they were nearing the trenches. He heard 


A SERGEANT'S EXPERIENCE 29 

the reports of the great guns and saw the planes fly 
ing far above, for he and his guide were again near- 
ing the earth, and in another minute they had alighted 
on the edge of that section of the trench where his 
firing post had been. 

There it was yet with one of the men of the company 
in it, and Jimmie motioned to his friend that they had 
better jump down into the trench where they would 
be safe. It was not until the Elder Brother smiled 
at him in a quizzical way that he remembered the fact 
that the danger of bullets was over for him, that they 
could pass through his present ethereal body without 
causing discomfort. 

The Elder Brother laid a hand on Jimmie 's arm 
and pointed to a man somewhat over forty, in the 
uniform of a sergeant, who was sitting quietly in a 
little dugout smoking a cigarette and looking at an 
old magazine. As they were looking he threw away 
the stub of the cigarette, laid down the magazine, rose 
slowly, and stepped into the trench. He walked leis 
urely to the firing post, raised his head to look through 
the little opening, and was neatly drilled through the 
forehead with a rifle bullet. He stood still for a mo 
ment, then as the muscles lost their vitality they 
slowly relaxed, and the body as slowly leaned against 
the wall of trench, quietly sinking down. That 
was what the horrified rifleman on duty saw, but what 
Jimmie saw was that the sergeant quietly stepped out 


30 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

of his body and stood there, looking at the rifleman 
with a puzzled expression on his face. Jimmy needed 
no guide to tell him what had happened, and he 
called to Sergeant Strew who looked up at him and 
said quietly: 

''Hello, Jimmie, glad to see you. When did you 
blow in? I heard you'd 'gone west.' " 

' * Hello, old fellow, ' ' said Jimmie, ' ' I just came out 
and brought a friend of mine." 

He turned to the Elder Brother and said : 

"I'd introduce you to my friend, Sergeant Strew, 
sir, if I knew your name. ' ' 

Sergeant Strew seemed to evince no great surprise 
that Jimmie should have come out to the firing line 
in such a manner, bringing a friend with him as 
though the front trench were a visiting place, nor did 
the unusual circumstance strike either of them as at 
all out of the ordinary. It is often thus with those who 
have recently passed over and who have not had their 
powers of observation and reason trained. The ser 
geant knew as a matter of fact that Jimmie was dead, 
or at least he had been told so and had no reason to 
doubt the fact. Yet when Jimmie appeared alive and 
well and apparently comfortable, the sergeant merely 
accepted the fact without any hesitation. Had he seen 
Jimmie, however, before the sniper's bullet severed 
the connection between his physical and vital bodies, 
the case would have been entirely different. 


A SERGEANT'S EXPERIENCE 31 

Jimmie 's very respectful mode of addressing the 
Elder Brother, too, was indicative not only of the at 
mosphere or aura of dignity and power which sur 
rounded the Elder Brother but showed the fact that 
these auric vibrations were not impeded by the phy 
sical body,hence were a thousand times more potent 
than would have been the case on the physical 
plane. Jimmie knew nothing of mental vibrations 
and had not the slightest idea that the cause of his 
attitude lay outside of himself, but of the fact of 
this respectful attitude he was aware, and he prompt 
ly set it down to his own good upbringing. 

The name which was given I miay not divulge, but 
in its place I will substitute, and say that the Elder 
Brother gave the name of Campion. 

The introduction over, the Elder Brother said : 
/'Jimmie, come to me in about an hour and bring 
your friend." 

' ' All right sir, but my watch has stopped and I will 
have to guess the time. And where will I find you, 
sir?" 

' ' I will send for you when the time comes. ' ' 

The Elder Brother apparently made a step from 
the bottom to the top of the trench and moved off 
towards the rear. The sergeant yelled to him and 
jumped to interfere but Jimmie caught him by the 
arm. Strew turned on Jimmie — 

"Stop him! Call him back ! " 


32 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

"Never mind him," Jimmie shouted, "listen to 
me—" 

"All right, Lieutenant, if you say so. But jiminy ! 
I'm glad to see you again. Say! did you notice the 
way that friend of yours took the whole height of the 
trench at one step ? Some man, that ! ' ' 

"He certainly is." 

"This '11 be great news for the boys to find you're 
all right again. We heard that you got killed three 
days ago. I'm mighty glad to find it was a mistake. 
But where have you been all this time?" 

Jimmie had come up at a time when there was a 
lull in the fighting, and Sergeant Strew 's was the 
only casualty at the time. The sergeant was so busy 
looking at and talking to Jimmie that he had not no 
ticed the group of men gathered about his dead 
body, and Jimmie was at a loss just how to break the 
news to him gently. He had never had such a job to 
do before — 

' i Well you see, Sergeant, the funny part about it is 
that what you heard was true." 

"What was true?" 

"Why, that I got killed." 

"You got hit on the bean, that's what's the mat 
ter with you. ' ' 

" No, I didn 't either. I 'm giving you the true dope. 
I got killed." 

"Jimmie, go back and tell the doc to fix your 


A SERGEANT'S EXPERIENCE 33 

noodle. You've got a bad case of 'bats in your gar 
ret.' I might have known it was like that or you'd 
never have brought that spry old gent out here with 
you which you very well know is against all the regu 
lations even if you are a lieutenant, and I don 't see 
how in thunder he ever got out so far, past all the 
officers. ' ' 

1 * Well, you see, it 's this way, Sergeant, lots of men 
get killed and never know what 's happened to them. ' ' 

"Yes, an' some think they're killed when nothing 
has happened. Why, if you'd been killed don't you 
see you would be a ghost now, and then how in the 
dickens could I see you and be talking to you? It 
can't be done, Jimmie. Yjou're just as much alive as 
I am." 

"That's true, too, Sergeant, but if you'll look be 
hind you a moment you'll see that you're just as dead 
as I am. ' ' 

Jimmie pointed past him to the dead body which 
had been laid out on the boards at the bottom of the 
trench ready to be taken to the rear if things kept 
quiet after dark, and the sergeant turned and looked. 
He looked long and quietly. He walked over and 
stood beside the body and looked at it carefully. He 
spoke to the sentry in the firing post ; when no answer 
was made he spoke again, more sharply, and then 
walked over and shook the man by the shoulder, or at 
tempted to shake him, but finding that his hand Went 

3 


34 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

through him he gave up the attempt, turned back to 
Jimmie, and said in a matter of fact way : 

"I guess you're right, Jimmie. I've cashed in." 

Jimmie looked at Sergeant Strew and Sergeant 
Strew looked at Jimmie. Neither knew what to say. 
The situation was a novel one, and though Jimmie 
might have found words with which to offer comfort 
to a friend who had lost some dear one, yet even tfliat 
task would have been hard ; but when it was the friend 
himself who had died and the one who sought to offer 
comfort was himself dead, the situation began to as 
sume something of the comical. Jimmie smiled a 
little. Things were too serious to laugh about, yet 
there was the element of humor and that very fact of 
itself struck him as funny, for humor and the life af 
ter death had seemed to him before this as being as 
far apart as the poles. No one had ever connected 
the two to his knowledge. The sergeant, however, 
was very grave. 

"So it's come at last," he said, partly to himself 
and partly to Jimmie. ' ' It 's come at last and it 's not 
nearly anything like I thought it would be. Say!" 
he looked at Jimmie, "You have been over here for 
three days and you ought to be feeling at home kinda 
by this time ; where are they ? ' ' 

"Where are what?" 

"Why, heaven, though I guess us fellers wouldn't 
go there just at first anyhow; but where 's all the 


A SERGEANT'S EXPERIENCE 35 

things the parsons talk about, hell and the devils an' 
the other things? This is just like where we were 
before an' I don't see much difference except that 
yap, Milvane, couldn't hear me when I spoke to him; 
but what does a feller do here? Do we go an' hunt 
for a harp to play on or do we go on fighting or what ? 
'Spose a lot of German ghosts come along, what are 
we to do?" 

"Darned if I know," said Jimmie to whom the idea 
was new. 

"Well, I don't know what we can do but I bet I 
can lick any blankety blank German ghost that ever 
lived." 

Jimmie felt a peculiar sensation. He had never 
been a profane boy and his worst expletive had usually 
been the mild word "darn." Stronger than this he 
seldom spoke but now that the sergeant used a few 
words of what the majority of the company would 
have classed as swearing, that is as real genuine swear 
ing, Jimmie felt a sensation almost akin to pain. It 
was a mixed feeling, not physical pain and yet much 
like it; it was much more than mere repugnance to 
something he formerly would not even have noticed. 
He remembered the Elder Brother's request and won 
dered if the hour was up, and if it was whether he 
ought to take this friend of his into the somewhat 
austere presence of that strange man. His doubts 
were solved for him by the sudden appearance from 


36 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

nowhere of a laughing little child who came dancing 
up to him,, singing in a semi-chant as children ofteii 
do: 

"Come along, Jimmie, the Elder Brother wants 
you. ' ' 

Jimmie turned to the sergeant who was attempting 
to interfere with a soldier busily engaged in remov-. 
ing the ammunition belt from the sergeant's discarded 
body. 

"Come on, Sergeant, Mr. Campion wants to see 
us." 

' ' T 'hell with your friend. Look at this gutter snipe 
here trying to rob me of all my cartridges an' he 
knows blame well I got all my tobacco in one of them 
pockets an' I'm responsible fer that belt. Drop it, 
gol darn you ! ' ' This last was addressed to the soldier 
at whom and through whom the sergeant swung a 
right hand blow that would, under former circum 
stances, have almost felled an ox, but the soldier paid 
no attention to it. The sergeant was inarticulate with 
rage. 

Jimmie had to stop a minute to get the situation 
clear in his own mind, and then with a laugh he in 
terposed between the fuming sergeant and the un 
concerned robber, who was not a robber but merely 
obeying his orders. 

"Come out of it, Sergeant! You're dead! Get 


A SERGEANT'S EXPERIENCE 37 

me ? You 're dead ! You can 't hurt that guy. Come 
along with me. You 're dead ! ' ' 

The sergeant stepped back a pace, looked at Jimmie 
with a puzzled expression on his face for a moment 
and scratched his head. 

"Danged if I aint," he said thoughtfully, "I for 
got that." 

"Sure." Jimmie smiled at him "and what good 
would your tobacco do you anyhow? You can't 
smoke now." 

The sergeant stopped short and straightened with 
a jerk, looking at Jimmie, his eyes growing wide wftth 
horror. 

"Aint that hell?" 

Again Jimmie felt that painful feeling surge over 
him at the sergeant's words, and again he doubted the 
advisability of taking this profane soldier, brave and 
honorable though he knew him to be, before the 
Elder Brother, who was, as Jimmie had "sized him 
up", something in the nature of a "Gospel Shar*p" 
or ' ' Sky Pilot. ' ' The army seldom used the word 
minister, and Jimmie had fallen into the army ver 
nacular. What would this friend of Marjorie's 
think if Sergeant Strew should forget himself and 
casually utter an expletive? 

Again the little child with the smiling face danced 
before his eyes and repeated the message. 


38 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

"Come along, Jimmie, the Elder Brother wants 
you." 

This time Jimmie determined to obey. 

"Come along, Sergeant, it's orders that I've got to 
bring you with me." 

The sergeant came along, pensively, muttering to 
himself something about tobacco and the utter useless- 
ness of any locality or state of being where the solac 
ing weed could not be smoked. Nevertheless, he fol 
lowed in a preoccupied manner, climbing out of the 
ditch after Jimmie and then nervously looking around 
as though just remembering that the sight of him 
might excite Fritz into starting a bombardment. 

"Don't worry," Jimmie said, noticing the ser 
geant's apprehension, "Fritz can't see you and if he 
could he couldn't hurt you. You're just as dead as 
you can get." 

' ' That 's right, I never thought of that. I aint got 
used to the idea of being dead yet. ' ' 

He drew his hand across his forehead wearily, then 
gave a gasp of dismay as he felt the hole in his head 
and took his hand away covered with blood. He felt 
gingerly of the place where the snipers had drilled 
him. "Say, I better go an' get this fixed up. This 
is a bad place to get hit. I might have got — it's a 
wonder it didn't — " 

He stopped short and looked at Jimmie wistfully. 
The wound had evidently startled him in a way, for 


A SERGEANT'S EXPERIENCE 39 

the fact was that in spite of the evidence he had not 
yet realized that he was dead. Often it takes a long 
time to realize a thing which we know and admit 
readily as a mere statement of fact. While the ser 
geant knew that he was dead, yet he had not realized 
it nor had he learned to co-ordinate his thoughts 
with what he knew to be the truth, and the old im 
pulse to get a wound ''fixed up" before any compli 
cations could set in was too strong to be shaken off. 

Jimmie did not know and so could not explain to 
the sergeant that the blood with which his hand was 
covered was merely the result of his own firmly fixed 
idea that there ought to be blood where there was such 
a large wound. Subconsciously the sergeant felt that 
if he were dead and a ghost, then it would follow that 
a ghost could not bleed. Yet he was bleeding, for was 
not his hand covered with blood? So, partly by con 
scious and partly by subsconscious methods he reach 
ed the point where he doubted whether he were really 
dead or not. Theories were thrown to the winds. The 
wound was a practical and compelling fact. 

' ' Say, Jimmie, I Ve got to go an ' get this fixed up. 
1 11 come an ' see your friend some other time. I gotta 
go before this gets worse." 

It was, indeed, a ghastly wound, not only where 
the bullet had entered the forehead but much more so 
where it had come out at the back of the head for there 
the wound was much larger. Jimmie realized the ne- 


40 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

cessity of getting it li fixed up," but then the thought 
flashed across his mind — where? 

Grand, merciful, and devoted as the Red Cross was, 
there was yet no hospital he knew of, where a man who 
could not be seen could be treated for a deadly^ wound 
of which he had already died. 

' ' Where you goin ' to, Sergeant, ' ' he asked, ' ' where 
do you think you can get that thing fixed up ? Don't 
you know that 's what killed you ? ' ' 

11 Don't they have no hospitals over here?" de 
manded the sergeant. "Where do ghosts go when 
they get hurt?" 

"They don't get hurt." 

"The dickens they don't! I'm hurt, aint I? If I 
don't get this fixed up somehow I'm liable to — to — " 

"To what, Sergeant? Come to life again?" 

"Darn you, Jimmie. This thing hurts like the 
dickens. It's a wonder you wouldn't flag a stretcher 
bearer or an ambulance or somethin' instead of 
standin7 there grinnin' like a durn fool. Of course 
they have ambulances over here. Naturally they 
would." 


CHAPTER III 
A SOUL FLIGHT 

' THERE are no ambulances, Sergeant, but 
I will take you where you can have your 
wound attended to." 

Jimmie turned to see who it was that had spoken 
and was somewhat startled to see the Elder Brother 
standing quietly with just the faint trace of a smile 
on his lips. 

' ' Please come with me, both of you. ' ' 

Both followed as a matter of course, it never oc 
curring to either to question that gentle voice, which 
for all its gentleness seemed to carry a note of final 
ity and authority. 

"Take his hand, Jimmie," said the Elder Brother, 
at the same time grasping the sergeant by the other 
arm. Jimmie did as he was told and was amazed to 
find himself traveling rapidly. In a few minutes 
they "lit" as he afterwards described it, and he found 
they were on a level lawn some hundred yards dis 
tant from an enormous building of the old Grecian 
style of architecture, constructed with huge sym 
metrical columns topped by Corinthian capitals, and 
with a peculiar irridescence or glow surrounding the 
entire structure. Jimmie was not sure at first, 
whether he actually saw this; indeed, he did not see 

41 


42 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

it continuously, and Sergeant Strew, who seemed to 
be just coming out of a dream, apparently did not 
see it at all. 

They passed, still hand in hand, across the lawn 
and up the rows of steps which surrounded the build 
ing and wound their way between what seemed end 
less rows of columns until the Elder Brother opened 
a door and motioned them before him into a room. 

He, himself, followed and having closed the door, 
turned to Sergeant Strew who was apparently faint 
from loss of blood. 

"And now, Sergeant, you must forgive me for 
having waited so long before attending to your in- 
jury." 

He opened a little cupboard and took from one of 
the shelves within, a small vial filled with a dark col 
ored substance of much the same consistency as vase 
line. 

' ' Now, Sergeant, on this side of the veil we can ac 
complish results far more rapidly than on the side you 
have just left, and you will find that if you will do 
as I say, your wound will be entirely healed without 
even leaving a scar. ' ' 

He stood in front of the sergeant, smeared a little 
of the dark substance on his own finger, and said : 

"Please stand perfectly still, Sergeant, and concen 
trate your mind on the way your forehead looked be- 


A SOUL FLIGHT 43 

fore you were wounded. Think of it that way and 
imagine that the wound was never made. ' ' 

He touched the sergeant's forehead lightly with 
the finger on which the dark substance was smeared. 
The sergeant closed his eyes and screwed his face into 
what he thought was the right expression for one who 
was concentrating. 

The Elder Brother removed his hand and to Jim- 
mie 's amazement the sergeant 's forehead was as clean 
and smooth as the forehead of a child — smooth, that 
is, except for the wrinkles produced by his extraordin 
ary facial contortions in trying to obey the Elder 
Brother 's command to ' ' concentrate. ' ' 

1 ' Well ! Well ! ' ' said Jimmie. 

Sergeant Strew opened his eyes. 

''Your wound's all gone, as though it had never 
been there at all." 

"Thasso?" He felt gingerly and inquiringly of 
his forehead. 

" Doctor, I sure have to hand it to you for a first 
class doc. You'd make a fortune in the States. Gee! 
But you must be a cracker jack!" 

The Elder Brother smiled. 

"You did it yourself, my friend. It was your 
own imagination and will power, not my skill, which 
healed you." 

Sergeant Strew looked rather mystified and furtive 
ly felt of his forehead as though in doubt of the perm- 


44 IN THE LAND OP THE LIVING DEAD 

anence of any change wrought by his own imagination, 
but the wound was still healed and he gave a little 
sight of relief. 

"Whew!" he said, "If I'd only known how to do 
that before ! " He turnel to the Elder Brother : * ' You 
really mean that I healed myself?" 

' * Exactly that. You healed yourself, and the stuff 
I smeared on was merely to help you concentrate. If 
you had had your arm blown off and had come over 
with only one arm you could have replaced your arm 
with as much ease as you have healed this wound. 
Matter on this side of the veil is wonderfully amen 
able to the power of the will, and the task which I 
wish to set you about at once is that of meeting your 
comrades when they pass over, quieting them and 
showing them how to heal their wounds and also 
drawing them away from the battle lines. 

"For those who pass over, the war has ended, and 
it is their duty as well as their privilege to help, not 
by fighting, but by getting others to stop fighting and 
to begin to turn their thoughts away from the earth 
plane and towards the great future and the tasks and 
duties which it holds. ' ' 

"But suppose the bosckes make a raid. What shall 
I do? How can I help fighting?" 

"By simply refusing to fight. You are not now on 
the physical plane where you could be compelled to 
fight. The Germans cannot hurt you even if they 


A SOUL FLIGHT 45 

do make a raid and surround you. All you have to 
do is to obey orders; ignore the Germans unless you 
can speak German, in which case it is your duty to 
help them to stop fighting and to heal their wounds 
just as much as it is your duty to help your own 
comrades. 

* ' And remember that while you are doing this work 
you are doing the work of the Master, and the power 
and the strength of the Master are with you so that 
nothing can hurt you. Only if you disobey orders and 
let your anger rise and attempt to injure anyone — 
only then could you be hurt. To put it shortly — 
obey orders and you are perfectly safe even if your 
work takes you into the middle of the whole German 
army. Disobey or let your passions lead you into 
hatred and anger and you will not be safe even if 
alone on an island in the Pacific Ocean. Do you un 
derstand ? ' ' 

The Elder Brother drew himself up as if he were a 
soldier standing at "attention." The sergeant was 
much impressed and clicked his heels together as he 
saluted, saying, 

' ' Your orders shall be obeyed, sir. ' ' 

"Just a moment, Sergeant." 

The Elder Brother stood very still for a moment, 
apparently thinking. He had stood in this attitude 
for about a minute when the door opened and a man 


46 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

in the uniform of a Canadian soldier entered. 

"You called, sir?" 

"Yes. Please go with Sergeant Strew and show 
him how we do our work. You would not be called 
into active service so soon, Sergeant," the Elder 
Brother went on, addressing our friend, "but the 
Germans are about to start another drive and a great 
many on both sides will be killed; and we need all 
our workers and many more. I am sure that you 
will do what you can to help those whom you can in 
fluence to quit the fighting and turn their attention 
to other things, now that they are on this side of the 
veil." 

Sergeant Strew and the Canadian saluted and went 
out. 

What happened to the sergeant and the manner in 
which he was inducted into the work of the great band 
of invisible helpers who are striving with might and 
main to avert a grave disaster to the world, Jimmie 
learned later. It was- replete with adventure and 
many terrible things, also some that were almost 
comic, but that is not really a part of this narrative. 

The Elder Brother stood for a moment lost in 
thought after the departure of Sergeant Strew, and 
Jimmie watched him, waiting for him to speak. Af 
ter a few minutes Jimmie broke the silence himself. 

"You spoke of my having certain duties, too, sir?" 

"Yes. But yours are different from those of the 


A SOUL FLIGHT 47 

sergeant. You are to learn as much as possible be 
cause the field of your activity will not be here. You 
are going back." 

"Back?" 

"Yes. You were not killed but only stunned, and 
when the right time comes you will be sent back to 
work in your own body again on the physical plane. 
There it will be your great and high privilege to tell, 
so far as lies in your power, the wonderful things 
which will be shown you and taught you here. 

"But if I am not dead, then is not all this a dream? 
And Marjorie told me I was dead. Did I only imag 
ine I saw Marjorie?" 

"No. You really saw Marjorie and talked to her; 
also, you are really over here now, because it is not 
necessary that one die in order to come over to this 
country. Marjorie was mistaken and very naturally 
so; the fact is that for some little time is was un 
certain whether it would be possible to re-integrate 
your etheric body quickly enough. But your work is 
needed on earth; you have earned the chance in your 
former lives and as there is a very great need, special 
help has been given you. Neither you nor Marjorie 
stopped to think that you have no wound." 

"That's right," Jimmie said, "come to think of it I 
haven't any wound. I hadn't stopped to think of 
that before. And yet I remember that I 've seen lots 
of dead men on the fields who had no wound. ' ' 


48 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

"That is very true. They were killed by shell 
shock, and that is the very thing which nearly killed 
you by driving your vital body out of your physical 
almost to the point of rupturing the silver cord. But 
for the fact that you are needed and were given extra 
help, you would be really and absolutely dead, as you 
call it ; you would be on this side of the veil with no 
chance of going back. But because in your past lives 
you made a start on the Path, took the vow of service, 
and by your work earned the opportunity for more 
service, it came to pass that when your etheric body 
was driven out by the explosion of the shell, the par 
ticles of your vital body were kept from utter disrup 
tion ; and when the time comes for you to go back to 
the physical body which is even now lying in a hos 
pital back of the lines, you will be helped to take with 
you the memory of what you have seen and heard 
here so that you can work to better advantage. In 
your sleep you have frequently seen and talked with 
Marjorie, and you have had many gliding trips with 
her in your dreams. But this time you were quite 
different, and it is no wonder that she was mistaken. ' ' 
' ' But I have never dreamed of her, sir ; it has always 
been one of the great regrets of my life." 

"Yes! Although you never dreamed of her, yet 
you and she met often and had many long trips to 
gether, for during sleep we are generally away from 
our bodies in Dreamland, though very few are able 


A SOUL FLIGHT 49 

to take back the memory of their visits to this land of 
the living dead, and those who are beginning to be 
able to do so, take back, quite often, only distorted and 
mixed up memories. One of the things I hope you 
will soon learn to do when you go back is to carry 
your consciousness through." 

"You say it can be done?" 

"Indeed yes; it is far easier than it would seem 
and especially for souls that are well advanced. In 
fact it is a constant wonder to me that more people 
are not able to do it. You have earned the privilege 
of doing this during your last two or three lives, and 
it will not be a very difficult task for you to acquire 
the ability. " 

"My last two or three lives? What do you mean 
by that? Do you mean that I have lived before?" 

"Exactly." 

"Where?" 

"On earth. And your last life was spent not so 
very far from where we are now, that is, it was in 
southern Europe." 

"But I always thought that when one died, he died; 
and that he either went to heaven or to — to the other 
place." 

"No! The scheme of human evolution is far 
greater and grander than that. And it is because it 
is so much more complex, and because of the great 
amount of work to be done and the fact that you can 

4 


50 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

be of great usefulness, that you are to be helped to 
go back. But first I want you to take a little trip 
with me." 

He beckoned to Jimmie, who followed him outside 
and took his hand in obedience to a gesture. There 
was a period of rapid traveling during which Jimmie 
caught only faint glimpses of the parts of the earth 
over which they flew, and before a minute had 
elapsed they stood in a poorly furnished room where 
a woman sat sewing by a small table while two little 
children were playing on the floor beside her. As she 
sewed, the tears dropped slowly down her cheeks 
though she made no sound, only occasionaly looking 
towards the table where lay an open letter. 

The Elder Brother stood very quietly in a corner. 
His grave face showed the pity which he felt, while 
Jimmie moved towards the table and glanced at the 
letter. It was the terse, formal, Government an 
nouncement that Henry L. E — had been mortally 
wounded in battle. 

Instinctively he drew back in respect for a grief 
so great. As he did so, a man in uniform entered 
through the closed door and stood there, his hands 
outstretched towards the woman, who paid no atten 
tion to him. In his tunic, just over the heart there 
was a little round hole, and the tunic was stained 
with blood. 


A SOUL FLIGHT 51 

' ' 0 Emma, ' ' the newcomer broke the silence : ' * Em 
ma!" he cried, with a little break in his voice. 

The woman did not answer, but she seemed a little 
uneasy and raised her head as though listening for 
some expected or hoped-for sound. The youngest 
child crept on all fours towards the man in uniform, 
uttering little gurgles of welcome which with a few 
months more practice might have developed into the 
familiar " Daddy/' 

With a sob the woman caught up the child ; ' 1 No, 
no, dear! Daddy hasn't come yet. He hasn't come 
yet!" 

"The baby sees him," said the Elder Brother to 
Jimmie, "but the woman does not, and perhaps it is 
just as well. When she goes to sleep tonight," he 
gaid, turning to the man in uniform and touching him 
on the arm, "When she goes to sleep tonight she will 
leave her body and will be with you until she wakes 
in the morning. Then you will remember but she will 
not. Every night you will be able to meet her and 
talk to her, and so you can help her to hear the bur 
den. In the meantime remember that your sepera- 
tion is only temporary and that you will see her and 
be with her and the children every night when they 
are asleep. You see, your parting is only temporary, 
after all. She has much the heavier burden to bear." 

The man in uniform held out his hand. 


52 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

''Thank you, Mister. You've taken a heavy load 
off my mind." 

The Elder Brother motioned to Jimmie and to 
gether they left by the now familiar glide, passing 
through the wall as though it had not been there. 
Outside they found themselves in the environs of a 
large city, and the Elder Brother chose a shaded side 
street, and moved along it slowly, almost walking. 
Not many people were on the street, and those they 
met paid no attention to them, evidently not seeing 
them. It caused Jimmie no little exertion at first to 
dodge pedestrians as they walked unconcernedly along 
the pavement. The Elder Brother, however, paid no 
attention to the people any more than they minded 
him, and walked right through them with as little 
concern as though they had been mere shadows. Jim 
mie watched him, then tried it himself and found to 
his relief that it caused him no inconvenience to walk 
through a person on the street, and that it was the 
only reasonable thing to do. 

"I have shown you a little of the suffering caused 
by the war," the Elder Brother said at length, "not 
that you did not already know about it but merely to 
bring home to you the fact that the greater part of 
the agony caused by the conflict arises from the idea 
that death means a complete and probably permanent 
separation. In spite of the fact that most people 
would tell you, if you asked, that they firmly believe 


A SOUL FLIGHT 53 

in a future life, the fact remains that few of them be- 
believe in it to the point of realization. 

" Death they can see and one-half of it they think 
they understand, but as to the life beyond they are 
more or less uncertain. If they could only know, not 
as a theory but as a fact, that they are spirits, .chil 
dren of the Great Father in heaven, and as such can 
no more die than He can, and if they could only re 
alize that this life is not the only one on earth, but 
that humanity lives again and again in constantly 
improving bodies and surroundings, also that their 
progress is ever onward and upward, it could be much 
accelerated and they could be spared much suffering 
by thus working with the Great Law. If they could 
only realize that they make their own troubles, and 
that the misfortunes which they bear are not the vis 
itations of a capricious deity but the results of their 
own disobedience to His Will (as shown in His great 
and just laws), either in their present life or in their 
past lives, and that just in proportion as they obey 
His moral law and practice the mode of conduct which 
Christ, the Great Master, laid down, just so far 
will they spare themselves suffering and fit them 
selves to be helpers in the great work of uplifting their 
fellows." 

He ceased speaking, his face glowing with light, and 
as Jimmie noticed a nimbus or cloud of irridescent 
beauty and faintly flushing colors surrounding him, 


54 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

there recurred to his mind an old verse which he had 
heard as a boy somewhere : 

"How bright these glorious spirits shine." 

"It is now nearly time for you to return," the 
Elder Brother continued, "and I cannot talk with 
you much more, so I will keep my promise and let you 
have a little time with Marjorie. But before we part 
I want to impress upon you that when you have re 
covered and are able to be about, I would like you to 
call on me in Paris." 

He mentioned a street and number. 

"But I thought — I thought you were — er — I 
thought you had — you see I thought you lived here 
altogether. ' ' 

The Elder Brother laughed. 

* ' No, indeed. I am still in the flesh, and when you 
are well enough I shall meet you in Paris and that will 
be one of the guarantees to you that all this is not 
a dream but a reality." 

He began to travel rapidly, and Jimmie, following 
in obedience to a gesture of command, soon found him 
self on the same gently sloping meadow where he had 
first recovered consciousness. 

"Marjorie will soon be here and I will leave you 
to her. She will explain some things to you, but you 
are not to look upon this meeting as our last nor on 
this as your only introduction to the land of the living 
dead. Your introduction to spiritual things has come 


A SOUL FLIGHT 55 

in a different manner than usual, but it is not a gift, 
for you have earned it, and it will be your duty to 
work ten times harder from now on. ' ' 

"He'll do it, too, won't you, Jimmie?" 

Marjorie who had come up unnoticed, stood smiling 
in front of them. Jimmie grasped her hand and 
smiled too. 

"Yes indeed, I will, sir." 

"Good-bye, then, for a while." 

Jimmie looked for Marjorie to say good-bye to the 
Elder Brother, but to his surprise they were alone. 

* * I've heard that you are to go back, and I 'm so glad 
for it means that you will be able to work on both 
sides of the veil at once. 0 Jimmie, how I envy you 
your chances to work ! ' ' 

The rest of Jimmie 's conversation with Marjorie, 
while of absorbing interest to themselves, does not 
particularly concern our story, and it would be an 
abuse of our clairvoyant privileges to set it down. 
Jimmie spoke of his disappointment in the fact that he 
had not been shown the great sights which had been 
promised him nor given any instructions as to the 
"work" which he was to do. 

Marjorie reassured him, and so absolute was her 
faith in the wisdom of the Elder Brother and so pos 
itive her assurances that Jimmie 's doubts were set at 
rest. 

His eyes had been growing heavier and heavier and 


56 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

an overpowering drowsiness began to steal upon him 
for which he tried to apologize, but Marjorie only 
smiled at him His last recollection was the sight of 
her standing there, a faint glow surrounding her and 
a smile on her face as she said. 

' ' You 're going back ! ' ' 

Then darkness seemed to cover all the Land of the 
Living Dead. 


CHAPTER IV 

BACK TO EARTH— A PRETTY NURSE 

A SENSATION of falling ; great swirling masses 
of darkness, felt, not seen; the impression of 
rushing through space at dizzy speed, alone, now head 
first, now feet foremost, utterly helpless to control 
the terrific plunge, yet with it all not uncomfortable 
nor particularly uneasy, merely curious to know the 
result of this unguided and precipitate excursion; 
dimly conscious of a lessening of the darkness and 
speed, a gradually increasing glow of twilight with no 
particular source and disclosing nothing in particular. 
Aeons of time were passing ; a final appearance of the 
sun seen dimly through clouds and fog, and little by 
little a clearing of the vision. Ages passed and the 
clouds became lighter and more rosy; a final slow 
change of the sun into the glint of daylight on a 
swinging incandescent globe and the rosy clouds into 
a white ceiling and walls. Nothing more was visible. 
A shadow fell upon the wall, and across the range of 
vision moved the head of a young goddess wearing 
the uniform cap of the Red Cross. 

57 


58 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

She looked a little like Marjorie. . . Who was 
Marjorie ? He tried to remember. The name came to 
him easily, Marjorie — Marjorie — who was Marjorie? 

Who was he, himself? Jim, Jimmie — who was 
Jimmie ? Where did he come from? Familiar name ! 
They called him Jimmie. They? Who? Who were 
' ' they ? ' ' Marjorie called him Jimmie. 

Who was that girl in the Red Cross cap who looked 
a little like Marjorie? She had stopped and was 
looking at him. No, she was not Marjorie. Marjorie 
was much prettier and Marjorie had a soft glow of 
light about her. Marjorie had seemed to be so much 
more alive than this girl and Marjorie glowed with 
light. This girl didn 't glow. Probably not her fault. 
Naturally, few girls could glow like Marjorie — he 
smiled. 

What was it that Marjorie had called it? Oh yes, 
an aura — aura. 

The girl in the Red Cross cap was smiling at 
him now but she didn't glow like Marjorie. Still 
she had a sweet smile. She was a nice girl. He knew 
it. She ought to glow. He would speak to her. 

A Red Cross nurse, passing on her rounds among 
her patients, saw one without a wound, who had lain 
unconscious for days, suffering from shell shock, but 
whom they had been unable to rouse, and as she 
glanced at him she was surprised and pleased at see- 


BACK TO EARTH— A PRETTY NURSE 59 

ing his eyes open and that he showed consciousness. 
He was watching her and his lips were moving 
feebly. She stepped to his side and bent her head 
until her ear was close to his lips. Then, only, she 
could faintly hear his words. 

' ' You 're not glowing. Where 's your aura ? ' ' 
The mystified nurse stroked his forehead gently as 
she straightened up, a great surge of pity for this poor 
human wreck of battle sweeping over her. His lips 
moved again, and again she bent to listen. 
" 'Scuse me. My mistake. You've got it." 
* ' Go to sleep now, you 're very much better. ' ' 
She laid her hand on his head for a few moments, 
and then as his regular breathing showed that he had 
followed her direction, she moved away on her rounds. 
Later, in making her report to the head nurse she re 
marked that number 32 had regained consciousness 
but was apparently a little "off," as he had asked 
foolish questions about why she did not glow and 
where her aura was. 

"What is an 'aura'?" she asked the head nurse. 
"It seems to me that I have heard the word some 
where. ' ' 

"I don't know, child. I don't think there is any 
such thing. He's just out of his head." 

Jimmie awoke from his sleep some hours later with 
his head fairly clear as to outward impressions but 
very confused as to other things. He went back over 


60 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

his experiences with Sergeant Strew, the Elder 
Brother, and Marjorie. They were vivid and distinct 
and he could remember almost every word, especially 
Marjorie's, but how did he come to be here and where 
was "here?" There were no hospitals in the ordin 
ary meaning of the term over there, yet he was in a 
hospital. Also the nurse walked and did not glide, 
and she had no aura though he remembered dimly that 
as she had bent over him when he first awoke and had 
touched his forehead so soothingly she had seemed to 
glow — yes, he remembered that she had all of a sudden 
been enveloped in a cloud of faint purple. He had 
said something to her at the time but he could not 
remember now what it was. He didn't care particu 
larly. It was enough just to lie here quietly and not 
think at all — not more than he had to, anyhow. This 
place might or might not be heaven, but it certainly 
was very comfortable. 

The nurse again stopped at his side. He smiled up 
at her, too comfortable and entirely satisfied to do 
more than smile. But she was a competent young wo 
man and did not approve of nurses smiling at patients 
or patients at nurses. She wanted to know how he 
felt and what his temperature was and insisted on 
shaking up his pillow and generally rousing him in 
a gentle way. But he didn't care. Who could be an 
noyed by the attentions of a goddess? Now that he 
was aroused enough to talk, he would find out where 


BACK TO EARTH — A PRETTY NURSE 61 

he was. He would go about it diplomatically so that 
she would not know what he was trying to find out. 
He spoke, and she was glad to hear his voice so much 
stronger. 

"Why don't you glide?" 

Poor fellow! His voice was stronger but evident 
ly his mind was wandering. Still one can often ac 
complish a great deal by humoring such cases, so she 
answered : 

"Why, don't you know that we're not allowed to 
dance in here, and besides, no one glides now. The 
only dances we have are the waltz and two or three 
other dance steps, but the glide is out of date. 

He looked at her, puzzled. Maybe it wasn't heaven. 
Maybe it was — no — it couldn't be. Her face was too 
sweet and altogether wholesome for that. 

"Tell me — say — " She bent down in sympathy 
at sight of so strong a man lying so helpless, in expec 
tation of some piteous revelation of shattered reason. 

"Where'm I at?" 

The revulsion of feeling was too much for her and 
she laughed outright. When she could stop laugh 
ing long enough to talk she answered his question. 

"You're in the American Hospital at Paris, France, 
and it's certain you're ever so much better — that is 
all except your grammar." 

Again, in watching her, he saw that wave of color 
surround her like a glow of purple light and he 


62 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

needed no words to tell him that though she might not 
glide nor know what an aura was, yet she was a true 
sister to those compassionate ones who spend their 
time in helping others even as the Master does. He 
knew, though he knew not how he knew, that such a 
glowing, pulsing, gentle, radiance cannot be counter 
feited by any art, skill, knowledge, or power however 
great. Nothing can produce it but purity, kindliness, 
love, and service. So he was satisfied for the time 
and lay back on his pillow and in a few seconds was 
asleep. 

It was a whole day later before he awoke again, this 
time in the full possession of his senses and memory, 
and when the nurse of the kindly face and the beauti 
ful aura made her rounds, she met a look of full rec 
ognition which told her at a glance that Jimmie's mind 
was entirely restored. 

"Good morning," she said smiling, "how's my 
shell shocked patient this morning? Still suffering 
from dislocation of grammar?" 

Jimmie grinned, "What did I say to you yester 
day?" 

"Oh nothing much. You were naturally a little 
light headed and you said some queer things. You 
asked me why I didn't dance and where my aura was 
and why I didn't glow. By the way, what is an aura? 
Is there such a thing, or did you just imagine the 
word?" 


BACK TO EARTH — A PRETTY NURSE 63 

"I don't know that I can tell you just what an aura 
is. I've heard the word and I think I know what it 
means. I'll tell you about it." 

Three days later Jimmie was allowed to go out for 
a walk. He felt practically well and very hungry 
but had to promise that if allowed to go out he would 
not buy anything to eat. 

1 ' I don 't know whether I can trust you or not, ' ' the 
doctor had said; "it may be better for Miss Louise 
to go with you.' 

' * I think very likely it would ' ' said Jimmie thought 
fully, "I think it would be much better." 

Miss Louise did not seem averse to a little walk when 
the doctor asked her if she would take her patient out 
for a stroll, and in fact appeared rather proud of the 
tall young lieutenant in his newly cleaned and pressed 
uniform from which all traces of the trench mud had 
been removed in the hospital laundry. 

" Which way shall we go?" she asked as they 
passed out of the hospital gate. 

"Do you know where the Rue de la Ex is?" 

"No, but we can ask." 

They asked. He asked in the best trench French, 
and she asked with a charming little hesitation in her 
accent and a most bewitching interrogatory raise of 
her eyebrows, but neither of them could make any 
thing of the answers they received. The replies were 


64 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

hidden in such a torrent of verbosity and gesticula 
tion that they were left no wiser than before. 

"I know what's the trouble," said Jimmie after the 
eighth or ninth native had left them in a maze of 
waving hands and shrugging shoulders. 

"Oh what is it? I'm so mortified about my 
French !" 

"Why it's all your fault." 

1 ' My fault ? ' ' her eyebrows went up in a distracting 
arch, "why?" 

"Why, these natives take a look at you and get so 
excited they can't talk sense. I don't blame them 
either." 

"Well I like that! Am I as bad looking as that?" 

"I didn't say you were bad looking. I said they 
looked at you and got excited." 

"Well! That's just the same as saying I'm bad 
looking. Thank you, Mister Lieutenant James West- 
man for your kind opinion. ' ' 

"Fishing!" 

"What do you mean, 'fishing'?" 

Jimmie saw his mistake and was afraid. He had 
not realized how much her good opinion meant to 
him, and now that it was in danger he was distinctly 
nervous. 

"Why, you know, Miss Louise, just what I mean. 
If you don't I'm going to tell you. I mean just this 
— say! you won't get mad if I tell you?" 


BACK TO EARTH— A PRETTY NURSE 65 

"Why I'm mad now — quite mad. You said I am 
so ugly that nobody can look at me without getting 
excited. ' ' 

"No, I didn't either, and I'm going to tell you now 
whether you get mad or not. What I mean is that 
you are so pretty that when anyone looks at you he 
just naturally — just — " 

"Just what?" 

' ' Just naturally loses his head, that 's what. That 's 
just what I do every time I look at you. Now get 
mad, if you want to." 

Silence. 

"Are you mad?" 

More silence. 

"Are you?" 

Her head was averted but as he bent to listen he 
thought he caught the words, 

"Not very." 

Jimmie's nature was to be carried away by his en 
thusiasm when he was greatly interested in a subject 
and he was carried away now. 

' * And I '11 tell you more and you can get mad if you 
want to, just as mad as you like. I know I've no 
right to say it, but I think it and I say you're the 
prettiest and sweetest and the nicest and the dearest 
girl in — in — " before Jimmie's memory flashed the 
picture of that other girl — dancing, tripping, airy, 
gliding, glowing Marjorie, golden Marjorie, sweet-

voiced gentle Marjorie, and he hesitated in his speech. 
Was he true, he wondered. His conscience smote him 
a little. Was it right to make love to two girls? He 
faltered. "In France," he ended lamely. 

Louise noted the falter in his voice. She did not 
know whether she was in love with this man or not. 
She had not tried to analyze her feelings, but she had 
thought that she was going to hear a proposal, and 
she was disappointed. This falter in his voice was 
too much of an anti-climax in his somewhat fiery 
speech, and while she did not understand, yet she was 
at a loss how to explain in any other than the ordin- 
any way ; clearly he had a sweetheart at home. Gently 
she disengaged herself from his grasp and slowly 
turned towards him. 

"I— I— think I'd better go now, Mr. Westman." 
There was just the faintest trace of a catch in her 
voice. 

"Louise! Oh Louise! Don't think that of me. I 
know what you are thinking of, but it's all a mistake 
dear. "Won't you listen to me?" 

She hesitated, provoked that he had tried to make 
love to her while he had a sweetheart in America, yet 
unwilling, too, to break with him entirely until she 
was sure that there was no misunderstanding. 

"Well Mr. Westman, what do you wish to say?" 

"I say you're the sweetest girl in the world!" 

"In France, you mean?" 


BACK TO EARTH— A PRETTY NURSE 67 

"No, in the whole wide world." 

"Are you sure?. Don't you mean in France?" 

" No ! I 'm sure, and I mean anywhere ! ' ' 

' ' How about the girl back home ? ' ' 

"There isn't any!" 

She looked at him meditatively at first, then with 
a little touch of contempt in her glance. He saw it 
and began to realize that his situation was desperate. 
Like a flash of light the realization came upon him 
that he loved this girl and must not lose her. He 
must not. 

"Then why did you stammer so just now?" 

"I'll tell you and you'll understand everything. 
Please listen to me, won't you?" 

"I'm listening now but I'm not hearing very 
much. ' ' 

' ' Well, I can explain all about it as we walk back. ' ' 

' ' Oh, I don 't know, Mr. Westman, I 'm not sure that 
I care to waste time over things that have to be 'ex 
plained. ' I think you are strong enough to take care 
of yourself now, and I have an errand I want to do 
anyhow, so I'll leave you here and hurry along." 

She left him in spite of his protests, and turned 
down a side street while Jimmie, loitering on the 
corner, watched her in the hope that she might relent 
and turn or look back. But he watched in vain. 

Sadly he turned toward the hospital. There was 
nowhere else for him to go. He did not care to visit 


68 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

a club or Y. M. C. A. for he was too sore and hurt to 
mix in a crowd of soldiers. He wanted only to be 
alone and to think up something to say to her that 
would change her mind. Suddenly the Elder Broth 
er 's words recurred to him : 

' ' Your introduction to spiritual things has come in 
an unusual way, but it is not a gift for you have 
earned it, and it will be your duty to work ten times 
harder from now on. ' ' 

He saw now that he had wholly forgotten his prom 
ise and the great work, whatever that might be, that 
was contained in the magic word "duty." He had 
somehow carelessly come to look upon his wonderful 
experiences as upon a dream. He had started out to 
find the address given by the Elder Brother and had 
calmly let everything go, in order to make love to a 
girl! Oh, but such a pretty girl! Thus he 
justified himself. This was undoubtedly a tangle. 
He was in love with two girls, both beautiful and 
sweet and altogether lovely, but one on earth and one 
in — in — well, say in Paradise. He could marry only 
one. Would that offend the other? Would Louise 
believe him when he told her of his other love and 
would she be jealous or not ? He thought, or at least 
he hoped, that she cared for him, but such a story as 
his would be hard for her to believe. 

Oh! the thought just struck him; The Elder 
Brother could straighten out this tangle providing 


BACK TO EARTH — A PRETTY NURSE 69 

there really were such a man. He did not know, him 
self, whether to believe his memory or not, and if Tie 
had any doubts, how could he expect Louise to believe ? 
Was there an Elder Brother, or was his great ad 
venture but another cloud of the stuff that dreams are 
made of? Stupid! There was proof — sure proof — if 
he could only find it — proof that would convince even 
Louise no matter how skeptical she might be. Hurrah ! 
He would put his dream to the test and proof which 
the Elder Brother himself had suggested, and in doing 
so he would prove it to himself and to Louise at the 
same time. 

Some French children playing in the street were 
astonished to see a lieutenant of "Les Amis" strolling 
slowly along the pavement, break suddenly into a run 
as if his very life depended upon his speed. 

Louise had not yet returned to the hospital when 
Jimmie forced himself to saunter leisurely in at the 
gate, but he determined to lose no opportunity and 
sat down in an easy chair to wait for her. 

Louise came in, feeling repentant for her exhibition 
of temper. After all, Jimmie was suffering from 
shell shock and such patients are not always fully re 
sponsible for their actions. Her vigorous walk by her 
self had done her good, and the brisk circulation which 
it had induced had made her more charitable by 
sweeping some of the cobwebs from her brain; and 


70 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

also it had brought the roses to her cheeks, though of 
course she was unaware of the fact. 

Jimmie sprang from his chair as she entered or at 
least he would have sprung if he could. As it was he 
got up as quickly as possible and came to meet her, 
and whether or not there are such things as auras and 
whether or not Louise would have recognized one if 
she had seen it, the fact remains that before Jimmie 
could speak a word she knew that every atom of his 
being was vibrant with apology and inquiry, remind 
ing her of nothing so much as a big, playful, lovable 
puppy in an agony of endeavor to please. Could she 
refuse to speak to him for a few minutes? No, of 
course she would hear what he had to say, though 
he must hurry for she went on duty in half an hour. 

And so Jimmie, who had made up his mind 
that the only way was to tell her exactly how matters 
stood, led her out into the little garden where a recre 
ation ground had been made for the convalescent pa 
tients, and there poured into her ears the story of his 
adventures from the time he found himself walking 
along the meadow until he finally awoke in the hos 
pital. She listened with interest, especially when he 
spoke of Marjorie. 

11 And so you see," he explained, "how very import 
ant is is that I should find that address, because if 


BACK TO EARTH — A PRETTY NURSE 71 

there is such a street and such a number and if there 
is a man named Campion living there, then it will 
prove the truth of all that I have told you and he will 
be able to help me out and convince you that the story 
is true." 

" There is no need of that, Mr. Westman, because 
whether or not the things you have told me really 
happened does not effect your truthfulness at all. I 
believe every word you have said and I think it won 
derful. How I should like to see some of those beau 
tiful colors you speak of. And Marjorie, too; she 
must be a dear!" 

Jimmie's heart throbbed violently at the joyful 
revelation that she accepted his story as true and con 
sequently forgave him for his loyalty to Marjorie. It 
was evident that Louise did not believe in the actual 
truth of his account, but so intense and earnest had 
been his manner in narrating his experiences that, 
though she considered the whole story the figment of 
a brain suffering from shell shock, she was firmly 
convinced that he believed it. That was all she really 
cared about, for it explained his hesitation and ac 
counted for his loving another girl as well as herself, 
a thing which she could in no wise have forgiven 
except for the fact that the other girl was merely a 


72 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

creature of the imagination and had no existence in 
reality. 

"Louise! Say Louise!" 

"Well?" 

"Gee! I'm glad we've had this talk. You know 
I 've been afraid you were mad at me. ' ' 

" So I was. I thought you were trying to flirt with 
me while all the time you had a sweetheart back 
home. ' ' 

"I don't blame you. But now that you know all 
about it, you've forgiven me, haven't you?" 

"Why, Mr. Westman, how absurd! There was 
nothing to forgive." 

"But I believe when you thought I had a sweet 
heart at home you cared a little bit or else you 
wouldn't have got mad. Say! Louise !" he dwelt on 
the word, pronouncing it lingeringly. "Louise — " 

"Well?" 

"Don't you think, maybe, after a while, after you 
know me a little better " 

"Well?" 

"Don't you think — maybe — perhaps — you might 
come to care a little more?" 

Silence. He took her hand as she turned her face 
away. 

"Couldn't you?" 

"Maybe—" 


BACK TO EARTH — A PRETTY NURSE 73 

The next day Jimmie sought and obtained per 
mission for another walk and for Louise to accompany 
him, which he assured the doctor was a necessity on 
account of the dizzy spells which might seize him at 
any time. The doctor demurred at first and kindly 
offered to send an orderly with him or another con 
valescent soldier who would not be subject to 
" spells," but Jimfrde's consternation was so evident 
that being very human and a kindly enough man, 
the doctor gave the necessary permission and then 
disgusted Jimmie by showing a quite superfluous 
anxiety in the matter, through an alleged fear that 
the " spells" might be the result of heart disease. 

Louise and Jimmie had studied the map of Paris in 
the meantime and had found that there actually was 
a Rue de la Ex, but this proved nothing,for he might 
have heard the name somewhere and the subjective 
mind with its wonderful memory might have brought 
that particular name out of all the rubbish with which 
it was loaded and have presented it to his shell shock 
ed imagination. Jimmie knew, or thought he knew, a 
great deal about the subjective mind and carefully 
explained the matter to Louise as they walked along, 
but it is a question as to whether his somewhat tech 
nical language enlightened her to any great extent. 
Even if it did it must be confessed that her interest 
in the mysteries of the subjective mind was not par 
ticularly intense. 


74 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

Before a certain house in the Rue de la Ex they 
halted. The house was there, but that proved noth 
ing. The front door was in an arched passage way 
which led to an inner courtyard. They rang the bell. 
A rattling of the door announced that someone inside 
was in the act of opening it. The next few moments 
would decide the matter. 


THK KU>I-:IC HKOTHKK IN Tin: Ku.su 

JIM Ml K and Louise awaited (he opening of the 
door with similar forebodings. Louise did not 
believe a single word of the wonderful story which 
Jimmie had told her, though she was firmly con- 
vineed that tJimmie himself believed it. Jimmie 
on tho other hand, with his vivid memory of the ad 
venture was eertain that it had really happened, but 
was distrustful of the outcome of this physical and 
concrete test, and was wondering what excuse lie 
could give if, as he feared, the house should prove 
to be tenanted by strangers. 

Louise expected the door to be opened by an ordi 
nary eoneierge and that tho inevitable disillusion 
ment would follow; she was trying to determine in 
her own mind what she could say to help .limmio 
over his disappointment. 

Jimmie feu rod much the same thing and was cast 
ing about for a plausible reason to give Louise for 
the collapse of his peculiar vision and was (hiding 
himself quite unsuccessful in the attempt, when the 
door opened. 

75 


76 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

Before them, with a welcoming and slightly quiz 
zical smile as though he had in some way divined 
their perplexities, stood the man of his dream, iden 
tical in every particular of dress and feature with 
the strange and powerful being who had become 
familiar to him in the Land of the Living Dead by 
the appellation of the " Elder Brother." 

Mutely accepting his cordial invitation they en 
tered a well furnished library, and not until then did 
Jimmie recover sufficiently from his bewilderment 
to introduce his companion. With some embarrass 
ment he presented Mr. Campion to Miss Louise Clay 
ton, with the brief statement that Miss Clayton was 
the nurse who had taken care of him during his re 
covery; that he had told her of his great adventure, 
and had asked her to accompany him on this expe 
dition. 

' ' I am very glad that you did so, Lieutenant West- 
man, for Miss Clayton was selected as your nurse 
for several reasons, not the least of which was the 
fact that she is quite an advanced soul and it was 
determined that the work of re-integrating your 
vital body would be more easily and quickly done 
with her help than through any other of the avail 
able nurses. You see, Miss Clayton, I am quite well 
acquainted with you though we have never met be 
fore." 


THE ELDER BROTHER IN THE FLESH 77 

Louise answered politely and somewhat formally 
but was unable to quite conceal her incredulity at 
the statement which Mr. Campion had made. 

"Nevertheless," Mr. Campion continued as though 
answering some objection, "you were selected and 
the wisdom of the choice is apparent in the result. 
You have a strong and well developed aura, and 
your vibrations are harmonious, owing to certain 
stellar combinations of which you are probably un 
aware; that was a great help when Jimmie here 
(I am not going to call him Lieutenant) was recover 
ing consciouness. You will, perhaps remember that 
as you bent over him to make out what he was mum 
bling, he asked you why you didn't glow and where 
your aura was and then immediately apologized by 
assuring you that you did glow?" 

Louise was perplexed. No one else had been pres 
ent to overhear that whispered conversation. The 
head nurse had not been out of the hospital and so 
could not have hunted up this man and told him of 
it, besides she had not told the head nurse much and 
had not spoken of it at all to any one else. Jimmie 
she was sure, had not been out of the hospital 
grounds except the one time when they had almost 
quarreled. Could he have written to this man or 
was the man a mind reader? If Jimmie had written, 
then he was deceiving her. If the man was a mind 
reader, then he was an uncannily shrewd one. She 


78 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

did not know what to say and so kept silent, but her 
glances roved about the room. 

Mr. Champion spoke: 

"Miss Clayton, you will pardon me, I am sure, if 
I endeavor to set your mind at rest and, incidentally, 
Jimmie's also. In doing so it will be necessary to 
make some statements which cannot be proven to 
you now and the explanation of which would require 
too much time, so I am going to ask you to hear me 
patiently and reserve your judgment until later. 

"To begin with, I must assure you that you are 
not the victim of any prepared plot and that Jimmie 
has not written to me nor did the head nurse give a 
second thought to what you told her. ' ' Louise looked 
up quickly, her eyes wide with wonder. "Then, too, 
your surprise at meeting a mind reader without the 
usual trappings of his trade was perfectly natural. 

"There are here none of the customary parapher 
nalia of the professional wonder worker, and you 
looked in vain for skulls and stuffed owls and somber 
drapery. I assure you that while mind reading is 
not at all difficult to the trained occultist, yet I was 
not reading your mind when I spoke of your few 
words with Jimmie when he regained consciousness 
I know what you said because I was there at the 
time—" 

Louise looked up, again with a gesture of surprise, 
and started to speak but remembered his request. 


THE ELDER BROTHER IN THE FLESH 79 

"I was there, although you did not see me and I 
followed you when you went to make your report 
to the head nurse. If you remember, she was sitting 
at a desk writing and when you spoke to her you 
were alone in the office with her. She did not turn 
around but merely stopped writing when you spoke 
to her. Then she answered you, 'I don't think there 
is such a thing, child.' Also, as you passed out of the 
office you met two orderlies bringing in a wounded 
man on a stretcher and just then one of them stum 
bled. You thought he was going to drop his burden and 
you gave a little gasp and started forward — There!" 
he smiled at her, "I think I have fully exonerated 
our friend here, for he could not have written me 
these things." 

Louise made an inimitably graceful little gesture 
of surrender. 

"And now for the reason underlying all these 
strange doings. The human race is made of a multi 
tude of individual spirits who are evolving or learn 
ing by repeated rebirths into physical bodies on the 
physical plane, where they learn to obey the great 
laws of our Father in heaven just as children learn 
their lessons day by day in school. In this great 
scheme of evolution we are subject to the operation 
of two great laws: First, that of rebirth, which 
brings us back to the concrete physical world again 
and again, in constantly, though slowly improving 


80 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

bodies and surroundings. Second the law of conse 
quence which decrees that we must suffer the natural 
results of our mistakes, which are usually called sins, 
even though many lives may sometimes intervene be 
tween the mistake and its result. 

"In order that this period of birth and death and 
learning and suffering may be shortened, as much 
help as possible is given the race by great hosts of 
spiritual beings who have themselves passed through 
similar schools. There are times (just as there are 
examinations in every school), when a turning 
point in evolution is reached, and the race is, as we 
might say, examined or quizzed to see which classes 
of entities are worthy of promotion. 

"This great war is the most tremendous turning 
point yet reached in human evolution, and the need 
of the race for help and instruction is greater than 
ever before. Help can be given in some respects more 
effectively by advanced members of the same race, 
and for that reason many individuals are being pro 
moted just now for the assistance and teachings which 
they are able to give. The need is tremendous — much 
more so than either you or Jimmie realize, and it 
was because of this fact that Jimmie was sent back 
to the physical life, for he would otherwise have re 
mained permanently on the other side. It is for this 
reason that you have been brought here with him for 
you must not think that it is the custom of occultists 


THE ELDER BROTHER IN THE FLESH 81 

to give displays of power merely in order to enter 
tain people. 

"You and Jimmie are both advanced souls (I am 
not saying this to flatter either of you) and in a fe v 
more lives would naturally reach the point to which 
it is hoped you will presently attain in this life if you 
are willing to work. Help will be given you, but you 
must remember the words of the Master that 'Unto 
whom much is given, of him much will be required.' 
So the choice of engaging in the work must be 
a purely voluntary one and not be made lightly, for 
as the benefit is great if we receive this teaching 
worthily, so is the danger great if we receive the 
same unworthily." 

Jimmie and Louise glanced at each other, both 
recognizing the allusion to that beautiful sentence 
in the communion service. Jimmie spoke: 

"You said something to me before, sir, about the 
great work, but you did not say what it was." 

"No. For some time it was uncertain whether 
your etheric body could be re-integrated in time, and 
when that was accomplished there was no oppor 
tunity for instruction." 

For more than an hour Mr. Campion went on, 
telling them about the different planes of being and 
the different bodies corresponding to those planes, 
and outlining the work of the Invisible Helpers with 
both the living and the dead. Louise and Jimmie 

6 


82 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

listened with wonder which gradually changed into 
aw;e as the tremendous Plan was sketched out for 
them. Never had they heard the like of it and yet 
it all seemed strangely familiar, just as though they 
ought to have known it anyway. As Mr. Campion 
proceeded and showed how it all fitted in with the 
Scriptures and particularly with the words spoken 
by the Christ, explaining the parables and throwing 
light into the dark and hidden places, Louise began 
to realize that all her doubts were swept away and 
felt ashamed that her mind had ever harbored them. 
No longer did she think of "proofs." No proofs 
were needed. No man, however great, could have 
invented such a scheme as this. Not even Mr. 
Campion, mind reader and occultist or whatever he 
was, could have originated such a complicated, inter 
locking plan. He did not need to assure her that it 
was true. She knew it though she did not realize how 
she knew it. It bore the imprint and signature of 
Divinity itself. 

Jimmie, too, had listened, absorbed. The things 
Mr. Campion was telling them explained some of the 
apparent contradictions which he had observed dur 
ing his brief stay on the other side, and when the 
theory and practice of attaining the freedom of the 
other planes of being were detailed, he began to 
understand that it really is not necessary to die in 
order to prove immortality. 


THE ELDER BROTHER IN THE FLESH 83 

"But why was it, then," he asked, "if there is 
all this hard work to be done on the other side — why 
was so much trouble taken to send me back?" 

"Because the crying need is for those on this side 
of the veil who know the fact of immortality, who 
have visited the other country and have returned, 
who are willing and able to make their knowledge 
known, who can comfort the dying and more espec 
ially those who are left behind. The need is for those 
who can say, 'I know/ as well as, 'I believe.' ' 

"Then if I persist in the exercises you have out 
lined, you think that I can develop my spiritual 
sight?" 

"Undoubtedly you can, and while I must not in 
fluence you one way or the other, since the choice 
must be of your own free will, yet you know how I 
long to meet you again as a volunteer in the Great 
Army in which you are enlisted anyhow." 

Jimmie felt that it was a very serious moment. He 
wanted to help. His heart flowed out in sympathy 
with those who are suffering and dying and yet — 
— yet — that thing of " living the life" — could he do 
it? When he got back to his regiment and his com 
pany — could he keep it up? Then a doubt crept into 
his mind. Mr. Campion had said, or had as good as 
said, that in sleep almost every one helps, more or 
less, so why could he not do whatever was possible 


84 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

during conscious hours and trust to being an uncon 
scious invisible helper during sleep? 

Mr. Campion sat, watching them. Louise was 
looking at him but not watching him. Her eyes had 
that "far away" expression which showed that her 
mind was busy with other things, as quickly be 
came evident when she spoke. 

"Please tell me, Mr. Campion, if you will, just 
why the embodied worker who has the freedom of 
the other planes is so much more valuable than the 
disembodied worker or the worker who cannot con 
sciously visit the higher worlds — does it not have 
something to do with the will power?" 

"You have the idea, Miss Clayton. The embodied 
worker has a power which the same man, having 
lost his body by death does not have. The explana 
tion is a long one but you have come very near the 
mark when you speak of will power. Also, the 
worker on the other side is dealing largely with those 
who have just passed over, whose day in school is 
done, and whose period of reviewing the physical life 
has commenced. The worker on this side of the veil, 
however, may be able to influence the lives of many, 
causing them to refrain from things which they oth 
erwise would do and to avoid much of the pain of 
purgatory by leaving undone, actions which would 
have brought on them a great debt of destiny." 

Jimmie and Louise walked back to the hospital 
very quietly. Each was busy thinking and their oc- 


THE ELDER BROTHER IN THE FLESH 85 

casional intervals of conversation were to review 
some of the things Mr. Campion had said. 

Just before they reached the big gate Louise spoke : 

"Jimmie! I have a confession to make." 

"What is it?" 

"Do you know, before we went into that house 1 
really did not think that your adventure was any 
thing but imagination. I thought it was just one of 
those 'shell shock' dreams." 

"I was afraid you did." 

"But you needn't be afraid any longer. I believe 
every word of it now." 

The very excusable pleasure which Jimmie showed 
plainly in his face and which arose entirely from 
satisfaction at having his story finally believed must 
have caused the old French porter at the gate to draw 
some highly erroneous conclusions — judging from 
the smile with which his wrinkled old face was 
wreathed as Jimmie and Louise entered the hospital; 
or else, it is possible, we may have failed to overhear 

the entire conversation. 

* * * 

Back once more with his company and after the 
hearty greetings and congratulations at his escape 
were over, Jimmie settled down to the steady grind 
of drill and training which took up a considerable 
part of the time, even though they were now in a 
"rest billet" behind the lines. 


86 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

The everyday, well known affairs of the now fa 
miliar army life, the constant contact with his men 
and his brother officers with all of whom he was & 
prime favorite, tended to dull the keen edge of his 
enthusiasm, and prosaic, comnnonplace thoughts 
usurped the place of the high ideals and noble aspira 
tions which had so thrilled him. The glamour of his 
trip into the Land of the Living Dead began to pale 
somewhat. Pressing, urgent duties, insistent, demand 
ing duties claimed his time. When drill and the var 
ious forms of training were over, he was tired and 
only too willing to be swept along with the crowd on 
a visit to the "Y" or some entertainment. Always he 
tried to quiet his conscience with the promise that he 
would do something in earnest soon, just as soon as 
he got well rested. 

In the meantime, as he had promised, he kept up 
the foolishly simple little exercise that Mr. Campion 
had given him and which he went through with every 
night just as regularly as clockwork, though he could 
not see, to save his life, how so ridiculously elemen 
tary a thing could have any great effect upon him. 
It stood to reason, he thought, that Mr. Campion was 
wrong, else why should not this exercise be widely 
known? Why did not some of the ministers of the 
different churches know about it and teach it? He 
knew, that some of the criticism leveled at the heads 
of ministers was deserved, but he knew that, taken 
as a whole and averaging them up, the ministers 
were honest and conscientious and doing their best 


THE ELDER BROTHER IN THE FLESH 87 

according to their light. Why, then, did they not 
know of such a thing if it were really true? 

He was seated one afternoon, writing in a corner 
of the "Y". Not many men were there but close to 
him an elderly and somewhat over zealous secretary 
was taking to task a little group of soldiers who were 
evidently remiss in their attendance at the services. 
These men had been in battle. They had seen their 
comrades die — wounded — blown to atoms — gassed, 
gasping with raw and bleeding lungs for one breath 
of air they could not seem to reach. These men had 
seen their friends, young, brave, with all of life be 
fore them, suddenly die, and the effect of such ex 
periences had produced in them a broader or a 
deeper or a higher, at any rate, a different, attitude 
toward the great enigma of life. 

The secretary had just come over and was full of 
zeal to save the souls of these poor, lost wander 
ers, to snatch the brands from the burning. They 
must come and be saved. They must put on salva 
tion. They must accept Christ or forever they 
would burn in hell as children of the devil. 
They must become converted and filled with 
grace before it was too late and the bottomless pit 
yawned for them with the everlasting fires and — 

"Oh, can that brimstone stuff!" 

This interruption of a new voice with an evident 
note of impatience in it caught Jimmie's attention 
and he looked around at the speaker with interest. 


CHAPTER VI 
A DOUGHBOY'S IDEAS ON RELIGION 

THE tone of voice of the last speaker attracted 
the attention of our friend Jimmie and he 
listened with interest. 

"What — what — what do you mean?" stammered 
the horrified secretary. 

* ' Just that. Can that everlasting fire stuff. It isn 't 
logical and it isn't scriptural and it isn't Christian 
and it isn't in the Bible anyway, and a God who 
would act the way you say He does would be a devil 
and not a God." 

It was a tall, lean doughboy who spoke. The 
interval of silence caused by a stupefaction of the 
horrified secretary, who really could not believe his 
ears and was dumb from amazement, gave Jimmie a 
chance to take a hurried glance at the group before 
the doughboy continued: 

"Who is God, anyhow?" 

"Who is God! Who is God! Oh, my poor, poor 
brother! Can you be so ignorant as to ask that 
question ? ' ' 

"You bet I can! You seem to know a lot about 
Him, at least you are allowing that you do. Now 

88 


A DOUGHBOY'S IDEAS ON RELIGION 89 

tell me just who He is and what is His business.'' 

''Who is He? Oh, dear, dear ! With a rod of iron 
he rules the world and breaks in it pieces like a 
potter's vessel. He made you and He gave his only 
Son to die for you to save you from eternal damna 
tion, and you ask who He is!" 

"Now listen to me, parson. I don't mean to be 
unkind and I don't mean to be irreverent, but I've 
been through that hell out yonder and I saw my 
chum, the finest fellow that ever wore shoe leather 
and the bravest man — " here he glared around the 
little circle as though challenging any one to deny 
the fact — "the bravest man that ever lived. I saw 
him hit with a shell which took both his legs off, 
and he died right there in my arms and he didn't 
have a chance. I saw him die and I've got to go 
back when this thing is over, if I'm alive, and tell 
his wife and his mother how he died. And you tell 
me that God made the world and rules the world and 
He allows things like this war to happen? Why 
didn't He stop it? If He is as great and holy as 
you say, why didn't He stop the men who began 
this thing?" 

"My poor, poor, ignorant brother. God did not 
permit this war. It was the devil, that great Adver 
sary, who brought this on." 

"Then God doesn't rule the world! He made us 
but He made such a poor job He had to send His 


90 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

only Son to die to save us, and even at that He only 
saves a few — by your own reckoning the great ma* 
jority are going to hell ; I heard you say so when you 
spoke of the broad, easy way that leads to destruc 
tion. " 

11 Oh, but, my brother, that is all in the Bible. Do 
you mean to deny the Word of God?" 

"I don't know just what I'm denying, but I don't 
believe the Bible says that at all. I believe you go 
to the Bible and get out of it just what you happen 
to want to get out of it and not what the Bible wants 
to give you. Now you listen to me for a moment and 
tell me if I make a mistake. God is almighty. Is 
that so?" 

"Yes, yes, it is indeed and — " 

"Now just wait a minute, parson, if you'll excuse 
me, it's my inning right now and I am after getting 
at the truth if I can. Now to start over again — God 
is almighty — that means He is able to do anything?" 

"Yes indeed." 

"And I heard a minister say once that He is omni 
potent?" 

"Yes." 

"That means that He is almighty but it means a 
lot more too." 

"Gee! You're a regular lawyer!" was the admir 
ing interjection from another soldier in the group. 


A DOUGHBOY'S IDEAS ON RELIGION 91 

"Well, I studied law a lot and practiced a little 
too, but I never trained for this kind of a fight. " 

"Now, my brother, let me give you some tracts to 
read— " 

"No parson, I don't want to read any tracts. They 
all shy away from the big questions. You began 
this thing and I want you to stand up like a man 
and see it through because I'm not trying to damage 
religion any. I'm really and honestly looking for 
light, but I want real light — sunlight — not any of 
your tallow candle variety. I want to get at the 
truth. I've been in hell out there past the trenches 
and I've walked face to face with death and so have 
all these boys here, and we are looking for truth — 
fact — true truth, not any counterfeit. Now I am 
right here to tell you, parson, that my eternal happi 
ness is worth just as much to me as yours is to you, 
and I'm not trying to shock you — I want the truth — 
so do all these boys." 

"But, brother, I have told you. Accept Christ — 
put on the Gospel armor and you can resist all the 
wiles of the enemy." 

"There you go, parson, evading the issue. The 
questions are: Who is God, why did He make us, 
why did He allow this war to come on?" 

"Oh, but you are wrong. He didn't allow it. It 
is all against his will — " 

"Against His will and He omnipotent? No, par 
son, you've got to try again." 


92 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

"But I tell you, brother, you must come humbly 
to the throne of grace. Accept Christ with the right 
hand of fellowship and even now you may be saved. ' ' 

The tall soldier looked at the secretary for a mom 
ent, gave a sigh and turned away. 

"It always ends this way," he said to another of 
the group; " I never knew a parson who could hold 
up his end in a real discussion with any one who 
wants to know the real truth if there is such a 
thing to be known. They always shirk and dodge. 
So long, parson," he said pleasantly as he passed out 
of the building. 

Jimmie hastily folded his letter, stuck it in his 
pocket, and followed. Here, perhaps, was a chance 
to begin on the great work. The Elder Brother had 
said that the work would not be forced on him but 
that he would be given chances to work if he were in 
earnest. Perhaps this was a chance. He overtook 
the man, who quietly saluted as he fell into step 
with him. 

"I overheard part of your talk with the secretary, " 
said Jimmie, "and I want to ask you, if I may, 
whether you were really in earnest when you said 
that you wanted to know the truth?" 

"You bet I was, Lieutenant, but I never can get 
a minister to answer the questions I want to ask, and 
yet they seem reasonable to me." 


A DOUGHBOY 's IDEAS ON RELIGION 93 

"I think I can answer your questions. If you will 
let me take the parson's place, and anyhow I think 
we would enjoy the discussion." 

"All right, sir." 

The tone was a resigned one, and Jimmie sensed 
the situation. The tall soldier had told the truth 
when he said that he wanted light but was disgusted 
at the idea that a very youthful second lieutenant 
should take up the scanty leisure of a tired soldier 
with a lot of useless discussion on a subject of which 
he must be completely ignorant. He (the soldier) 
had applied frequently for light to the regularly ap 
pointed light-bearers and had received — darkness. 
For this second lieutenant to presume to have what 
none of the ministers had was like a grammar school 
boy offering to teach a major-general the rudiments 
of strategy. However, the tall soldier was good-na 
tured and decided to put up with the infliction for a 
few minutes to see what the lieutenant had to say. 

Jimmie said after a little awkward silence: 

"You know, I felt sorry for that poor secretary 
back there; you put some hard questions to him." 

The tall soldier chuckled: 

"They did kinda get his goat, didn't they?" 

"They sure did. Yet the answers are very simple." 

"I wish you'd give them." 

"Well — ask your questions." 

"Is there a life after death?" 

"Yes." 


94 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

"How do you know?" 

"Because I've been there and come back." 

"Gee! You scored that time, maybe. But here's 
another: How do you know that you've been there 
and come back?" 

"I thought you would ask that question. I know 
that I have been over there and come back because 
I have met and talked with people there whom I 
knew in earth life, and also because I met and talked 
with a man there whom I had never known before 
but who had not laid aside his physical body, and by 
following his instructions I have met him in the 
physical body afterwards. Still, I fully recognize the 
tact that what is proof to me is not proof to you, 
because you have only my word for It ; and even if 
you knew me well and did not doubt my word, yet 
there is a large margin for error of judgment, so 
that strictly speaking there can be no 'proof for you 
except through your own experience. But, there may 
be a secondary proof, circumstantial evidence as 
you might say, which would be ten times more con 
vincing 'proof than anything I might tell you, even 
if you did not doubt my word." 

"Just what do you mean?" 

' ' I mean this : You have been told from your child 
hood that there is a God, that He is wisdom, knowl 
edge, love, etc. You see certain facts in the world 
around you which you find hard to reconcile with 


A DOUGHBOY'S IDEAS ON EELJGION 95 

such an idea of God. You see injustice, misery, war, 
pain, sorrow, parting; you see some who are lucky 
all their lives and some who are unlucky through 
no fault of their own. You see all these things and 
you naturally want to know why they exist in a 
world which has been created by a Being whose name 
is love. Since they do exist and since they are not 
the evidences of love, you argue that God either does 
not exist at all or that He is lacking in some of the 
attributes you have always ascribed to Him or that 
there is a Rival Power of darkness, almost, if not 
quite, as powerful as God. Is that not so?" 
" That's the case exactly, Lieutenant." 
"You ask for the reasons why such things are 
allowed in the world and you are met with evasions 
and platitudes which show you that the men who 
are supposed to know most about the things of God 
are really as ignorant as yourself but not honest 
enough to admit it. They believe certain things on 
what seems to you to be insufficient evidence, and 
they wish you to believe just what they do but are 
wholly unable to answer any of your questions and 
even resent the asking of the questions. Yet the 
whole matter becomes plain as day when you realize 
that we are all evolving spirits, parts of God just as 
the Bible says, who are growing in experience and 
knowledge and power through living many lives on 
earth, one after another. We are subject to two great 


96 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

laws, first, that of rebirth which brings us back 
again and again to life on the physical plane, and 
second, that of consequence which decrees that we 
must reap just what we sow — again just as the 
Bible tells us. In between our earth lives we are in 
another state of consciousness in which the exper 
ience of the past life is incorporated into our spirit 
as conscience. Sin is the result of ignorance of 
God's laws, and the resultant suffering in time 
teaches us how to obey these laws, just as a child that 
has burnt its finger learns to avoid a hot stove. But 
some are fortunate because they have progressed 
farther on the path of evolution than others, have 
learned more lessons, and are able to live more nearly 
according to God's law. Others are unfortunate be 
cause in past lives they have done wrong and have 
laid up more of a debt; or rather because they have 
not progressed as far upon the path of evolution 
and so have not paid off as many of their debts, for 
no one in all God's universe is called upon to suffer 
anything which he has not deserved by his actions 
in the past; but you must remember that the past 
extends over hundreds of lives. In the great scheme 
of human evolution there are great turning points 
where extra help is given. This war is one of those 
points and was allowed to come on because the race 
was becoming bogged in materialism, and a great 
shock was needed to turn the thought of humanity 


A DOUGHBOY'S IDEAS ON RELIGION 97 

back to the only real thing in the world, which is 
the study of the laws of God and the attempt to obey 
them. And the laws of God were never better sum 
marized than by Christ when He said to love God 
supremely and thy neighbor as thyself. Do I make 
myself plain?" 

"Y-e-s, but if I have lived before, why don't I re 
member it?" 

"Well, the causes which operate to prevent your 
remembering your past lives are complex and would 
take a long time to explain. But the fact remains 
that it is a merciful provision of nature, because if 
you did remember all your past lives you could not 
advance at all, for the old loves and hates of the 
past would compel you to wrong actions. A boy in 
school uses a slate until he is past the primary 
grades and does not make many mistakes in figures. 
Later on he discards his slate and uses pencil and 
paper, and still later he uses ink. So with us. When 
we learn to live right and not make so many mis 
takes, when we are freer from the passions of hatred 
and revenge, we shall remember all our past lives." 

"It seems to be all right but I can't see why I 
don't remember if I have lived before." 

"Think it over and maybe you will see." 

Jimmie judged it best to drop the subject here and 
left the man to go on his way. He was disappointed, 
too, for to his enthusiasm the inability to see so 

7 


98 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

plain a matter was a little disheartening. He had 
not realized the fact that each one has his limita- 
tations and that the limitations of one are at a differ 
ent distance from the center than those of another. A 
large circle can contain a smaller and can comprehend 
it and the fact that there is space beyond the confines 
of the smaller circle, but the smaller one cannot 
comprehend the large one until it has learned to 
reason from the existence of still smaller circles that 
there may be something beyond its own limitations. 
It is easy for us to see the limitations of others but 
hard to see our own until we learn first to cast out 
the beam which is in our own eye before we attempt 
to remove the moat which is in our brother's eye. 

And now began for Jimmie a life in which he 
found little time for the particular work he was so 
anxious to do. His regiment was sent back to the 
trenches and the strenuous life and the little real 
privacy and quiet which he could command hindered 
his attempts to further his own advancement. He 
did, however, manage to perform, most of the time 
the simple exercises which Mr. Campion had given 
him and managed to say a few1 words about the 
higher life now and then when the chance offered. 
But the excitement of the actual fighting, for his 
regiment was brigaded with a British army contin 
gent and was holding back the German advance in 
the spring of 1918, focused his attention almost 


A DOUGHBOY'S IDEAS ON RELIGION 99 

wholly upon military affairs. The matter, though, 
was in stronger hands than his, and one day, in a 
charge to retake a trench, he received a bullet in his 
right arm and was sent back to a hospital, fuming 
at his ill luck. 

In this hospital there was no Louise, and he had 
been there hardly long enough to get his wound well 
dressed before he received orders to sail at once for 
America for instruction duty in one of the big train 
ing camps. He tried in vain for long enough leave 
to hunt up Miss Clayton, but the situation was ur 
gent and his orders were peremptory. He wrote a 
despairing letter to Mr. Campion but received no re 
ply and was forced to board a returning transport, 
in charge of a small contingent of wounded men, his 
great work undone, Louise and Mr. Campion left be 
hind in France, his comrades still fighting tooth and 
nail to hold the grey flood, and himself in what he 
bitterly asserted to be perfect physical condition, 
forced to go home before the war was won. 

Oh, the bitterness of that embarkation, leaving be 
hind him in France the Great War in which he wished 
to continue, the girl whom he had grown to love and 
the man to whom he looked for guidance in the great 
work which he had dimly sensed! Leaving behind 
all the great activities which had entered his life and 
had changed it so completely, leaving it all for 
what? A safety which he despised, a work which he 


100 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

felt others could do far better than he, a life of un 
welcome ease and that dreadful, gnawing sense of 
separation from] those whom he wished to be near. 

Jimmie went aboard the transport, weighed down 
with a feeling of injustice and calamity. His arm 
gave him considerable trouble for it was encased in 
a sling most of the time, and yet he knew that at the 
front he would have hardly noticed such pain as it 
caused. But now little things annoyed him and 
trifles seemed important, and he grew, not peevish, 
for Jimmie had naturally too sunny a disposition 
for that, but less buoyantly joyful than he had gen 
erally been. He spent as little time out of his cabin 
as possible and was generally supposed to be suffer 
ing more from the shell shock than from the wound 
in his arm. As shell shock is a most peculiar thing 
and acts in a thousand different ways, his little 
foibles were passed over without remark and he was 
humored in them to the greatest possible extent. 

The ship had been two nights and two days at sea 
and it was late in the evening of the third day, long 
after dark, that he stood at the rail alone looking 
wistfully out over the water. The moon was rising, 
a brand new moon, giving too little light to dim the 
beauty of the friendly stars. The breeze was blow 
ing gently from the southward and the great ship 
drove through the darkness without even the glim 
mer of a light to mark her way, heaving slowly and 


A DOUGHBOY'S IDEAS ON RELIGION 101 

gently to the long, easy swells and rolling with 
something of dignity in her motion as though in a 
dim way she sensed her separate existence and the 
value of the precious human freight she bore. 

Jimmie leaned against the rail drinking deep 
breaths of the salty air which tasted so clean and 
fresh after the reek of No-Man 's-Land, fouled, with 
human hatred and the wrecks of human war, and 
watched each long, low roller brimming slowly to 
the vessel's side and raising her so easily, so quietly, 
as though the lifting of a score of thousand tons 
of weight were the merest play. The exhibition of 
such tremendous power slowly brought into Jimmie 's 
mind, torn with grief and disappointment, a feeling 
of calmness and rest, and when he looked from the 
ocean to the sky and watched the great stars shining 
quietly above him as they had shone above Columbus 
and the sailors of the Spanish Main, as they had 
shone above Rome and Carthage, above Babylon and 
Baalbec, above the builders of the pyramids and 
the armies and the navies of old Atlantis, he felt 
stealing over him a faint perception of that great 
Power whose Being they attested and whose majestic 
purpose could not be thwarted a hair's breadth even 
by the great upheaval of all the peoples of the globe. 

His mind ran back over history and he pictured 
to himself the wars and plagues and pestilences and 
famines, the myriad scenes of battle and murder and 


102 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

sudden death,of quiet lives of unknown peoples, of 
the loves and the hates of mjen and women dead a 
thousand or ten thousand years ago, upon all of 
whom these same stars had gazed with the same 
quiet calm, waiting unperturbed the working out of 
God's great Plan. 

It seemed to him as the pictures of these things 
flashed through his mind, as though the world swung 
on its way through space leaving swirling behind it 
like a dense cloud of smoke visible to spiritual eyes, 
the prayers and tears of all humanity, the screams of 
the wounded and the dying upon all the battlefields 
since human history began, the appeals for mercy, 
the agony of despair, the strife of nations, the rise 
of races and their fall, the cry of the starving — all 
united in this dense black cloud which must roll up 
ward to the very Throne of God. And through it 
all there sounded that same despairing appeal — 
Why! 

And then he thought of his own little part in the 
mightly Drama, how he had been protected and 
shown a little of the great Plot, how a corner of the 
dark Curtain had been lifted for a moment so that 
he might catch a glimpse of that which lay beyond 
in order that he might know how to help. 

How had he fulfilled his mission? What had he 
done? In his talk with the soldier who had asked 
such pointed questions at the "Y" hut, what had 
he accomplished? Nothing! 


A DOUGHBOY'S IDEAS ON RELIGION 103 

His conscience troubled him, yet, after all, what 
could he have done by argument! This question, 
as he began to feel, was one too great to be solved 
by any burst of enthusiasm, however ardent. It 
must be the quiet, steady work of time, unremitting, 
unrelenting, seeking every opportunity, undaunted 
by failure, and satisfied if, here and there, one per 
son could be helped though ever so slightly. Then, 
perhaps, after the war he might return to Paris and 
meet again that wise man, Mr. Campion, the "Elder 
Brother," and learn how to fit himself for the great 
work. 

And as his thought steadied itself into that firm 
resolve to "carry on," no matter how hopeless the 
task might seem, the calm of the great stars filled 
his heart and he turned away to seek his cabin and 
perhaps write a few more words in a letter to Louise 
which he intended to mail to her as soon as he got 
ashore. 

As he carefully closed his cabin door before turn 
ing on the light which he as an officer was allowed 
and which was so thoroughly screened that no 
glimmer could possibly escape to be seen by lurking 
submarines, his mind was filled with the magic of 
the stars, of the sea, and keyed with the resolve to 
prove himself worthy, in time, of the confidence 
which had been placed in him ; to show Mr. Campion, 
if he could ever find that gentleman again, that he 
was not an utterly unworthy pupil. 


104 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

But he was not prepared for the shock which met 
him as he turned away from the door. Sitting 
quietly in the one chair which the cabin boasted, as 
though his presence were the most natural thing in 
the world, was the very man about whom Jimmie 
had just been thinking — Mr. Campion. 

Jimmie started with surprise, gasped out, 
"Wh-wh-why!" and held out his hand to his un 
expected visitor. Beyond that monosyllabic utter 
ance he could not seem to think of another word to 
say for an instant, so completely was he taken aback. 
But Mr. Campion did not offer to shake hands, 
merely motioning Jimmie, with a smile, to sit on the 
edge of the berth. 

"I am not here in my physical body, so I can't 
shake hands with you, but I am delighted that you 
are able to see so plainly. I have come to take you 
on a little excursion, if you are not afraid to ven 
ture, and as our time is short if you will lie down 
in the berth and fall asleep we will start on our 
travels. ' ' 

Jimmie might have asked a few questions or have 
expressed some misgivings if Mr. Campion had not 
used that expression "If you are not afraid," but 
after that challenge he felt that it would not do for 
an officer in the American army to hold back. So 
he quietly turned off the light, disposed himself 
comfortably in the berth, and in what seemed to 


A DOUGHBOY 's IDEAS ON RELIGION 105 

him almost no time at all found himself standing on 
the floor, looking down upon his recumbent body, 
the whole cabin as plainly visible as though filled 
with daylight, and Mr. Campion, no longer avoiding 
physical contact, standing at his side with one hand 
on Jimmie's shoulder. 

"This is your first conscious leaving of the body, 
and you must not fear that we shall not find the ship 
again or that anything will happen to her while you 
are away. Take my hand and trust me implicitly, 
and whatever you may see do not give way to fear. 
Come." 

They soared away right through the fabric of the 
ship, hovering for a moment above her masts, look 
ing down at her, for she was a beautiful sight as she 
plunged ahead through the smooth, rolling swell, 
plainly visible to their etheric vision. 

Despite the assurances Mr. Campion had given 
him, Jimmie was afraid. There was his body, lying 
down below in its bunk, safe enough perhaps, but 
going one way while he was going another. The 
weather was calm but it was not weather which 
caused the ship to sail at her full speed without a 
light. Suppose a sub — he checked himself . Often 
had Jimmie gone over the top and never had he 
done so without fear, but no one who watched him 
would ever have known that Lieutenant Westman 
was afraid. Jimmie had the true courage to do his 


106 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

duty whether or not he was afraid, to act just as 
though he did not know what fear was, and he had 
heard too many brave men admit constant fear to be 
ashamed of being afraid. But he would have been 
ashamed to show that he was afraid and never had 
he done so. He resolved that this experience should 
never drag from him any expression of the fear he 
really felt, so he turned away from the ship and 
looked his guide full in the face with a smile of 
readiness for anything that might come. 


CHAPTER VII 

HELPING A SLAIN SOLDIER TO COMFORT 
His MOTHER 

MR. Campion turned to him smiling: 
"You have not forgotten the 'glide' I see, so 
well start on our trip." 

They began at once to move with tremendous 
rapidity, Jimmie holding Mr. Campion's hand and 
noticing as they sped along that he seemed to see 
many more people traveling like themselves through 
the air than he had observed on his former visit to 
the Land of the Living Dead. They were moving 
in all directions, some quickly, some slowly, some 
merely drifting and apparently asleep. His own 
gait was so rapid that he merely! made a mental 
note of the fact and hoped to ask Mr. Campion about 
it later. 

In less time than it takes to tell about it they 
found themselves on the fighting line in France, and 
they stopped in front of a little dugout within which 
several men were talking. Jimmie recognized one as 
the tall soldier whom he had met in the "Y" hut. 
It developed from their talk that they expected to 
take part in a drive which they were sure would be 

107 


108 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

made within a day or two, and were discussing the 
conditions of the after-death state, if there were 
such a thing. But they were going about it in a most 
peculiar way — it seemed as though they were try 
ing to hide under a camouflage of flippancy their 
genuine hunger for information. 

One said: 

"I don't believe death ends it all, but it don't 
seen to me like we've been given the right dope 
about it. I remember an old hymn I heard at a re 
vival once. I forget just how it went, but it was 
something like this: 

'One moment here my soul shall be, 
The next, beyond the stars.' 
That's sure going some, aint it?" 

"St. Peter wouldn't have no chance to fire any 
questions at a guy going such a pace as that!" 

"Also the guy would be goin' so fast he'd just 
naturally pass right through heaven an' out the 
other side before he could stop." 

"He'd be out of luck, wouldn't he? But I don't 
believe the man who wrote that song knew anything 
about it. I don't believe people change like that 
when they die. Look at Slim Johnson. That guy 
is so slow he just naturally can 't keep out of his own 
way an' do you think he'd change to a skyrocket 
like that if he was killed? No sir! He'd never show 
no speed like that. It'd take him a week to find it 


HELPING A SLAIN SOLDIER 109 

out. I bet when a man's killed he just hangs 
xound a spell an' then moseys along." 

"Where to?" 

"I dunno. Wherever he had any business, likely. 
Some might like to go to heaven an' play on a harp 
an' then some might not. For me, I never played 
on a harp an' I can't sing so I'd just like to sorter 
hang around an' see how things was goinM" 

"Maybe you couldn't. Supposin' you found you 
had an engagement some place an' a big fellow be 
hind you with a pitchfork urgin' you to keep it?" 

" Nothin ' doin. ' I don't believe in such things as 
that. I don't believe in any devil at all. I've heard 
some of these Englishmen tell of things they seen 
out at night when the war first started an' they 
were different from that." 

The inquisitive soldier with whom Jimmie had 
talked broke inj here: 

"I believe a lieutenant I got talking to a few 
weeks ago had the right dope. He said we had 
lived before and we would live again and that we 
kept on being the same kind of men after we were 
killed as we were before. It seemed foolish to me 
then, but the more I think of it the more I believe 
he was right." 

Here Mr. Campion drew Jimmie away. 

"We have so little time," he said, "that we must 
make the most of it. You see that the seed you 


110 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

planted and which you thought was wasted has really 
sprouted and has started the man to thinking. Later, 
if he should come in touch with the occult teaching, 
it will not be a novelty to him and he will be ready 
to consider it.1' 

They had been moving rapidly while he spoke, 
and he had hardly finished before they stood in a 
room where an elderly couple, evidently man and 
wife, were sitting. The hour was past midnight, 
but for these two there was no sleep. An official 
envelope on the table would have told the story had 
it been needed, but it was not. The woman was 
crying audibly, the man silently, though the tears 
were rolling down his cheeks. Standing at one side 
was a soldier in a torn and muddy uniform, with 
a row of bullet holes across his chest where a ma 
chine gun had evidently done its work. He winced 
and cringed when the woman cried, stretched out 
his arms to her and called her "mother," but she 
did not hear. 

Mr. Campion approached the soldier: 

"Friend," he said, and Jimmie thought that 
never had he heard so kindly a voice. 

The soldier turned to him. 

"I can't make her hear. I can't make her hear. 
If she only knew that I am alive and not — not — suf 
fering! She thinks I'm dead! but I'm not. I'm 


HELPING A SLAIN SOLDIER 111 

just as much alive as I ever was, but I can't make 
her hear!" 

"Friend!" 

Again that gentle voice seemed to change the 
tense vibrations in the room — 

"You are not dead, indeed, but you have laid 
aside your body of flesh and I can help you. Listen 
to me and do exactly as I say: 

"Think of yourself in a clean, new uniform, with 
out a wound and happy, and try to impress that 
thought upon your mother's mind." 

Slowly, as Jimmie looked, the torn, dirty uniform, 
became clean and fresh, the bullet wounds disap 
peared, the man's face lost the lines of pain which 
had been seared upon it. He looked down at him 
self and gave a gasp of surprise. 

"Now," said Mr. Campion, "always think of 
yourself as clean and fresh and happy and keep on 
saying to her 'I love you, I love you!' and after a 
while when she goes to sleep you will be able to talk 
to her for at that time she will leave her body for 
a while. Then try to make her realize that you are 
alive and well and that you love her. Love is the 
greatest force in all the world and in time you will 
soothe her pain; at night when she sleeps you can 
be with her and talk to her." 

The soldier gave him a look only, but in that look 
were manifest a gratitude and respect which no 


112 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

words could have expressed. He began to follow 
the directions. 

Jimmie and Mr. Campion withdrew to a corner 
while the soldier, forcing a smile to his lips, kept 
repeating the formula, bending over the woman as 
she sat sobbing. 

Gradually the sobs died away and a look of peace 
crept over her face. "Henry," she said to her hus 
band, "it is all right with hirn^ I feel it. He is alive 
and well." 

Again Mr. Campion took Jimmie by the hand and 
they began to travel. This time it was back to the 
ship, and Jimmie soon found himself poised directly 
above the vessel on board of which in a little cabin 
his own body lay sleeping quietly. 

The moon had gone down and to the physical eye 
the face of the ocean would have been dark, but 
those who travel in the Land of the Living Dead 
need no sun by day nor are they oppressed by dark 
ness at night. 

Natural laws run through all the cosmos which is 
but another way of saying that God rules every 
where. But the operation of certain natural laws 
differs in the different worlds, and those who find 
themselves suddenly projected into the higher realms 
of being are often apt to be much surprised at the 
things they see and hear. 

Jimmie gazed at the beautiful sight which lay 
spread out below him where the great steamer was 


HELPING A SLAIN SOLDIER 113 

plunging onwards through the gently rolling 
ocean, all around her the interminable stretch of 
waters, ever restless, which ran brimming from 
horizon to horizon with no human eye to watch the 
slow dignity of their great rollers as they heaved 
themselves like mighty giants over the beautiful, 
foamy lacework where the combers broke. 

"Jimmie" said his companion as they hovered 
in the air, "some day perhaps I shall take you on a 
real journey through space and time, and I will 
show you old Atlantis and the things which hap 
pened there long before history had its beginning. 
We read tales of romance and of fiction, but I tell 
you that neither romance nor fiction ever could rival 
some of the wonderful things which happened in 
that strange old land which these very waves have 
traveled over. Now, let us go to your cabin." 

They swept gently downward and entered the cabin 
where Jimmie stood looking down at his body which 
was quietly breathing in sleep. 

"Queer thing, isn't it?" 

"What? asked Mr, Campion. 

"Why, its queer what makes it go! There it is, 
breathing just as regularly as clockwork, and here I 
am, outside of it and disconnected, as you might 
say, and yet it's working just as nicely as ever." 

"The sight of it this way m!ay help you to realize 
that the body is only a tool to be used by the 'you' 

8 


114 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

which is now standing before it. Later on you may 
grow to realize that the 'you' now standing here is 
only the tool of a still higher 'you/ ' 

"I wonder," said Jimmie musingly, "would I 
have known of it if the ship had been torpedoed and 
my body drowned while I was away from it?" 

"You certainly would have known, had it hap 
pened, but it was because I knew that it would not 
happen that I came for you. Later I shall teach you 
to leave your body when you will." 

"Didn't I leave my body tonight?" 

"No. Not as I mean when I speak of leaving the 
body. Everyone leaves the body in sleep. You left 
yours after falling asleep and then I woke you, but 
you did not leave your body consciously. Had you 
done so you would have met the Dweller on the 
Threshhold." 

"What is that?" 

"The sum of your past lives. But there is some 
thing else I want to speak of now instead of the 
Dweller, and that is this: What did you notice 
particularly about the soldier who was trying to make 
his mother hear him?" 

"Why, — er — I don't know. Let us see, he had 
been killed by a machine gun, was that it?" 

"No. I mean what lesson could you draw from 
him? Every time you are taken out on a trip into 
the Land of the Living Dead it is not to gratify your 


HELPING A SLAIN SOLDIER 115 

love for adventure but to teach you a lesson. Every 
time in the future when you are able to 'travel' 
alone you must be on the lookout for some lesson to 
learn. I showed you the inquisitive soldier for a 
purpose, and I took you to the other place also for 
a purpose. 

"After this you will have to search out the lessons 
for yourself, for a great part of the good they do is 
brought about by the trouble which is taken and the 
thought and concentration spent in looking for 
them. But this time, to show you what I mean and 
to start you right, I will help you. 

"You must learn to look for the big little things, 
not for the little big things. You took a wonderful 
journey such as kings might envy you, such as you 
used to read of in fairy stories or in the Arabian 
Nights, a most spectacular thing had there been any 
one to watch it, but that journey was of no import 
ance compared with a number of little things which 
apparently you did not notice. 

"The things which you must look for are 
those which emphasize great truths; things which 
are true for everybody, for all people. The 
journey was great, in its way, but it was great 
for you alone. If you went out into the world and 
spent your time telling people about that wonderful 
journey they would not believe you, but even should 
they believe you, what would you accomplish? From 


116 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

the standpoint of the evolving spirit you would ac 
complish nothing. 

"But take one of the little things which you no 
ticed but which did not impress you for you were 
not on the watch for such things, the little fact that 
the soldier shrank when his mother cried — take that 
fact and ask yourself: Why? Why did he act as 
though some one had struck him with a whip? Was 
it not perfectly natural that she should cry? Had 
she laughed and smiled would he not have had a per 
fect right to have felt badly, to have felt as though 
she was glad to get rid of him? Well, the key lies in 
this: He knew, on account of being more sensitive 
to her thought than when he was in the physical 
body, that she had a subconscious fear that death is 
the end of all and that once dead he was lost to her 
forever. That was what caused him such pain. That 
was why he shrank and quivered so. He was alive 
and he knew he was alive. He was on another plane 
of being, true, but he was alive and not dead. Had 
he been able to tell her so, to show himself to her for 
just one moment as living, she would have lost the 
keeness of her grief, death would have been robbed 
of half its sting, no, more than half, nine tenths. 
There is your lesson, what do you learn from it?" 

Jimmie hesitated, watching his body sleeping in 
the bunk. He was not just sure what the lesson 


HELPING A SLAIN SOLDIER 117 

was. The Elder Brother did not give him long, 
however, for he began again. 

"To find out what the lesson was is easy if you 
will go about it methodically. Take from the situa 
tion the permanent, universal truths. You have a 
son who has been killed, a mother who knows that 
he has been killed; you have the mother showing a 
perfectly natural grief; you have, (since you were 
able to see on both sides of the veil) the natural 
grief of the mother causing the son (unseen by her) 
the most acute sorrow. These things are universal 
as death is universal, for in the problem which we 
are considering, the manner of the son's death is of 
no moment. We have, then, the fact that deep and 
hopeless grief causes the dead to suffer. We have 
also the fact that lamentations for the dead cause 
them pain and take their attention away from the 
new conditions surrounding them, and hence hold 
them back in their evolution. Also, since the pe 
culiar intensity of these lamentations is caused by 
the belief or fear of the living that death is the end 
of everything, you have an utterly needless suffer 
ing, arising from ignorance, which is harming both 
the dead and the living. Is the case growing more 
clear?" 

"Yes, in a way. I can see where grief disturbs 
the dead and how the living suffer much more than 


118 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

they need to suffer and all through ignorance. Is 
that the lesson?" 

''Partly, but only partly. On the other side the 
suffering is much keener than on this side because 
it is not deadened by the flesh, so the dead man suf 
fers far more than is necessary. Also the ones left 
behind suffer a great and needless amount of pain 
because they do not know that death is not the end. 
But there is a positive side. Not only do they suffer 
needlessly but they miss a great deal of joy which 
they might have, did they know the real facts of the 
matter. The mother who mourns her little child, 
could she see the child in the surpassing bliss of the 
heaven world, might still grieve, but her grief would 
be for herself, not for the child. Death is, in many 
cases, a promotion, not a loss; a benefit, a reward, a 
thing for which to be thankful. We need to get rid 
of that old idea which still clings so closely that 
death means permanent cessation of physical ac 
tivity. 

"But there is a further consideration. In the aver 
age death, not the result of sudden accident or of 
battle, the soul reviews the events of the past life, 
and it is this review which forms the real basis of 
our progress in evolution. I explained it to you be 
fore when I gave you that long talk in the Rue de 
TEx. You remember that the subconscious memory, 
which is a property of the vital body, is impressed 


HELPING A SLAIN SOLDIER 119 

on the desire body at death while the soul is review 
ing the past life. That impression forms the basis 
for the life in purgatory and also in heaven. When 
the attention of the passing soul is distracted as 
by the lamentations of those who are left behind, 
the record is not impressed on the desire body, 
hence the purgatory life and the heaven life both 
fail in their real purpose to a large extent, and just 
to that extent the past life of the man is wasted. 
You have seen how the dead are hurt by the grief of 
the living; not the calm sorrow of absence but the 
emotional outburst of despair. This is one lesson 
blocked out for you. In the future, wherever your 
life of service takes you, do all in your power to ex 
plain these facts to people so that in time this ter 
rible injustice to the dead will cease. In just so 
far as you can do this, will you help evolution and 
bring nearer the great Day of Liberation." 

"What was the other lesson of which you spoke?" 

"I have shown you one; the other I think you 
would remember better if you find it out for your 
self." 

"But I don't understand how the subconscious 
memory is impressed. You say that it forms the 
basis for the life in purgatory, and that according 
to the keenness of the life in purgatory so is the 
completeness of our conquest over our sins?" 

"That is it, exactly." 


120 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

"And yet, in the deaths that I have watched from 
this side of the line there has been no review of the 
past life. Take Sergeant Strew, for instance. When 
he was killed he simply stepped out of his body and 
there he was. There was no lamentation, but he 
never stopped to think of his past life. Now why 
was that?" 

"Because it was a departure from the normal way 
of dying. Nature intends to use a method consist 
ing of death, then a review of past activities and 
mistakes and a purgatory and heaven life based on 
that review. That is the scheme of evolution, nor 
mally, but man with his divine prerogative of free 
will and choice often upsets Nature's plans, tem 
porarily, of course. Normally man is not intended 
to die by violence or accident. Death on the battle 
field or death in some accident which suddenly re 
moves the Ego from a young and vigorous body is 
not the normal method planned for the race. It 
interferes with the review. Death by burning, such 
as sometimes happens to people in a house or a rail 
road wreck, may so terrify and excite the soul that 
for a long time after the actual severance of the sil 
ver cord and long after the review has become im 
possible, the soul is still frantically re-enacting the 
scene of its violent separation from the physical 
body. 


HELPING A SLAIN SOLDIER 121 

"In the event of those who die from shell shock 
the review is usually impossible. In the case of Ser 
geant Strew, he was removed from his body in 
stantly and was not aware of the fact, but even had 
he been aware of it, the violence of the vibrations at 
the time would have prevented his review even 
though no relatives interfered. But you will re 
member that he saw you at once and had hardly 
ceased greeting you when he was excited by the sol 
diers interfering with his body. However, even if 
you had not been there he would not have had any 
review on account of the suddenness of what was 
practically accidental death, also the very unfortu 
nate vibrations which obtain generally all over the 
battle line, and several other contributory reasons 
which I won't go into now; but you see that death 
by accident or violence or battle is unfortunate, as 
it interferes with the normal process of Nature. Na 
ture, however, is too powerful to be thwarted. Nat 
ural processes may be interfered with and thrown 
out of normal but they cannot be thwarted in the 
long run. Nature always employs the very abnor 
malities to further her ends, so that when an account 
is finally totaled, it may be seen that what at the 
time seemed to have been a wasted life was really 
not wasted at all, but that every part of it was used. 
So, in our Father's great universe we find the most 


122 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

wonderful evidence of wisdom everywhere, wisdom 
without limit, wisdom whose heights we cannot scale 
and whose depths we cannot plumb. ' ' 

Jimmie was looking at his friend while the latter 
was speaking and saw a sight new to him in his ex 
periences in this wonderful country. He saw the soul 
body of a Master who was wrapped in adoration of 
the Divine Wisdom and in love for the Divine 
Creator. 

Brilliant beyond description was this beautiful 
vision. The little cabin was aflame with the glory 
which filled it with coruscations of intense light in 
many shades from pure white to violet. In the cen 
ter of this terrific radiance was the etheric body of 
the man, standing with bowed head as though in 
prayer. 

Unprepared for such a vision, Jimmie staggered 
back against the wall, and it would have needed but 
little to have brought him to his knees had he not 
remembered the words spoken by the angel under 
somewhat similar circumstances, "See thou do it 
not." So he did not worship, but he stood in awe 
and wonder as the glory began to fade and his own 
friend, familiar once more, looked at him and with 
outstretched hand said: 

"Forgive me, friend. For a moment I was think 
ing only of the Father and His Divine love, His 


HELPING A SLAIN SOLDIER 123 

wonderful forbearance towards us, and the wisdom 
with, which He makes even our weakness and our 
failures serve him. 

"And now I shall leave you for the present. Keep 
up the exercises which I gave you. Seek out the 
other lesson, and as you tread the path may the 
Father's blessing rest upon you." 

Slowly the cabin grew dim and dark, the move 
ment of the vessel became noticeable; Jimmie felt 
the edges of the bunk and the softness of the 
blankets and with his outstretched hand touched the 
hardness of the wall. He was awake. 


CHAPTER VIII 
A STUDY OF AURAS 

JIMMIE slept no more that night. He lay awake, 
pondering over the things which had happened, 
and gradually there came over him the conviction 
that the greatest lesson of all had not been told to 
him but had been left for him to find out for him 
self. 

He began to reason the thing out. Why had he 
been selected and shown so many wonderful things? 
It was not to gratify his curiosity, that was certain. 
It was not that he might here and there pick out 
some one to whom he could bring a moderate degree 
of consolation for the loss of loved ones, although 
that was doubtless one of the minor purposes. 
What could it be, the great idea which lay behind ? 

It was not that he should heal the sick, although 
Mr. Campion had told him a great deal about the 
curing of physical illness by work upon the vital 
body. It was not that he should tell the story of 
his adventures in the Land of the Living Dead, for 
he had been especially warned that he must not do 
this since spiritual experiences will not stand re- 

124 


A STUDY OF AURAS 125 

peating; and besides, he had been told that people 
would not believe him. 

He remembered that the greatest Healer who had 
ever lived, had never, so far as he could recall, gone 
out of His way to heal. He had healed many, it is true, 
but only, as it were, as a side issue, only healing 
those who had obtruded themselves upon Him and 
whose demands had been more or less insistent. Then 
what was he to do? For what great purpose had he 
been instructed? 

Healing was not the great reason, nor comforting 
the sorrowful. Training his own personality as an 
end in itself was out of the question — for that 
would have involved the element of selfishness. It 
must be something which he was to pass on to 
others — that much was clear, and he began to reason 
from analogy. 

Suppose, he thought, he were a wealthy man, 
what could he do with his money in order to accom 
plish most? For one thing, he could give money to 
those in need. But, on the other hand, giving 
money to the needy is not always wise. It is apt to 
breed more troubles than it cures. 

He could build factories and divide the profits 
with his employees. That would be better. That 
would be helping others to help themselves. When 
Christ was on earth He performed nuany miracles, 
and the Power which could multiply a few loaves 


126 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

and fishes until they were enough to feed thousands 
could doubtless have turned stones into gold. Why 
then, did not Christ abolish poverty by giving gold 
to all the poor people whom He met? 

The Christ, he reasoned, looked at the matter from 
the standpoint of the great Sun Spirit that He was. 
He knew these people to be evolving spirits whose 
progress from the pain and unhappiness of the 
lower stages of evolution to the great joy and happi 
ness and splendor of the higher grades, was depend 
ent solely upon spiritual advancement and not in 
any wise upon their accumulation of money or prop 
erty. He knew that spiritual advancement is more 
often retarded by the possessions which, being close 
at hand and prominent, seem to their owner to be 
the most desirable things which life has to offer. 
Therefore He gave them those things which were 
the most valuable — help, encouragement, and teach 
ing along the lines which, if followed, would bring 
the only real and permanent reward. In other 
words, Christ helped His followers to help them 
selves along the lines of spiritual achievement. 

This life, Jimmie realized, taken as a whole from 
the first differentiation of the individual spirit 
within the great being of God before it starts on 
its long pilgrimage, until the final day of liberation 
when the aspirant can speak the glorious words, 
"It is finished/' is like a school, and in it we learn 


A STUDY OF AURAS 127 

our lessons. The same law holds good as in our child 
hood school days, and that is that no one else can 
learn our lessons for us. A teacher can only help 
and encourage, lead and point out the way. The 
actual acquirement of learning must be through 
work done by ourselves. 

True, the child at school can be forced by fear of 
punishment to study; questions and examinations 
can disclose fairly well the extent to which he has 
applied himself. But the punishment or the fear of 
it does not accomplish anything except to spur on 
a careless or lazy mentality. The learning acquired 
is the result of the child's own effort regardless of 
what may have been the incentive 

So, carrying on the analogy, spiritual advance 
ment for the majority of mankind, is the result of 
the spirit's own work, since they are entirely ignor 
ant of the fact that they are in school, ignorant of 
the law of spiritual growth, hence devoid of incen 
tive. 

The education of a child who will study only un 
der the threat of punishment is of very poor quality 
compared with that obtained by one who knows that 
it is receiving a training which will help it to get on 
in the world and who consequently tries to study 
and assist the teacher. But this education, although 
far surpassing the first, makes a poor showing com 
pared with that obtained by the child who has a 


128 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

real thirst for knowledge and who needs neither the 
lash of fear nor the spur of self-interest to urge it 
on. 

So with spirtual growth. At first it is fostered 
by fear — fear of death, of eternity, and all the other 
fears which operate on mankind. 

This stage of spiritual growth is excessively slow, 
life after life showing but little gain. When self- 
interest becomes the motive, progress is a little more 
rapid. It is, however, only when self is forgotten 
and the man works for love alone that progress is 
swift. Then he has reached the stage described in 
the parable of the Prodigal Son who, being yet a 
great way off, was seen by the Father who went to 
meet him. 

Jimmie pondered these things carefully. The 
great purpose was not healing nor consolation. These 
were by-products, so to speak. The great purpose 
must be connected with helping people to help them 
selves. The key to the problem evidently lay hidden 
there. 

Now, how was he to help others to help them 
selves? Spiritual advancement can come like educa 
tion, only through the spirit's own efforts. But 
achievement, when made only under the spur of 
the law of compensation and when the result is not 
incorporated into the spirit until after death, is 
very slow. 


A STUDY OF AURAS 129 

The child at school, even if unwilling to learn, 
can see and understand the geography or the spell 
ing book whose lists of names and words it is re 
quired to memorize. The spirit learning under the 
lash of the great Twin Laws does not understand 
but is learning blindly. 

A knowledge of the laws of Rebirth and Conse 
quence would be a great aid to many. It would 
show them what they were going and why they were 
doing it, and in a great number of cases it would 
accelerate spiritual progress wonderfully. 

Jimmie felt that this was not the real answer to 
his problem, but he also felt that it was a start to 
ward that answer, and he was sure that it he should 
do his best to spread the knowledge which he had 
gained — not the details of his adventures, but the 
great fact that a tremendous and wonderful spirit 
ual life is going on around us all the time, and that 
at death we merely step out of our physical cocoon 
into a glorious freedom — if he should do his best to 
spread this knowledge and that of the great Twin 

Laws, he would later be given his real answer. 

* # # 

At the training camp to which he had been as 
signed Jimmie soon plunged into his work with 
earnestness. It was not hard work as yet, for his 
superiors had consideration for his physical condi 
tion, and made things as easy for him as they 

9 


130 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

could. In fact he had had one entire week after 
landing with nothing at all to do, and he spent that 
week getting acquainted with the city near which 
his camp was located. He had thought of visiting 
his home, but the leave given him was not quite long 
enough and he was unable to get it extended. 

Walking around this unfamiliar city, he amused 
himself and practiced his newly budding powers by 
watching the auras of the people whom he met, not 
the people with whom he became acquainted, for 
Mr. Campion had been very particular to point out 
that it was forbidden to any occult student to in 
vestigate the auric colors of any person whom he 
might personally know. Such investigation must 
be concerned only with strangers and those with 
whom it was not at all likely that an acquaintance 
would ever be made. 

It had not been long that he had been able to see 
the aura, and at first he had not realized what it 
was but supposed that he was affected in some way 
by shell shock. When first he had glimpsed the 
lightly changing colors which come and go around 
the head and shoulders, he had thought his eyes 
affected. Marjorie had told him of auras, and he 
had seen the color around the head of his nurse 
when first recovering consciousness, but somehow or 
other these impressions had been too vague. When 
he actually saw the real thing after the first glamour 


A STUDY OF AURAS 131 

of the life behind the veil had worn away, he did 
not recognize it. 

He had first seen it in the trenches. A number of 
new men had been assigned to his company when 
returned to the front, and he had been watching 
one of these men, when a well aimed shell of small 
caliber had whizzed very close above the top of the 
parapet and near where this man was standing. The 
man did not move nor did he exclaim but stood as 
calmly as though he had been a veteran of twenty 
years of trench warfare. But to Jimmie, watching 
him, he appeared suddenly to be enveloped in a 
cloud of gray as in a fog. This was modified by 
considerable scarlet around the head, which showed 
that the man was afraid but that it was the fear of 
a brave man, for he was angry too, partly at him 
self, for being afraid. It showed, too, that while the 
man felt fear, yet he was in perfect control of him 
self and would not allow himself to show it; thus he 
proved himself, to Jimmie, to be one of the bravest 
of the brave. 

This first glimpse which Jimmie had of the aura 
was not a very clear one. He had the impression 
that his eyes had suddenly clouded a little with 
moisture which, he thought, might explain the gray 
mist, but the appearance of scarlet had puzzled 
him. For several days he had no recurrence of the 
sight, but after that it had come more and more fre- 


132 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

quently, especially after he had recognized it for 
what it was and had begun to practice the use of it. 
Later still he found that he could look at men and 
determine whether they were afraid or not, whether 
they were angry or not and to just what degree. 

And still later he had begun to tell the difference 
between the aura and the vital body, which he had 
not been able to distinguish at first except that he 
knew the aura to be considerably outside the vital 
body in its extent. 

During his voyage he had exercised his budding 
power on the members of the crew and those with 
whom he was sure he would not be thrown into 
companionship later. This had been unsatisfactory, 
however, for the members of the crew did not dis 
play much variation in their auric coloring, and the 
colors they did have were generally of a muddy and 
confused variety. Even when they had little 
bickerings among themselves, they never showed the 
pure scarlet but only a muddy, dirty red, consider 
ably mixed with other colors. 

Here in the city, however, it was different. There 
were plenty of people who showed only the unde 
veloped colors, it was true, but there were some 
whom he saw on the street whose auras were beauti 
ful. He visited a church the first Sunday morning, 
thinking that there at least he would find the higher 
shades of the rarer colors, but was disappointed. 


A STUDY OF AURAS 133 

The most beautiful shade of blue he witnessed was 
that unconsciously owned by a little old lady who 
would, no doubt, have been very much surprised had 
some one told her that she was more spiritual than 
the minister himself. 

Often on the street Jimmie would see a well 
dressed business man with a most kindly and benevo 
lent expression yet with an aura which denoted 
greed, envy, lust, cruelty, and he would wonder 
what such a man would do in a world where such 
things were visible to all. If we can keep our self- 
respect here only by making others believe we are 
what we are not, although possibly trying to be the 
latter, then in a world where the character is an 
open book to all who care to read, what shall we 
do? Obviously it is "up to us" to lay the founda 
tions of character of which we shall not be ashamed 
when it is visible to all. 

Jimmie made a mental note that the driving home 
of this truth was one of those things which it was 
intended he should accomplish. Perhaps it was part 
of his answer. 


CHAPTER IX 

AN EXPERIENCE WITH NATURE SPIRITS 

IN a kind of waking dream passed the next few 
months of Jimmie's life, a life made very busy 
by the demands of his work and tinctured by a curi 
ous feeling that something was soon to happen, a 
feeling of uneasiness, of waiting, of suspense. He 
wrote to Louise regularly and received answers 
which were apparently satisfactory, to judge by the 
number of times that he read and re-read each letter. 
In his "sleep life," which was becoming more and 
more distinct and real, he was developing rapidly. 

Every night he slipped the cable and soared out 
into the great world which lies unseen about us, and 
every time he did so he was more deeply impressed 
with the wondrous exaltation which the "astom- 
phere" of that world produces. 

Much of this, of course, it is impossible to describe 
for the reason that it is not to be communicated by 
language, much less by the printed word. I can 
think of only one way in which my meaning can be 
made clear to those who read this little story. Did 
you ever have a very vivid dream in which you went 
through some most delightful experience or adven- 

134 


AN EXPERIENCE WITH NATURE SPIRITS 135 

ture? Can you not remember, in a faint and very 
imperfect way, the wonderful "atmosphere" of that 
fairy country which you dreamed you visited? Can 
you not recall how, when you tried to describe your 
dream, your words were so very cold and colorless? 
Can you not remember that the great thing which 
made you so enthusiastic about that dream was not 
so much the adventure itself as it was the strange, 
wonderful, tingling glamour of the thing? Glamour 
is not the right word but, as I said, there is no word 
in our language to hint at, far less to describe, the 
strange, exhilarated feeling which one has in that 
beautiful country. It is a feeling which must be ex 
perienced to be realized. It can never be portrayed 
to one who has never felt it. A man born blind can 
listen to your words of description of the beauty 
of color and the splendor of the sunset, but to him 
your words mean nothing. You speak of a "riot of 
color" when you have in mind some wonderful exhi 
bition of atmospheric coloring in the western sky 
as the sun sinks to rest. 

The blind man knows what a riot is and he has an 
academic idea of what color is, but of the combina 
tion, which is so clear in your mind, he has and can 
have no conception whatever. 

So, to those of us who are not able to visit those 
glorious regions, the description of them seems cold. 
And, what is more unfortunate, the actions which 


136 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

are based upon familiarity with those regions and 
their laws seem foolish. 

It is but another verification of the Biblical state 
ment that ' ' the wisdom of God is foolishness to men. ' ' 
"We are yet so steeped in selfishness, even those of 
us who most pride ourselves upon our unselfishness, 
that when we come face to face with real wisdom 
we are like the man in the parable, " speechless. " 

The morning and evening exercises Jimmie kept 
up faithfully, for he had now come to see the phil 
osophy of them, and he felt ever more and more their 
tremendous effect. He had long ago quit smoking 
and meat eating. These departures of his were a never 
ending source of wonder to his comrades, who could 
not understand why any sane person should quit 
eating meat except, possibly, to cure rheumatism, 
while the giving up of tobacco could be accounted 
for by only one word, "fanaticism." 

He liked to attend church, not only for the strong 
spiritual vibrations which were present in the 
church, but also to practice reading the colors in 
the various auras. The minister of the church to 
which he usually went thought that his sermons 
were the main attraction and took Jimanie's regular 
attendance as, in part, a compliment to himself. But 
Jimmie knew, as every occultist knows, that on Sun 
day the vibrations all over the land are different and 
vastly better than on week days. Jimmie had in 


AN EXPERIENCE WITH NATURE SPIRITS 137 

some of his excursions visited savage lands and had 
watched the various savage religious rites, and he 
was in a position to compare the vibration there to 
the vibrations which were prevalent over his own 
country on a Sunday. The tremendous contrast im 
pressed upon him the fact that the western race is 
on the eve of something ' ' different. ' ' 

As the time passed on in work and drill, in various 
social activities, and in his more and more absorb- 
inly interesting occult development, the terrible Rus 
sian debacle began to feature more and more in the 
news of the day and in the thoughts and words of 
men. Something of it Jimmie was able to watch at 
times when he made excursions during his sleeping 
hours. But he was hampered greatly by the fact 
that he had not as yet learned how to leave his body 
consciously, and so he was not in the full possession 
of choice as to where his wanderings would lead him. 
Generally, if he made up his mind strongly before 
he went to sleep, he could determine the locality of 
his visit, but to do this required interest in it and 
as on the occasions when he had visited the country 
of the former Czar he had not been able to under 
stand a single thing which he had heard, this inter 
est was more or less mild when compared with 
the intense longing to spend his time on the battle 
line with his old comrades, now and then helping one 
of them across to the other side of death. 


138 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

The question which will occur to many at this 
time, a perfectly natural question, is this: Why did 
not Jimmie use his newly found power to visit 
Louise, since he was really in love with her and cor 
responded with her? 

The reason was a two-fold one. In the first place, 
Jimmie came of gentle people, and his boyhood train 
ing had been such that it would have been impossible 
for him to have used any occult power to spy upon 
his sweetheart. The other reason, which would have 
operated had the first not been his guiding impulse, 
was the warning which Mr. Campion had strongly 
impressed upon him that the occult law will not per 
mit the use of occult power for any motive of curi 
osity. 

When any one is developing the ability to see 011 
the other planes and to travel in "foreign coun 
tries," he must have practice, and to that end he is 
allowed to watch the auras and the play of auric 
colors about strangers; he is allowed to travel and 
examine distant lands and to watch people and their 
lives bat only to do so for the purpose of study and 
practice. Abuse of spiritual power brings its own 
peculiar and terrible punshiment. But aside from 
any dread of punishment it would have been utterly 
foreign and abhorrent to Jimmie 's nature to have at 
tempted to spy upon his sweetheart. The idea never 
occurred to him, for he was, above and beyond all 
else, a gentleman. 


AN EXPERIENCE WITH NATURE SPIRITS 139 

The one remaining way of honorably communicat 
ing with her by means of sending out a call on the 
higher planes he had promised not to do, since she 
was busy all the time and her sleep was taken when 
she could get it instead of at regular intervals. Had 
he called her she would have come, but the call might 
have been sounded just at a time when her attention 
was needed for some critical operation — it might, 
possibly, have cost a life. So Jimmie had promised 
and being a gentleman, he loyally kept that promise. 
Therefore his only means of communication was by 
the same post upon which all the rest of American 
sweethearts had to depend. 

But no such rule applied in the case of Marjorie. 
In that case he was at liberty to call when he got 
upon the other side, and in a very little while Mar 
jorie would come dancing up, full of gayety and 
happiness, and the two would embark upon a long 
"glide," sometimes half around the world. 

It was Marjorie who introduced him to the nature 
spirits with whom she was a prime favorite, and 
Jimmie made the acquaintance of the elves and the 
Brownies and even the fairies themselves. He learned 
that there are many more tribes of these strange 
creatures, some of whom avoid man as much as pos 
sible while some are actively hostile to him. 

As a rule, those whom, he met in his wanderings 
were gentle, timid folk, or gentle even if not timid. 


140 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

He grew to be very fond of the Brownies in partic 
ular, whom he could always meet in out of the way 
forest countries. He loved to talk and play with 
them, and they grew to love him too, for they are of 
a rather affectionate nature but distrustful of men, 
since the vibrations of the average man are very 
coarse and unpleasant to a being of sensitive nature. 

The fairies were harder to know, but with the help 
of Marjorie he made many friends among them, who 
used to visit him sometimes when he was out alone 
in the woods. 

This phase of his extra-physical life was full of 
adventure and was like one long fairy story, but I 
am mentioning it now for a single purpose and that 
is to show what a tremendous dynamo of energy is 
the human will. 

Jimmie had few holidays, but once in a while he 
was able to get away from the camp and plunge into 
the woods, which he could reach after a very short 
railway journey. He liked to go out into the forest 
for the reason that is was here the little people were 
to be found, and after they discovered the fact that 
he was harmless to them they used to flock around 
him whenever they caught him wandering alone, and 
together they had a merry time. 

It was on one of these trips that he had not gone 
far into the woods when he was aware of something 
wrong with the vibrations in the ether. He heard no 
one calling, but somehow he knew that there was 


AN EXPERIENCE WITH NATURE SPIRITS. 141 

trouble at hand, and he set about to find it. It was 
only a few minutes after first sensing the etheric dis 
turbance that he saw in a little glade one of his 
Brownie friends trying to defend himself against the 
attacks of five most loathsome beings. I shall not at 
tempt to describe them beyond saying that they were 
apparently semi-human, semi- animal. Evidently they 
were not of the harmless type of nature spirits, for 
the little Brownie was having a hard time of it. He 
was not fighting with any weapon but would make 
motions at the creatures, and as he did so they would 
shrink back, much as though he had struck them. At 
once, however, they would recover and press in on 
him again, and Jimmie knew, though this was his 
first experience of the sort, that he was witnessing 
a combat on the etheric plane. 

As he came up the Brownie tried to break through 
the circle, but he was evidently weakened in some 
way, and three of the creatures blocked him and 
drove him back. 

They did not touch the Brownie nor did the 
Brownie touch them, yet in some way or other the 
contact was a most practical one since Jimmie could 
tell by his little friend's movements that he was much 
distressed and that the odds were too great against 
him. 

There was not the slightest hesitation in Jimmie 's 
action. Never before had he seen such a thing as a 


142 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

fight upon this plane of being, but he did know that 
there was such a thing as a contest between different 
sets of forces. Evidently it was some such thing 
which he was witnessing now and he knew why the 
little Brownie was getting the worst of it. 

On the other plane a contest is a contest, not of 
blows or of what would correspond to physical force, 
but of the will. It is not entirely of the will either. 
For instance, a number of evilly inclined spirits may 
be tormenting another, yet when one of the "Mas 
ters" happens by and puts a stop to the affair, he 
does not do so by physical force nor yet by a supreme 
exercise of a stronger will, though of course he has 
stronger will. His power to stop the cruelty is the 
result of a stronger will combined with the fact that 
his higher position in the scale of being has given 
him an aura whose vibrations are so strong that a 
being whose vibrations are less good or positively 
evil, simply cannot endure the higher vibratory rate 
of the Master's presence. This is an extreme instance, 
of course, but it holds good on all planes of nature 
where the higher vibrations can be felt, and it would 
act with full power on the physical plane except the 
the fact that the higher vibrations here are so dulled 
by the flesh that they lose their force and can only 
act slowly. It reminds one strongly of a line in a 
hymn which says, "Where Thou art present, evil 
cannot be," and the statement holds true in all cases 


AN EXPERIENCE WITH NATURE SPIRITS 143 

where good is brought into contact with evil, the 
effect varying with the degree of difference between 
the intensity of the good and the intensity of the 
evil. 

Now the Brownies are a gentle, likable, little race, 
but they are nature spirits, and while innocent and 
sensitive to a great degree, their innocence is not the 
result of a positive and long drawn out fight against 
temptation, but is more like the innocence of child 
hood, and therefore is not a source of power. They 
are remarkably like little children in many ways, 
with a child's affection and a child's intuitive likes 
and dislikes but with a good deal of a child's help 
lessness against aggression. 

So this little Brownie, who was so bravely fighting 
against terrible odds, did not have the strength which 
would have been his had he been the product of a 
long evolution of physical plane suffering and train 
ing. He was like a little, helpless child, striking 
bravely but futilely against a pack of wolves who are 
restrained only because they think him to be stronger 
than he is. 

Such was the state of affairs when Jimmie came 
upon the scene. A sharp exclamation burst from 
him and in a few strides he stood by the Brownie 
and faced the loathsome elementals who were attack 
ing him. Jimmie merely looked at them, pointed, 
said "Go", and used his imagination and will to 


144 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

sweep them together and disintegrate them. They 
leered horribly at him and mouthed and gibbered, 
but the human will, the result of long evolution, 
was too strong for them and they simply faded from 
sight like a vanishing picture on the screen. 

The Brownie had fallen in a heap when Jimmie 
took the fight off his hands, but recuperative power 
on the etheric plane is rapid, and the elementals had 
hardly disappeared when he sprang up and with one 
bound threw himself into Jimmie 's arms and clung 
to him, sobbing incoherently for all the world like a 
child; and since his height was only about eighteen 
inches, it is not to be wondered at that Jimmie had 
the same feeling which one would have after rescuing 
a child from a vicious dog. 

This was the first time that a Brownie had ever 
touched him, for they are a shy little people. But 
now that his friendship was proved, this one 
Brownie, at any rate, clung to him and caressed his 
cheek and stroked his hair and kept repeating: 

"Jimmie, my friend; Jimmie, my friend." 

They walked on for a few minutes, and since the 
Brownie weighed nothing, being an etheric entity, 
Jimmie simply held him as he would have held a 
child and tried to soothe him gently and help him re 
cover from his fright. Thus they were situated when 
a whole troop of the little people came dancing out 
of the denser forest and spied them. 


CHAPTER X 
A CRISIS IN LOVE 

WHEN the band of Brownies spied the most 
unheard of sight which greeted them as they 
swept out of the cover of the woods and came face 
to face with Jimmie holding his little Brownie friend 
in his arms, they showed signs of greatest excite 
ment. 

Very naturally and just as human beings might 
do, they jumped to the conclusion that at least one 
Brownie had turned traitor to his race and kindred. 
They surrounded Jimmie at a respectful distance 
and began to shout to his little companion in their 
own language, which Jimmie recognized since it was 
a sort of universal language, but still he could not 
tell what they were saying. 

His little friend understood, however, and showed 
the most unmistakable tokens of distress. Finally, 
the accusations becoming too harsh for his endur 
ance, he leaped out of Jimmie 's arms and ran 
straight for the Brownie who seemed to be the leader 
of the band. He then began an explanation of the 
occurrence. Jimmie could follow him quite well al- 

145 

10 


146 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

though he talked faster than any Frenchman he had 
ever heard. The little fellow's powers of gesticula 
tion were wondejrful. 

Acted out before him and accompanied by the 
most rapid verbal performance to which he had ever 
listened, Jimmie saw the whole adventure. The little 
Brownie would have made an incomparable actor 
could he have been enticed upon a stage and given 
a more material body. The surprise by the horrible 
elementals; the desperate seeking for some way to 
escape; the tremendous fight, and the awful weari 
ness which was fast giving way to the certainty of 
death ; the mouthings and grimaces of the hostile cir 
cle around him, and the despair which overcame him 
when each attempt at escape was blocked; then the 
tremendous relief when suddenly this great giant of 
a human being with that terrible human will power 
stood at his side and took his part in the unequal 
struggle. 

"You see," the Brownie shrieked at last, "It is 
all right. He is my friend. You see!" 

Here his enthusiasm overcame him, and with one 
tremendous leap he landed squarely on Jimmie 's 
shoulder and began to jump from one shoulder to 
the other, every now and then giving Jimmie 's head 
a friendly kick as he passed over it. This, since he 
was an etheric entity, did not give Jimmie any incon 
venience and seemed to amuse the crowd of Brownies 
immensely. 


A CRISIS IN LOVE 147 

They crowded in a little closer, and Jimmie was 
aware of the change in their attitude by the friendli 
ness of their glances, the frequent smiles with 
which they greeted him, and the bantering manner 
in which they spoke to his active little friend. 

As a general thing the vibrations of the human 
race are offensive to the little people for the reason 
that most human beings, on account of their habit 
ual line of thinking and acting, have built into their 
etheric bodies most undesirable etheric matter. 

To a great extent this also holds true of their desire 
bodies, and as the Brownies are on the borderland 
between the two kingdoms, they are affected very 
adversely thereby. 

Jimmie did not know exactly what to do so he did 
the most natural thing possible, he sat down on a 
log and stretched his feet out in front of him. One 
of the bolder of the Brownies after several feints 
took a running start and jumped over his feet, giv 
ing one of them a little touch with his foot as he 
passed over. Finding that he was still unhurt he 
jumped again, thjs time landing on Jimmie 's foot 
and immediately jumping away again. 

Meantime a number of them had come up beyond 
reach of his arms and were discussing him in their 
queer little high-pitched voices, while he felt many 
touches on his back and little tweaks at his belt and 
blouse. This was entirely possible even though the 
little folk were not on the physical plane. The seem- 


148 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

ing incongruity did not occur to Jimmie until some 
time afterward, for when we see that a thing is really 
true we are very prone to accept the fact without 
question, never stopping to consider that according 
to all theory and reason the fact ought to be a fancy 
only. 

"Say, Buster," Jimmie spoke to the little Brownie 
whom he had saved from the elementals, "What's 
the matter with your friends? They seem to be 
afraid of me. Tell them/ I won't hurt them." 

"Oh, they're foolish! They're afraid. You won't 
hurt. You're a friend." 

He began an impassioned harangue in his own 
language with the result that three Brownies came 
and sat on Jimmie 's leather leggings, while some 
others came within reach of his arm but stood as 
though ready to jump at a moment's notice. 

Jimmie sat perfectly still, not moving a muscle 
except that he kept talking to "Buster", whose 
name he asked in vain as the little fellow seemed to 
be proud of the name Jimmie himself had carelessly 
bestowed, and to every inquiry returned the state 
ment that "Buster" was his name and he knew no 
other. 

Gradually the talk and Buster's assurances had 
their effect, and the rest of the Brownies began to 
lose their fear of the big human being who had saved 
their comrade from so awful a fate. They drew 


A CRISIS IN LOVE 149 

nearer and showed more interest in the conversation, 
and Jimmie took advantage of the fact to ask Buster 
what would have happened to him had the ele- 
mentals won the fight. He was uncertain whether 
death was a possibility to any being who had no 
physical body, but the great relief and gratitude 
which Buster had evinced made it clear that an ad 
verse outcome of the combat would at least have 
been highly disagreeable to the Brownie. 

But Buster hated to think of what would have 
happened. He did not, apparently, like to use his 
imagination. Like a child intent on play he was im 
patient of any attempt to make him think seriously, 
and only cared for his play and the particular sport 
upon which he happened to be engaged. Irresponsi 
bility seemed to be the keynote of his make-up, and 
concentration upon any particular thing, unless he 
happened to be interested in it, was irksome to him. 
Jimmie finally gave up the attempt and turned his 
attention to making friends with the rest of the 
band. 

In this he was successful for the Brownies soon 
lost all their fear of him and came within reach of 
his arms without watching him to forestall any 
possible hostile movement. 

" Buster/' said Jimmie at length, "tell me why 
your people were afraid of me. What harm can I 
do them?" 


150 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

"You see," squeaked Buster, "your will power. 
It is so strong. That is why. They did not know as 
I know." 

It took a great many questions to elicit the reason 
for the Brownies' shyness, but Buster, with the help 
of others who took a hand in the conversation, finally 
enlightened Jimmie as to the cause of the disinclina 
tion which his people have towards association with 
mortals. 

It seems that not only are the human vibrations 
usually very disagreeable to the Brownies, but the 
human will power is so strong that when it is intelli 
gently directed, they are often unable to resist it. 
This makes them afraid of the neighborhood of men, 
for some human beings are gifted with a slight clair 
voyance and it frequently happens that the clairvoy 
ant ones are not the most advanced members of the 
race. Thus a low grade mortal with a little clairvoy 
ant power can make himself very disagreeable to 
the Brownies. 

Also it developed that to touch a human being 
gives that being in some mysterious way an added 
power of being disagreeable, should he so choose. 
From this Jimmie could see why the Brownies were 
so horrified when they first saw Buster riding in 
his arms and on such friendly terms with him. 

By this time all reserve was thrown to the winds 
and the whole Brownie band were reveling in their 


A CRISIS IN LOVE 151 

acquaintance with a man. They climbed all over 
him, they stood on his head and jumped over his 
feet, and it was with considerable difficulty that 
Jimmie could get one to stop in his play and answer 
any questions. It was as though their intelligence 
made them somewhat like a very young child — able 
to talk and to understand simple language but wholly 
incapable of any mental effort beyond that of a six 
or seven year old. But, like children, their love and 
trust, once given, were without reserve. 

So Jimmie spent a pleasant afternoon with his lit 
tle friends until a near approach of some berry pick 
ers alarmed them, and they scampered off into the 
forest after making him promise another visit. He had 
come to the conclusion that any real information to 
be obtained about them must be derived from some 
other source than themselves. It was the first time 
that he had been brought into contact with nature 
spirits or elementals, and he resolved to find out 
more about them since it was evident that in meeting 
them he had glanced into another one of the man 
sions of our Father's House, which is so full of 
wonders. 

The Brownies having gone, he started for home, 
walking slowly and reviewing in his mind the things 
he would put in his next letter to Louise and think 
ing a little, too, of how happy he would be when 
she should come home again and when the war should 


152 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

be over and peace declared. He would have to work 
hard to make up for lost time and earn the money 
for the little home which he wanted so much. And 
the great work must not be forgotten either, for he 
would have to plan some way to reach the great 
mass of people who are so hungry for every little 
crumb of spiritual knowledge, and who are often 
fed with pebbles instead of crumbs. After all, the 
world was a fine place to live in for one who was will 
ing to work, and he began to feel the thrill of joy 
which is the reward of every earnest worker, and from 
which one may imagine the bliss which is the part 
of the great Brothers of the Light, who spend their 
energy to serve mankind and who renounce the rest 
and peace of heaven itself in order to serve. 

He walked back to the train in a sort of dream, 
so fascinated was he in the hopes and plans which 
he had made and the castles in the air which he had 
built. And through it all there ran that dangerous 
thread of vanity, which so often insinuates itself in 
the place of other and grosser forms of evil which 
we m&y have managed to throw out. He was not 
conscious that it was vanity, but had he stopped to 
analyze, he would have known that his dreams were 
all based on what he would do and on the service 
which he would perform, and there was lacking that 
one great mark of the devoted worker, namely, a 


A CRISIS IN LOVE 153 

thankfulness to the Master for giving him oppor 
tunity to serve. ? 

It is the subtle difference between the laudable 
joy of service and the unjustifiable pride of service 
which often makes our deposits in the heavenly 
treasure house of humble silver instead of kingly 
gold. 

But Jimmie was unconscious of this sinister 
thread which ran through the warp and woof of 
his dreams. He dwelt on the happiness which he 
hoped would be his and, too, on the possibility 
that he might be able to get back to France before 
the "show" was over, for he coveted one of the 
valor medals and meant to get one if he had to 
capture a whole German army single-handed. Here 
he could not help smiling at himself for his imagina 
tion was presenting him with pictures of himself 
driving ahead of him a whole company of ' ' Fritzies, ' ' 
and with the smile he came back to earth again. 

It was a happy and enthusiastic Jimmie who en 
tered his quarters that evening, singing a song 
which had been one of the trench favorites and liter 
ally bubbling over with hope and irresponsibility. 
And there upon his table lay a letter from France, 
from Louise. 

He snatched it quickly and felt a slight wonder 
that is was so thin, but the wonder was only a semi- 


154 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

conscious one as he tore the envelope open in his 
eagerness to know what she had to say. 

His face changed as he read the first few lines, 
and the letter fluttered from his hand. He said 
nothing but presently went and leaned his head 
against the wall. In a little while he came back and 
picked up the letter from the floor and read it 
again. It was cruelly short. 

"Dear Mr. Westman," it ran, "I am about to sail 
for home on the next convenient steamer and write 
to tell you not to send any more letters to France 
for me. On thinking it over I am convinced that 
our engagement was not the result of a sufficiently 
long acquaintance, so I release you and think that 
it would be better to let the matter end there. I 
shall not expect any more letters from you, and I 
trust that you will regard my wishes in the matter 
and forget that I ever entered your life. With best 
wishes for your future happiness, etc." 

Jimmie felt stunned. The other letters he had 
had from Louise were generally short, for she was 
worked almost to death and he knew it and made 
allowance for it, but in those short letters, almost 
notes, she had never before given expression to a 
word of regret for the engagement into which they 
had entered. All sorts of reasons flashed through 
his mind only to be rejected as unworthy of himself 
or Louise. ? 


A CRISIS IN LOVE 155 

Perhaps she bad met some one whom she loved 
better. That was a possibility, he admitted to him 
self, but would not explain the curtness and abrupt 
ness of the letter. Perhaps she had — Oh! He could 
not believe that she really wrote what was in her 
mind. Yet, if she did not write what was in her 
mind, why should she write at all? She was not com 
pelled to write. There was no law which forced her 
to write. She surely could not be angry for she 
knew very well that he had been compelled to obey 
his orders and that he had not left France willingly. 
This was war time, orders were orders, and Louise 
knew that as well as he, for she had been up near 
the front where men were dying every day on ac 
count of these same "orders." 

The more he thought the matter over the more 
he found that his love for Louise was a very deep 
and strong feeling. Well could he remember the 
kindly, gentle nursing, the little things she had done 
for him when he was helpless, how she had gone 
without some of the sleep she needed so badly in 
order to read to him when the shellshock nervous 
ness came over him. Once when he had lain there, 
in no great pain it is true, yet almost screaming 
from the horror of those jagged nerves, she had sat 
by him with her hand on his forehead, soothing him 
with little verses of poetry, snatches of hymns, any 
thing that she could remember, to steady his mind 
and take his thoughts away from that strange, pe- 


156 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

culiar condition which is the result of shell shock and 
which is always different. 

And then, after he was well — oh shucks! letter or 
no letter, he would not believe what she had written 
until she had confirmed it with her own spoken 
words. He would find her and learn from her own 
lips. 

It was characteristic of Jimmie that in all the ex 
cuses and reasons and explanations which he had 
threshed over in his mind, never once had he thought 
of Louise discarding him for any financial reasons. 
It was as fine and noble a tribute as he could have 
laid at the feet of this golden girl of his, that all the 
reasons which he could imagine for her action took 
the form of a fear that in some way he had not 
measured up to the high standard which she had set 
for him, or that he had unwittingly offended her in 
some way, but never once did he dream of a low or 
base, mercenary motive on her part. Could she 
have known this, it would surely have melted her 
heart towards him, but Jimmie himself, was as un 
conscious of the matter as she was ; to ascribe an un 
worthy motive to her letter simply had never oc- 
cured to him. 

He knew the little town where her home was. He 
figured that on account of the slowness of the postal 
service from France, she had probably reached this 
country some time ahead of her letter, and the 
chances were that she was even now at home. The 


A CRISIS IN LOVE 157 

thought set him tingling, and he made up his mind 
that he simply must get a week's furlough and fol 
low the matter to the end. 

But furloughs are not easy to get in time of war. 
He knew it would take at least a day to reach her 
home and a day to get back, and he wanted a day 
there. If connections were bad, it might well take 
longer, so he decided to ask for a week. 

That night as he fell asleep he determined to 
sound a call for Marjorie, and sure enough, when 
he awoke in the now familiar conditions of the De 
sire World, he became conscious that Marjorie was 
coming. So he was not surprised at all when the 
young lady herself, laughing and evidently in the 
best of spirits, stood before him. 

Jimmie at once began to tell the story of his woes 
in the hope that Marjorie would sympathize with 
him and offer to help him, but he had reckoned 
without his hostess for all she did was to laugh at 
him. If those of us who regard the other world as 
a place of funereal gloom and despair and hopeless 
ness could have looked on at that little scene, how 
much of the dread of death would we have lost. 

Marjorie was dead. This girl had been torn from 
her family by that ruthless King of Terrors, and ac 
cording to all the generally accepted beliefs she 
should have been anything but what she really was 
— happy, joyous with the pure joy of living — 
happy conditions in which she lived, freed from all 


158 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

the cramping necessities of physical life, pain, weari 
ness, the ten thousand little things which never rise 
above the threshold of consciousness but which in 
their aggregate amount to a continuous discomfort; 
and above all, happy because not separated from her 
family, although they were separated from her. 

This apparently anomalous condition arose from 
the fact that every night she could meet them on the 
desire plane, talk to them, and "visit" with them; 
although they were unable to carry back the memory 
of these meetings, she was under no such limitation. 
So it was really true that all the separation was on 
their side, not on hers. Hence there is nothing to 
be wondered at in her happiness, for why should she 
not be happy? 

But Jimmie thought she was entirely too happy. 
He, himself, was miserable or thought he was, and 
he needed sympathy. Also, though he had not ad 
mitted it to himself, he hoped that Mar jorie would 
tell him something about Louise and why she had 
acted so. He felt that Mar jorie must know. It 
would not be right to ask, but perhaps she would 
volunteer a few words of comfort. This thought 
of Jimmie 's did not escape Marjorie for a moment, 
and it was what she was laughing at. Jimmie had 
come to have an idea that he was of considerable im 
portance, and there was a lesson on the subject due 
him. 


CHAPTER XI 

LIGHT AGAIN 

JIMMIE was looking for sympathy. He was 
really feeling that he had been rather badly 
used, and he had sounded a call for Marjorie with a 
hazy idea that perhaps she could tell him why Louise 
had acted in such an extraordinary manner. In the 
finer realms, knowledge does not always have to be 
acquired in the same way that we obtain it in the 
physical world, but the advanced soul can very often 
know things by merely turning his attention to 
them. 

Jimmie was well aware of this fact but was doubly 
barred from making use of it, for in the first place 
he was not far enough advanced to gain much in 
formation in this way, and also in this particular 
instance it would have been unfair to attempt to 
learn why Louise had done as she had except by the 
method of calling on her in person. 

But there remained a slight possibility that Mar 
jorie knew something about the matter and might 
be willing to give him a few hints, and also he 
thought that she would sympathize with him and 

159 


160 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

thus encourage him even if she did not give him any 
real information. 

But Marjorie, though she had come at his call for 
help, had not come in the way he had expected. He 
knew that Marjorie could sense from the vibrations 
that surrounded him that he was in deep trouble, 
and he had expected that she would come up all 
sympathy and interest and ready to proffer her 
help, so it was no wonder that he should have been 
somewhat shocked to find her so full of life and happi 
ness and the sheer, pure joy of living. Sympathy 
was apparently far from her mind just at the time. 

4 'Oh, Jimjnie, I'm so glad you called me. I was 
wonderng whether you would come over soon. I 
have so much to tell you; just the most * be-you-tif uT 
things that you ever dreamed of!" 

Jimmie looked at her, contemplatively, but was 
silent. 

* * They Ve given me a promotion, Jimmie, isn 't that 
fine? Now I can do more work and be of some real 
use. They've given me a little class to teach, some 
of the little children who have just passed over, and 
they're such dear little things! They were so fright 
ened and bewildered, but I've been showing them 
that there's nothing to fear and nothing around 
them but love, and it's so beautiful to see them come 
out of their shells of terror and just blossom out as 


LIGHT AGAIN 161 

the little flowers do when the sun shines on them. 
I'm so happy I can't stay still." 

What an object lesson it would have been to some 
of the sorrowing of earth life could they have seen 
that radiant girl with the love and happiness of 
that plane on which she was living, and trans 
figured with the joy of the realm into which she 
was leading those poor little mites who had been 
driven out of their bodies by the harshness of con 
ditions on the physical plane. Could the relatives 
of those children have seen her, they would have 
given their sorrow and sympathy, not to the ones 
who had "died," but to those who had been left to 
face the long struggle and hard experiences of 
earth. 

Jimmie tried to meet her mood and succeeded in 
congratulating her on the congenial work which had 
been assigned to her, but the dominant thought in 
his mind would not be banished so easily and he 
blurted out: 

"I'm in trouble, Marjorie." 

Instantly Marjorie's face grew grave and Jimmie 
continued : 

"Have you seen Louise lately?" 

"No, Jimmie, I have not. I've been so very busy, 
and then you know I don't go down to the earth 

11 


162 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

plane. The only time I see any of my earth friends 
is when they come over here in sleep, and they often 
fail to come. I'm sure there's nothing serious troub 
ling you. You know that you and Louise are both 
on the earth plane, and you can go and see her if 
you want to. It's fortunate you asked me the ques 
tion because I will just forget it; but suppose you 
had asked the Elder Brother a question of mere 
curiosity, what would he have thought!" 

Her face had cleared and she was now laughing 
at him again, but she had given him quite a shock. 

"Marjorie, I envy those little children. Sometime 
I want to come over and see your little class if I may. 
Now I am going back and I will take your advice, for 
you have helped me more than you know, perhaps, 
and more than I expected. You are a dear, true 
friend, Marjorie." 

Back in his physical body Jimmie thought over 
her words and realized more and more how he had 
let his selfishness mislead him. "Curiosity!" A 
"question of mere curiosity," it certainly was. The 
very thing he had known well he must not do, he had 
done. And she had not rebuked him nor found 
fault with him, but had just led him so gently and 
so kindly to see his error. He made up his mind 
that never again would he make such a mistake and 


LIGHT AGAIN 163 

never again would he forget the great watchword of 
"Service." 


"Mother! I can see it! 0 Mother, Mother! I can 
see it!" 

"Can you! Oh, darling, are you sure? Don't strain 
your eyes. Remember what the doctor said. Better 
let me put the bandage back." 

"No, no. I can't bear that awful bandage any 
more. I can see, I tell you. I saw that lone pine 
over on the ridge almost as well as I ever saw it. 
Don't put the bandage back. I'll keep my eyes shut 
and that will do as well. I promise I will. Really 
and truly I will. And I'm going out for a little 
walk all by myself. I promise you I won't look much 
and I'll keep my eyes almost closed." 

"You willful girl! Don't go and spoil everything 
now. Better let me put the bandage back and lie 
down for a while." 

"Remember I'm a nurse, Mother, and I know a 
lot. I won't strain my eyes even the least little bit, 
but I must get out for a little walk or I think I'll 
die. Please, Mother! I know the way blindfolded 
even, so I won't need to look but just a little." 

"Where do you want to go?" 

"Just over to the old pine on the ridge and then 
I'll come right back. I know the way in the dark, 
and I think if I just walk over there all by myself 


164 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

and touch the old tree, it will almost make me well 
again. ' ' 

"Well, all right, but don't be gone long or I'll 
come after you, and don't try to open your eyes. 
They're too weak yet." 

The sun was shining almost directly down upon a 
little cotttage where this conversation took place, 
filling the gently rolling country side with its sum 
mer glory, flecking the ground between the trees 
with quivering splotches of gold, and bringing into 
sharp relief the houses of the village beyond and the 
ridges of the woods nearby, and showing in its lonely 
grandeur the great tree which reared its head far 
above its fellows on a low elevation some few hun 
dred yards behind the house. 

It was towards this tree that a girl soon took her 
way, emerging from the back door of the house, and 
wearing on her head an old-fashioned sun bonnet 
which effectually shaded her face from the brilliant 
light around her. She walked slowly as though a 
little uncertain of the path and with one hand partly 
outstretched in the manner of one who walks by 
night. 

There was a distinct path towards the big tree, for 
it was the short cut to the village and always used 
by those who preferred to walk through the cool of 
the woods instead of by the slightly longer wagon 
road. 


LIGHT AGAIN 165 

The girl walked along it as though it were familiar 
to her, as indeed it should be, for she had been born 
and brought up in that little cottage where her 
mother had just gone back to the homely task of 
washing dishes after sundry long and anxious looks 
at the retreating figure. 

There was no danger to the venturesome traveler, 
she knew, for there in the great State of New York 
there were no invading armies and no murderous ar 
tillery or bombs. No danger threatened that slender 
figure on the path, either from man or beast, and yet 
the mother sought the doorway every now and then 
to cast another loving look at the sunbonnet bobbing 
its leisurely way towards the goal of the great tree 
on the ridge. No, there was no danger, for war was 
far from this peaceful land. 

Now the sunbonnet was near the tree and soon it 
would be starting on its return journey. But stop! 
The mother took off her glasses and polished them 
on her apron. Some one else was on the path. Some 
one else wearing a uniform and looking like a sol 
dier. Surely it could not be. Soldiers sometimes 
passed through the village but not often, and the 
village boys who could go had all gone to the war. 
Strangers never came along this path. Well! The 
soldier man had stopped the sunbonnet and was 
talking to it, asking the way, doubtless. How long 
it took to ask the way ! Sunbonnet, Sunbonnet ! what 


166 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

is the matter? Don't you know better than to stop 
and talk to strange soldier men? The soldier man 
has caught Sunbonnet in his arms and is embracing 
her! Oh, this is awful! The mother hastened out of 
the back door and along the path. Her suspense did 
not last long for she soon met Sunbonnet walking 
back, and with her, his arm about her, walked a 
tall officer who was calling her " Louise" and other 
things, just as though Sunbonnet had known him 
well. 

That afternoon as they all sat on the porch, every 
thing was made clear. Jimmie had started to ride 
to the house after being directed as to the way, but 
something had changed his mind and he had walked. 

"And do you know, I was about to take the long 
way by the road when a little friend of mine whom 
I know as ' * Buster ' ' called to me from the woods and 
showed me the path." 

"Buster, Buster," said Louise thoughtfully, "I 
don't remember any boy around here who is called 
that." 

"No. That's another story which I'll tell you 
some day, but Buster thought he owed me a good 
turn and right well he paid his debt." 

Louise too had her story to tell. There had been 
a great need, and she had been sent to a station up 
near the front where a temporary hospital was locat- 


LtiGHT AGAIN 167 

ed and where the nurses and surgeons were working 
to the limit of endurance. One night an airman of 
the great nation whose high degree of culture impels 
it to bomb hospitals and other defenseless places, had 
dropped a number of bombs on the spot, and one of 
them had fallen near Louise as she was trying to 
help her wounded charge away from the sign of the 
Red Cross which ought to have been their best pro 
tection. A great flash and roar, a violent blow on 
the head, and she had known nothing more until she 
awakened in a hospital in Paris to find her eyes 
tightly bandaged and their sight very nearly gone. 
Her first thought was for Jimmie, and she deter 
mined that never would she burden him with a sight 
less and disfigured wife — hence the letter which in 
the despair of her heart she had had written in 
defiance of the rules, and which another nurse had 
posted for her. 

The disfigurement had yielded to skillful treat 
ment, but the eyesight grew worse, and she was sent 
home, a woebegone little piece of flotsam cast by the 
great storm of war upon a peaceful shore. 

But in the last day or two she had been able to 
discern a little light, and that morning, having 
quietly removed the bandage, she had found that, 
though blurred and distorted, her sight was coming 
back. 


168 IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING DEAD 

"And Oh! God is good to me, Jimmie. He has 
given me back my sight, and He has given me some 
thing worth so much more even than that." 

"What?" 

"How much would you like to know?" 
***** 

Well, well! This is not a story of love but a story 
of the Land of the Living Dead. And yet how can 
they be separated ? For all love is of God whose name 
is Love, and to those who do His will there is naught 
in all the universe, either in this world or the next, 
but love. There are sacrifice and service, but they 
are just the evidences of love, showing itself in action. 
In the Land of the Living Dead there is Love too, 
and no account of that Land can be true which does 
not tell of the love which throbs and pulsates through 
all its beautiful worlds. Even down in those dark 
realms of which I have not spoken there is a dim 
light which filters through, and the very pain which 
is felt there is but the preparation for the love which 
one day will fill all the universe, when the knowl 
edge of God shall cover the earth as the waters cover 
the sea.

This remarkable book by Max Heindel marks an entirely 
new departure in mystic literature. 

For the first time in the history of the Western Wisdom 
Teaching concerning Life and Being which the Rosicrucians 
have guarded for centuries, is here given by an authorized 
messenger, for it is held that the world is ready to receive 
this advanced science of the soul, the religious philosophy of 
the Aquarian Age, now at hand. The existing scul-hunger 
and the satisfying nature of the Rosicrucian teachings are 
equally well attested by the phenomenal sale of this great 
book, and many thousands of letters received by the author 
from grateful students located all over the world, who testify 
that they there found what they have long sought elsewhere 
in vain. 

We give herewith some headings of chapters and sub 
divisions as a slight indication of what is contained in this 
mine of mystic light and knowledge. 

Part I. 

The Visible and Invisible Worlds, The Four Kingdoms, Man 
and the Method of Evolution. Spirit, Soul and Body; 
Thought, Memory and Soul-growth. The conscious, subcon 
scious and superconscious mind. The science of death, the 
beneficence of purgatory, life in heaven. Re-birth and the 
Law of Consequence. 

Part II.

Work of Evolution. Genesis and Evolution of Our Solar 
System. Chaos the seed-ground of Cosmos, Birth of the 
Planets, Planetary Spirits. Evolution of the Earth. The 
Moon, the eighth sphere of retrogression. Occult Analysis
