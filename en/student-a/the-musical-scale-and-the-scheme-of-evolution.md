contains much valuable information relative to ho
our solar system and all there is within was create
by the great solar Being we recognize by the sacre
name of God. Hitherto unknown information

come into existence including our own, their pa
and future evolution, their ultimate destiny, ar
the part that music has played from the beginnir
in the development of the great cosmic scheme, ar
which it will continue to play, until the final to
is sounded and perfection realized.

```
The whole solar system is one vast musical
instrument, spoken of in Greek Mythology a
"the seven-stringed lyre of Apollo." The signs of
the zodiac may be said to be the sounding board
of the Cosmic harp and the seven planets are
the strings; they emit different sounds as they
pass through the various signs, and therefor
they influence mankind in diverse manner
Should the harmony fail for one single moment
should there be the slightest discord in the
heavenly band, the whole universe as such must
crumble - Max Heindel.

THE method used by the creative Hierarchies
assisting man to develop his potential powers
was planned according to the vehicles needed
him to contact the various regions where the work
connected with his development was to be found
The vehicles needed were a physical body, a vital
body, a desire body, and a mind; and the method
used by the Great Ones to build these vehicles was
and is correlated to the different evolutionary Period
of the Earth, each of which was and is permeated by a
particular keynote.

Architecture, which has to do with the building
of forms, was the first lesson given to mankind. Man
commenced this task in the Saturn Period when he
started to assemble the material necessary with which
to build a physical body. His consciousness being in
the deepest trance state, he worked automatically
under the direction of the Lords of Flame, the Leo
life wave, whose keynote is Bb major. Architecture
is therefore correlated to the Saturn Period of the
earth's existence and the physical body which started
to develop at the beginning of that period became
impregnated with that particular tone. All archi-
tectural construction from the tiniest cell to God, is
based on Cosmic law and is worked out according
to certain prescribed patterns; and any deviation
from the plan is the cause of malformations and
incongruities. Such deviations have the same effect
as striking a false note in a musical chord.

Sculpture, which determines the contour of forms
was the second developmental task given to man-
kind. This work had its beginning in the Sun Period
of the world's existence when the formation of the
vital body became necessary to give shape to the
physical form. Man's consciousness at that time was a
deep sleep state, and he therefore did his work auto-
matically under the direction of the following life
waves: the Lords of Flame (Leo), the Lords of Wisdom
(Virgo), and the Cherubim (Cancer). Sculpture is cor-
related to the Sun Period, and the vital body; and this
vehicle always determines the direction in which a
given force is used, and therefore it endeavors to give
the correct shape to all forms. The keynote of Leo is
Bb major, that of Virgo is C natural, and Cancer's
keynote is Ab major.

Painting was the third art man began to develop.
It owes its impetus to an attempt to reproduce the
pictures seen in the Moon Period of the earth's
existence which man faintly remembered through the
medium of his dream picture consciousness. The work
of the Moon Period was done automatically under the
direction of the following life waves: the Lords of
Wisdom (Virgo), the Lords of Individuality (Libra),
and the Seraphim (Gemini), Virgo's keynote is C
natural, Libra's is D major, and Gemini's is F#
major. Painting is correlated to the Moon Period and
the desire body, both of which began their development
during that time.

Pythagoras, an occult teacher, asserted that the
world was called forth from chaos by sound or har-
mony, and constructed according to the principles
of musical proportion; that the seven planets which
rule the destiny of mortals have a harmonious motion
and intervals corresponding to the intervals of music
rendering various sounds so perfectly harmonized
that they produce the sweetest melody, which is in-
audible to man only by reason of the greatness of
the sound. which his ears are incapable of receiving.
Pythagoras made the distance from the Earth to the
Moon a whole tone; from the Moon to Mercury a
half tone; from Mercury to Venus a half tone; from
Venus to the Sun a whole tone and a half tone; from
the Sun to Mars a whole tone; from Mars to Jupiter
a half tone; from Jupiter to Saturn a half tone;
from Saturn to the zodiac a whole tone and a half tone;
tone. This forms an interval of seven tones, the bas
of the universal harmony.

Max Heindel says that Pythagoras was not ro-
mancing when he spoke of the music of the spheres,
for each one of the heavenly orbs has its definite
tone, and together they sound a celestial symphony.
He corroborates what Pythagoras stated by saying
that each star has its own keynote, and travels about
the Sun in such varying rates of speed that their
position cannot be duplicated but once in approxi-
mately twenty-six thousand years. The harmony
of the heavens changes at every moment of life. As
it changes so do the people of the world alter their
ideas and ideals. The circle movement of the planets
around the Sun, to the tune of the celestial symphony
created by themselves, marks man's progress along
the path of evolution.

Echoes of that heavenly music reach us here in
the Physical World. They are our most precious pos-
session even though they are as elusive as a will-o'-
the-wisp and cannot be permanently created. In the
First Heaven these echoes are, of course, much more
beautiful and have more permanency; and in the
World of Thought, where the Second and Third
Heavens are located, is found the sphere of tone.

In our earth life we are so immersed in the little
noises and sounds of our limited environment that
we are incapable of hearing the music produced by
the marching orbs. The real musician, however,
whether consciously or unconsciously, does tune in,
so to speak, on the Region of Concrete Thought where
he may hear a whole sonata or symphony as a single
glowing chord which he later translates into a musi-
cal composition of superb harmony, grace, and super-
nal beauty. Man has been likened to a monochord-
a musical instrument with a single string which
stretches from earth to the farthermost confines
of the zodiac.

Man's will owes its origin to God's will; and the
musician, by means of his own will power, hears this
power of the will of God permeating the solar system
expressed in sounds and tones. And through his own
creative ability, born of will and imagination, he
is able to reproduce in sound and tones both the will
power tones of God, which created the solar system,
and His imaginative idea tones, by means of which
He materialized it (the solar system).

Architecture, sculpture, and painting were a
impressed on man by great spiritual Beings, and these
arts then became part of his nature. But it is through
the power of man's own will that the musician has
become able to perceive the tones expressed by the
will of God, and to a certain extent reproduce them
himself. This is the origin of our physical world
music, which is man's own creation.

Music produces tone expressions of both God's
and man's highest power--the will, and therefore
we can readily see what a terrible causation man is
building for himself in desecrating it, by introducing
all kinds of discords, screechings, piercing noise,
moanings, and nerve racking inharmonies into it.
A knowing philosopher well expressed a great Cosmic
truth when he said, "Let me write the music for
a nation, and I care not who makes its laws." The
term musician herein used does not apply to the
ordinary singer or musical performer, but to the
master creators of music such as Beethoven, Mozart,
Wagner, Liszt, Chopin, and others in the same class.

Architecture may well be likened to frozen music,
seulpture to imprisoned music, painting to music
struggling for release, and music to the free, floating
manifestation of sound.

### <h3 id="chapter-2">CHAPTER II: MAN'S MONOCHORD</h3>

THE single string of the monochord finds its
counterpart in man's spinal cord, the lower
part of which is connected with the organs of re-
production, and the upper part with the brain, which
physical organ is related to thought. Working par-
ticularly with this cord are the Lucifer Spirits,
who govern that part of the cord which controls
the motor (action) nerves that expend the dynamic
energy stored in the body by the blood. The section
of the cord which governs the function that has
to do particularly with the upkeep and welfare of
the body is under control of the Angels, The part
of the cord that marks and registers the sensations
carried by the nerves is controlled by the Mercurians.
The spinal spirit gas which fills the central canal
of the spinal cord is the field of action of the great
spiritual hierarchy from Neptune.

The Lucifer Spirits do their work through the
power of the keynote sounded by Mars. The Angels
do their work through the power of the keynote
sounded by the Moon. The Neptunians do their work
through the power of the keynote sounded by Nep-
tune. The vibrations produced by these four key-
notes are continually impinging on the spinal cord,
and the spinal spirit essence in the central canal
of the cord.

In the masses of humanity the spinal spirít fire
is asleep, so to speak, and will remain so until the
Spirit is able to get better control of two of its
vehicles, the desire body and the mind; for this fiery
essence is a life force which either builds or destroys
depending on the way that it is used.

According to the foregoing it is plain to be seen
that the planets which most closely affect the spinal
cord, man's monochord, in a material way are Mars,
Moon, and Mercury; and that in the most advanced
of the Aryan race the vibration of Neptune is just
beginning to be felt.

Music is composed of three primary elements,
namely, melody, harmony, and rhythm. Melody is
composed of a succession of harmonious sounds sensed
by the auditory nerves which are connected with the
brain a physical organ that contacts the mind. It
is therefore through the mental body that the Spirit
is able to sense the melody produced on the physical
plane. An idiot or insane persen does not respond
to melody. Harmony consists of an agreeable blending
of tones, and is related to the feelings or emotions.
Feelings or emotions are expressions of the desire
body and therefore harmony may have an effect on
both man and animals, as both have desire bodies.
Rhythm is measured and balanced movement and is
expressed by the life force which actuates gestures
and other physical motion. The vital body absorbs
a superabundance of vital force (solar energy) which
it passes on to the physical body to keep it alive and
functioning. Hence rhythm is correlated to the vital
body. Plants have a vital body and are therefore
sensitive to rhythm.

Man has within his brain seven cavities which
during life are ordinarily considered empty. In
reality, however, these cavities are filled with a spirit
essence, each cavity having its own tone and color.
The tones produced by these cavities are correlated
to those of the Seven Spirits before the Throne -
Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, and
Mercury. The cavities or ventricles beginning with
the front of the brain, are (1) olfactory ventricle,
(2) lateral ventricle, (3) third ventricle, (4) fourth
ventricle, (5) pituitary body, (6) Pineal gland.
The seventh cavity is the skull and it combines all
of the elements into one grand whole.

The solar system is one vast musical instrument.
As there are twelve semitones in the chromatic scale,
so in the heavens we have the
twelve signs of the zodiac, and as
we have the seven white keys or
tones on the keyboard of the piano, 
so we have the seven planets. The
signs of the zodiac may he said to
be the sounding board of the cos-
mic harp and the seven planets
are the strings; and therefore they influence mankind
in diverse ways.

PICTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In the Bible we note how the seven-stringed harp
of David represents astrologically the keynotes of
the sevenfold planetary chain. The keynote of each
planet is composed of the quintessence of its aggre-
gate sounds. An amalgamation of the sorrows and
joys of our earth, the sounds of its winds and seas;
the rhythm of all its living forces combined, form
its tone or keynote. In like marner and on an ever
ascending scale, sound the notes of the entire plane-
tary chain, their union constituting the sublime
Music of the Spheres... "There's not the smallest
erb which thou beholdest, but in its motion like an
angel sings." So wrote the great poet-initiate, Shakes-
peare. This celestial music is the product of that
Word of which St. John wrote when he said: "In
the beginning was the Word, and the word was with
God, and the Word was God . . . . and without him
was not anything made that was made." (John I: 1-3)

### <h3 id="chapter-3">CHAPTER III: THE POWER OF MUSIC</h3>

```
Music is thus, in her health, the teacher of
perfect order, and is the voice of the obedience
of angels, and the companion of the course of
the spheres of heaven; and in her depravity she
is also the teacher of perfect disorder and dis-
obedience - Ruskin.
```

IN music between melody and rhythm we find
harmony, which may either rise and blend with
the vibration of pure thought, melody, or descend
it may mingle with the purely activity movement - 
impulse. If the pure melodio element, which carries
the will vibration of God and the Spirit in music
is omitted from a composition then the guiding power
is not there to control the activities of the desire and
physical bodies, and then the desires which revel in
excitement take charge, and being without the guiding
power of reason, disaster is likely to be the result.
It is the probability of harmony blending with im-
pulse that explains the reason why it is possible
for modern, so-called music which tends to bring
confusion instead of unifying coherence, to come
into existence.

Even before World War I, the psychic conditions
were so evil that man's emotions were unconsciously
stirred to such a high pitch that they were com-
pelled to find an outlet in some intensified form of
action. As the Lucifer Spirits revel in, and grow
through the intensity of feeling, that was their
opportunity to step in and insinuate into the human
consciousness a heightened form of rhythmic activity;
and as a result ragtime made its appearance. War
came on. The emotions soared still higher and be-
wildering conditions introduced the blues-moaning,
wailing, groaning, but feverishly surging on and on.
The downward tendency was now in full swing and
jazz made its appearance in so-called music - reck-
lessly fantastic and deliriously grotesque, Swing, a
step lower, followed jazz; then jitterbug, in all its
dizzy, maniacal, mass hysteria swept the country.
Since then blatant, more or less demoniacal noises
have gradually taken the place of celestial music, and
the frayed, overstimulated nerves of the victims of
these excruciating noises, fast becoming shattered,
have caused a variety of hopeless forms of dementia.
Now unless some force is set into action that will
literally shock the masses into a quieter, more thought-
ful frame of mind, even worse conditions will prevail.
If this cannot be done, or is considered inadvisable
by the great Ones who are directing man's evolution,
then some form of escape will have to be provided
for the worthy ones, and the rest will simply be
wiped out by a tremendous cosmic conflagration of
some sort; and at a later date-possibly another day
of manifestation-these unfortunate ones will be
given an opportunity to retrieve their losses.

Facing such tremendously appalling facts, in what
direction does it behoove man to look for the quickest
obtainable remedy? Is it possible, by searching either
in the past er in the future, that one may find a
clue which, when applied, will save the situation?

History is forever repeating itself. Lemuria was
destroyed by voleanie cataclysms when the masses
of its people ceased to progress. Atlantis was de-
stroyed by water when its people became so immersed
in evil that they were no longer amenable to the
instructions given to them by their wise leaders
Aryana rose from out of the great depth, and man-
kind was given another opportunity to proceed with
their evolution. Now, again man finds himself slipping
perilously near the end of a downward grade. Py-
thagoras, one of the greatest of seers, told his stu-
dents that the lyre was the secret symbol of human
construction--that the body of it represented the
physical form, the strings the nerves, and the musi-
cian who played it, the Spirit of man. "Playing on
its nerves," he said, "the Spirit has created a har-
monious, normal functioning, which, however, may
at any time be easily changed into discord if the
nature of man becomes defiled." Note the concealed
warning.

Again, Plato, a great Greek philosopher, and stu-
dent of the Mysteries, deprecates the idea that music
was intended solely to create cheerful and agreeable
emotions, but maintained rather that it should in-
culcate a love of all that is noble, and an aversion
for all that is mean, degrading, and low, and nothing
could more strongly influence man's innermost being
than melody and rhythm. He was so firmly con-
vinced of this fact that he averred the introduction
of a new and presumably enervating musical scale
would endanger the future of a whole nation; that it
was not possible to alter a key without shaking the
very foundation of the state. Plato further affirmed
that music which ennobles the mind (melody) is of
a higher kind than that which merely appeals to the
senses. He strongly insisted that it was the paramount
duty of the Legislature to suppress all music of a
lascivious character, and to encourage only that
which was pure and dignified. The greatest care was
to be taken in the selection of all instrumental music,
because the absence of words rendered its significance
more or less doubtful, making it difficult to foresee
whether it would exercise on the people a benign or
a baneful influence; popular taste, always being tick-
led by sensuous and meretricious (gaudy) effects, was
to be treated with deserved contempt. Here we have
the answer to the sensible way of changing undesir-
able conditions:: Replace evil practices all of which
produce more or less calamitous results with positive,
high vibrating activities which induce the greatest
amount of good to the greatest number of people.

In discarding the ragtime, jazz, swing, bebop,
et cetera noises, nothing of real music would be lost.
In their appeal to the sensual, sentimental desires
through an excessive variety of so-called harmonic
combinations, of discordant successions of intervals
between notes arising out of the complexities of
modern key-relationships, and the distracting chords
resulting, no new elements have really been intro-
duced, but merely a confusion and an overelaborated
tion of the old ones. In the equally overemphasized
rhythmic musical element found in certain kinds of
pop:alar so-called musie, the real musical experience
cannot descend through harmony into artistic move-
ment activity but is, as it were, forced down into
parely physical gyrations inelegant in the extreme.

The three primary divisions of music - melody
harmony, and rhythm are correlated to the three
primary powers of God, namely: will, love-wisdom
and activity. Will, which includes intellect and rea-
son, united with love-wisdom produces a mode of
activity correlated to the poised, balanced, celestial
rhythm (activity) of God which marshaled the atoms
of our solar system into the matrix of the various
forms prepared for them by the energy-love powers
of the Creator. Divorce will (melody) from love
(harmony) and unite love with activity (rhythm),
and the two, being bereft of the guiding power of
will (intellect and reason), may produce any sort
of monstrosity which the evil forces may desire to
bring into being. Unchecked, their malevolent activi-
ties will in time certainly wreck a nation. No attempt
to revolutionize the art of music can produce desired
results unless it begins with the artistic principle
of coherence and a correct balancing of the three
elements of which music is composed, namely: melody,
harmony, and rhythm.

### <h3 id="chapter-4">CHAPTER IV: THE CORRELATION OF MUSIC TO THE SOLAR GOD</h3>

| Music	     | God        | Powers      | Expression      |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| 1. Melody	 | 1. Father  | 1. Will     | 1. Intelligence |
| 2. Harmony | 2. Christ  | 2. Love	    | 2. Feeling      |
| 3. Rhythm  | 3. Jehovah | 3. Activity	| 3. Motion       |

MELODY, the highest power of music, includes
reason, intellect, and judgment. When harmony
and rhythm anite and become divorced from melody,
we have a succession of tones undirected by in-
telligence that arouse the feelings (harmony) which
express themselves in a series of gyrating, fantastic,
sensual movements (motion). This may lead to the
lowest form of emotional (activity) excesses, some of
which jazz bandleader Benny Goodman describes as
the chandelier-kicking type, the noisy pop-bottle-
throwing hoodlum type, the yeil and stomp type, the
St. Vitus itch type, the feet tapping out of time, and
arms jerking to the rhythm type, the spinning like
a windmill in a hurricane type, and the mass hysteria,
nightmare type—and all as a reaction to the kind of
so-called music played in some of our schools, in most
of our public places, and universally in dance halls.
Right here is the enervating (lessening of mental
or moral vigor) form of music mentioned by Plato
as a danger to the future of the whole nation. Mr.
Goodman mentions particularly how when Ziggy
Elman blew "a long spine-tingling hot note" on
his trumpet "right through a person" the dancers
lost their self-control, and when Gene Krupa rolled
off a series of machine-gun notes on his drum they
shook, their eyes popped out, heads pecked, and arms
jerked.

Even from a physical viewpoint, there is a great
danger in blowing a loud prolonged note on an in-
strument. Each person has his or her own keynote
located in the lower part of the back of the head,
at the base of the brain. If this note is struck slowly
and soothingly it will build and rest the body, tone
the nerves, and restore health, If, on the other hand,
it is sounded in a dominant way, loud and long
enough, it wili kill as surely as will a bullet fired
front a gun. In a mass assembly one has no way of
knowing individual keynotes; hence in a crowd there
is always danger in sounding a load, dominant, pro-
longed note on any instrument; and the continual
dinning of jazz blasts on the eardrums of children
is likely to develop a race of neurotics.

Let us note that jazz so-called music is a desecra-
tion of the Christ force (harmony) and the Jehovistic
creative energy (rhythm). The first desecration of
the Jehovistic force oecurred during the Lemurian
Epoch and is designated as the "fall of man." This
digression from the path of orderly evolution laid
out by Jehovah was caused by the Lucifer Spirits
who (note) revel and evolve by intensity of feeling.
The nature of an emotion is not so essential to them
as the intensity, so far as their purpose is concerned.
Therefore they stir the human passions of the lower
nature, which are more intense in our present stage
of evolution than are feelings of joy and love. Con-
sequently these beings do not hesitate to desecrate
both the love (Christ) and life (Jehovah) forces of
God to accomplish their purpose. This they have
been adrcit enough to do through introducing cleverly
concealed discords into our music, and emphasizing
them with loud-sounding, blatant instruments such
as the horn, trumpet, trombone, saxophone, drum,
cymbals, and others. Once they get an entering wedge,
we see their nefarious influence manifesting every-
where. In our literature we find it showing up in the
form of sex and all kinds of ecriminal exciting stories:
in painting we discover it in distorted, grotesque
figures of all kinds; in statuary, unnecessarily nude,
we see it depicting all sorts of incongraities. Beauty,
artistry, the esthetic, everywhere dragged down to the
tawdry, the coarse-many times approaching real
grossness, even to the lowest form of indecency.

As man's spiritual sight becomes clearer and his
individual will stronger, he is gradually going to
free himself from the influence of the Lucifer Spirits,
and align himself with the Christ force, which is love.
Then will (melody), and love (harmony), will de-
velop activity (rhythm), a new power (epigenesis),
the force of which will further man's spiritual prog-
ress at a rate of rapidity the like of which has
hitherto been unknown.

The Lucifer Spirits realize that mankind, through
the combined power of will and love, will be able in
time to free themselves from their influence and par-
tial control. They know, too, that man's body is
built and sustained by the power of music. Now, if
they can pervert this music to the extent that it
will derange his physical body through the nervous
system so that it will no longer be capable of supply-
ing the needed amount of conscious soul essence with
which to develop his will power, they can continue
to hold him in partial bondage and use nim for their
own benefit; and this is exactly what they nave done.
It is not that these beings have any desire to injure
mankind, but that they need man's bodies to work
through, and have no intention of releasing them,
so long as their need continues and they have the
power to hold them. Those who accept this new, so-
called music and allow it to get inside of them, so
to speak, are the ones who will have their spiritual
development retarded. Those who refuse to accept it
and keep it out of their consciousness as much as
possible, will find their spiritual progress little, if
any, hindered by it. Those who are responsible for
the production of this so-called music, and those
whose nerves have become hopelessly jangled by it,
may be permitted to go to war as soldiers and nurses
in order to remove them from the present earth con-
ditions and give them a future opportunity to start
all over, later, in a better environment.

The Lucifer Spirits, through positive disobedience
to the cosmic plan, lost out to a great extent in their
scheme of evolution, and now they are taking advan-
tage of every possible means to retrieve their lost
estate. All of this information has been made known
to humanity through the Western Wisdom teachings;
and a release from the Lucifers' domination is offered
to all through the development of the Christ love
power and its union with the will of the Father.
both of which are found in replica in all mankind.
Let us note that the Cosmo-Conception, the textbook
given to humanity by the Elder Brothers of the Rose
Cross, who, directed by the Archangel Christ, have
charge of the evolution of humanity at the present
time, has been miraculously scattered throughout the
world, and its price has been kept so low that it
is available to all who are ready to receive the truths
revealed therein.

The melodic will of the Father uniting with the
harmonic love of the Christ has the power to produce
an active rhythmic vibration, the force of which can-
not possibly be arrested nor its destined objective
deflected, for it is that same manifested energy of
the God of our solar system which brought all that
IS into being, and has the power to resolve it all
into Chaos at any time He so desires. It is therefore
absolutely impossible for any of God's creations
from the most advanced of His life waves to those
youngest in evolution, ultimately to frustrate the
maturity of His plans, for they are as sternal and
unwavering in their processes as is God Himself.

It is, however, possible for the members of a particu-
lar life wave, or even individuals of it, to rebel and for
the time being frustrate their own evolutionary prog
ress despite all of the assistance that is being given
to them by those wiser and more advanced than
themselves. In such instances those in charge of evo-
lation at times permit these beings to go on and
destroy their physical selves through their own wilful
disobedience brought about by their own ignorance
of the beneficent results obtained through divine
administration, all in order that they may return to
earth at a later date, under a better influence and
an improved environment, relieved of all hate and
desire to destroy their fellow men, the change being
brought about by the beneficent, cleansing agencies
active in the purgatorial region.

When a life wave, a nation, a community, or even
an individual strives to the uttermost to follow the
example of the Christ by manifesting His precepts
in their daily lives, such a one or ones may rest
assured that only those things most needed to further
their own development, whether apparently good or
evil, will come to them. If the lessons they contain
are rightly learned and practiced, they will all result
in inestimable good, not only to themselves, but to
a great extent they will have a beneficent effect on
all others whom they may contact in their daily lives.

Conditions in the world today are all leading up
to changes so great that their magnitude can scarcely
be conceived by our present limited consciousness.
Two more subraces are to be evolved, and each will
run its own short course; preparations have already
begun for the development of the sixth great root
race, the expansion of whose consciousness, whose
physical and mental development, and whose astonish-
ing spiritual attainments will place them in the fore-
most rank of earth's supermen. Then, too, a great
continent will surely emerge from the bed of the
Pacific Ocean, the vastness, the tropical beauty, and
the material abundance of which cannot be conceived
or even faintly imagined by mortal man as he exists
today.

As an approximately definite ratio between land
and water areas must be maintained in order that
the earth preserve its gravitational equilibrium, it
will be necessary that a certain amount of land
go dewn into the ocean to balance that which has
emerged from it. This land will take with it as many
of its inhabitants as have become so enmeshed in mate-
riality that such a method will have to be applied
in order to break up their crystallized condition and
fit them for further growth. But nothing is ever lost
in the kingdom of God. Stragglers, even failures, may
come into being; but so beneficent is the Creator that
in the fulness of time He gathers together even those
unfortunate ones and starts them all over again in
a different environment under the direction and
guidance of great Beings whose infinite patience has
fitted them to undertake the Herculean task of re-
deeming and rebuilding that which appeared to be
lost.

Before going farther it might be well to explain
something of the process of creation in relation to
our solar system as revealed by the Order of the Rose
Cross which is as follows: The God of our solar
system has created seven distinct regions in which
He is carrying on the evolution of all things created
by Him. The names of these regions beginning with
the first developed are, the World of God Region,
the World of Virgin Spirits Region, the World of
Divine Spirit Region, the World of Life Spirit Re-
gion, the World of Thought Region, the Desire World
Region, and the Physical World Region. The World
of Thought Region is divided into two parts, Abstract
Thought and Concrete Thought. The Physical World
Region also has two divisions, Etheric and Chemical.

The God of our solar system creates in life waves
consisting of an untold number of Virgin Spirits
and classified by Him according to the time created.
The name of the first life wave created by Him is
Aries, the second Taurus, the third Gemini, the fourth
Cancer, the fifth Leo, the sixth Virgo, the seventh
Libra, the eighth Scorpio, the ninth Sagittarius, the
tenth Capricorn, the eleventh Aquarius, and the
twelfth Pisces. These same names are used in the
zodiac also, but there they refer to an entirely differ-
ent scheme of creation. The life waves of beings men-
tioned are scattered throughout the various seven
regions. The twelfth life wave, the Piscean, is com-
posed of our present humanity, and when inhabiting
physical bodies are to be found in the Physical World
Region.

The time required to carry on the work of certain
phases of evolution is divided into periods, namely:
The Saturn Period, followed by the Sun Period, then
the Moon Period, next the Earth Period, then the
Jupiter Period, next the Venus Period, and last the
Vulcan Period, which is followed by a cosmic night
of rest.

### <h3 id="chapter-5">CHAPTER V: OUR MUSICAL ARCHETYPES</h3>

NOTHING has existed since the dawn of creation
until an archetype was first built. In forming
a solar system the first power of God, the will, wills
to create, and it arouses the second power, wisdom-
love. This second force, through the power of imagina-
tion, conceives the idea (archetype) of a solar system;
then the third power, activity, working in Cosmic
substance produces motion, and the melodie, har-
monious, rhythmic power builds a separate archetype
for all that takes form, from clod to God.

In the fourth region of Concrete Thought are
found the archetypes of all forms manifesting here
in the physical world. There, however, all solid earth
objects appear as vacuous (empty) cavities from
which a basic keynote is continually sounded. An
archetype is a singing, vibrating hollow cavity which
lives, moves, and creates as a mechanical appliance
made by man works without reason. In appearance
it is something like a plaster mold here in this world.
As plaster is poured into the plaster mold and there
forms a statue, so the physical atoms are marshaled
into a like pattern and form a living body, be it plant.
animal, or man. Each archetype emits a harmonious.
musical tone and it is this sound that attracts and
molds the physical atoms into shape.

In every human being in the region of the medulla
oblongata, at the head of the spinal cord, is a flame
which pulsates and vibrates in a most wonderful
manner. It is colored with different rays according
to the nature of each individual human being. 'This
fire emits a singing sound like the buzz of a bee, and
this sound is the keynote of the physical body sounded
also by the archetype. The tone of the archetype
changes through life, and as it changes so also the
dense body undergoes certain changes.

Every act of every human being has a direct effect
on the archetype of his body. If the act is in harmony
with the laws of life and evolution it strengthens the
archetype and makes for a longer life in which the
individual will get the maximum of experience and
make soul growth commensurate with his status in
life and his capacity for learning. Thus fewer em-
bodiments will be necessary to bring him to per-
fection than for one who shirks the strain of life and
endeavors to escape its burdens, or one who applies
his efforts destructively. In the latter type of life
the archetype is strained and breaks early.

According to the foregoing, those whose acts are
contrary to law shorten their lives and have to seek
new embodiments a greater number of times than
those who live in harmony with the law. This applies
to all without exception, but it has greater signifi-
cance in the lives of those who are consciously work-
ing with the laws of evolution than in those of others.
The kuowledge of these facts should add a hundred-
fold to our zest and zeal for doing good. Even if
we have started, as we say, "late in life," we may
easily lay up more "treasures" in the last few years
than we did in several previous lives. Above all, we
are getting in line for an early start in lives to come.

There are twelve distinct life waves which have
been working with mankind more or less since the
beginning of the Saturn Period. Their names are:
Aries (Xeophim), Taurus (Teraphim), Gemini (Sera-
phin, Cancer (Cherubim), Leo (Lords of Flame),
Virgo (Lords of Wisdom), Libra (Lords of Indi-
viduality), Scorpio (Lords of Form), Sagittarius
(Lords of Mind), Capricorn (Archangels), Aquarius
(Angels), Pisces (Virgin Spirits, or mankind). Each
of these separate life waves has a keynote: Aries
Db major, Taurus Eb major, Gemini F# major, Can-
cer Ab major, Leo Bb major, Virgo C natural major,
Libra D major, Scorpio E major, Sagittarius F major,
Capricorn G major, Aquarius A major, Pisces B
major. The keynote of a piece of music is the tonic
or fundamental tone on which the musical com-
position is built.

The entire period of man's involution and evolu-
tion is founded on the musical scale, which is of
heavenly origin. Max Heindel tells us that mankind
went through three elemental stages before the Saturn
Period, and these stages are represented at the lowest
end of the piano keyboard by A, A#, and B. The
Saturn Period begins with the sound represented
by low C on the piano keyboard and extends upward
to B, which tone is ineluded, making 12 notes, 7 of
which are white and 5 dark. Seven Brothers of the
Order of the Rose Cross go out into the world and
work among mankind. Five are not seen in the world.

Before humanity lost contact with the Spiritual
Region of Concrete Thought they knew that it was
a region of musical tones and that these tones per-
meated and built all the archetypes of all things
which exist in the lower worlds, including themselves,
and that therefore they had all of these tones
within themselves. They knew that they were living
musical instruments whose tones were heard by them-
selves through a sort of inner sense perception. The
superconsciousness of man knows all of this also the
tremendous power contained within these musical
tones. Having lost the power to control this inner
force or even to contact it truly wi' hin, man has sought
by means of musical ins'ruments to reproduce without,
the tones dimly sensed in his half-submerged memory.
In place of man, an inner-conscious musical instru-
ment, we now have musical instruments created by
man; and these instruments express some phase of
his inner nature.

The wind instruments are correlated to melody-
the will, the intellect, the head, thinking and the air
or tune they carry is easily memorized. The stringed
instruments are correlated to harmony-the emotions,
the imaginstion, the heart and arouse feslings of
happiness, joy, pleasure, pain, sorrow, longings and
regret. The percussion instruments are correlated
to rhythm-movement, the muscles, action of the
upper and lower limbs and stir in their listeners
a desire for action such as marching, dancing, clap-
ping hands, stamping feet in rhythmic time.

Man himself is really a threefold musical instru-
ment, but in his present state of consciousness he
has temporarily lost contact with the knowledge of
his inner powers. He will, however, sometime in the
future reestablish this contact by first sensing, then
with an inner sense actually hearing the keynote of
his own dense body sounded in the back and lower
part of his head. This tone will connect him with
the seven stringed lyre located in the cerebrum. Then
it is only a question of time for development, until
he will be able to create by the musical power of
the spoken word. Furthermore, he will be able to
contact the musical tones used in building his vital
and desire bodies, and through an objective waking
consciousness of their work he will become as con-
scious of these vehicles and how they function as
he now is of his dense physical body.

It is the Spirit that sees, hears, smells, tastes, and
feels, and not the sense organs themselves. In fact,
they are utterly useless for such purposes when the
Spirit is absent from the body. They are only instru-
ments by means of which the Spirit contacts the
physical world; but the Spirit itself is possessed of
all these faculties, and more, too, when it is fune-
tioning on the invisible planes either during the time
the body is asleep or when, as an Initiate, it leaves
the body consciously and functions in the higher
regions.

When the everyday waking consciousness con-
sciously contacts the senses of the Spirit man will
be prepared to begin the work belonging to Initiation
for his Spirit senses will, step by step, reveal to him
consciously all that has taken place since he began
his work of development in the Saturn Period, all of
which will be accomplished through the power of
the spoken word sound music. Then man will con-
sciously learn through seeing, how the great Star
Ange's, directed and aided by the God of the solar
system, created all that is therein. He will see how
through the power of musical sound the various life
waves were spoken into existence and have been
brought up to their present status in evolution. He
need not stop here, for by his own efforts he may go
on and learn of future development reserved for
future revolutions and periods.

The whole solar system is one vast musical in-
strument which is God. In the Saturn Period the
tones sounded by Him and His helpers are repre-
sented by the sounds produced by the lowest octave
of the musical scale. It was these tones, beginning
with the lowest, that successively built the seven
globes on which all life existed and began its slow
development. The white keys of all musical octaves
produce the building tones, positive; and the black
keys produce the assimilative tones, negative; both
tones are required in order to produce results (will,
love, activity-father, mother, child; as above, su
below).

The life waves that worked with us during the
Saturn Period were Aries, Taurus, and Leo. The
keynote of Aries is Db major. The keynote of Taurus
is Eb major, and the keynote of Leo is Bb major.
Note that the black keys in the piano are assimi-
lative, and it was during the first revolution of
this Saturn Period that the Leos, Lords of Flame,
succeeded in implanting in man's evolving structure
the germ of the physical body. At this time raan was
pure differentiated Spirit, located in the Region of
Divine Spirit, which is the region of pure will.

It is man's inner senses, taken collectively, that
in time will be able to manifest at any moment en
any plane without the aid of specialized organs cor-
related to that plane and make themselves known to
the waking objective consciousness. When this state
of development is reached man will see, hear, smell,
taste, and feel with his entire physical body. Later
he will be able te exercise the same senses in the
same way (control by will) in relation to his vital
body, then in relation to his desire body, and still
later in relation to his mental body. All this develop-
ment will manifest through the power of the spoken
word of God, the Creator of our solar system.

The first inner or spiritual sense to be contacted
by man's objective waking consciousness will be
hearing (sound); the next will be feeling, then taste,
then smell, and finally sight. The method used to
make this contact with the inner or spiritual senses
is concentration. Concentration is a one-pointed
manifestation brought about by the Spirit, through
the power of its will, whereby it (the Spirit) is able
absolutely to shut out all physical conditions from
the waking objective consciousness and make this
consciousnesss aware of its (the Spirit's) inner spir-
itual powers while the Spirit is still within its four-
fold interpenetrated vehicles the physical, vital,
desire, and mental bodies.

### <h3 id="chapter-6">CHAPTER VI: THE MUSICAL OCTAVES AND THE COSMIC SCHEME</h3>

THE piano is not the result of man's endeavor
to reproduce the tones of his own inner self
dimly remembered, but it is a product of man's
materialized perception of music, and accordingly
it is a purely earthborn instrument. Therefore it is
not only a convenient instrument, but a most valuable
one to those truly great musicians who are able
to contact real heaven world music, bring it down
to earth, and make a man-made, material-constructed
machine reproduce it.

While all mechanical instruments and the radio
are of great value, they can never take the place
of the piano to those who have once learned the
value of the chords as correlated to the develop-
ment of the Spirit and all its vehicles. The piano
keyboard spreads all of its 88 keys (52 white and 36
black) which produce 124 tones, right before the
performer. The white keys produce 52 (7) of the
124 (7) tones, and the black keys produce 72 (9)
tones. Nine is the number of humanity and seven (7)
is the number of man's three (3) spiritual powers,
plus his four (4) vehicles--mind, desire body, vital
body, and physical body.
There are five (5) lines on the musical staff and
four (4) spaces-again five and four equal nine, the
number of humanity. There are seven (7) letters in

always occupy the same position on the musical
staff. There are s en notes to the musical scale, do,
re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, which change position on the
staff. For instance, if the scale is C natural, the
first do is found on the added line below the staff.
If there is one sharp, the do is found on the second
line of the staff. If one flat, then do is found in the
first space on the staff, et cetera.

The 12 semitones of the octave inform with the
12 months of the year and the 12 life waves created
by the God of our solar system, also the 12 creative
Hierarchies composing the zodiac. The 7 tones,
represented by C, D, E, F, G, A, B, conform to the
7 Spirits before the Throne. The 5 dark keys in the
octave represent the five life waves, Aries, Taurus,
Gemini, Cancer, and Leo, that first worked with our
humanity. The 7 light keys represent the hierarchical
life waves, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capri-
corn, Aquarius, and Pisces, still working with human-
ity during the Earth Period.
As occult mysteries are revealed to us, we very
soon grasp the significant fact that throughout all
the complexities of the world there runs a true orderly
principle which never deviates in its manifestations
One of the first things that become apparent to
the real occult student is the fact that the cosmos is
built upon the 1-3-5-7-10 and 12 aspects, and that
the 12 semitones of the musical octave conform in
every detail to the cosmic scheme in fact, to a
bewildering degree when it is remembered that in
building the musical octave it was necessary to con-
tact the world of tone, the Second Heaven, located
in the World of Thought Region, which, while com-
paratively intangible to the physical senses still is
the very basis of material manifestation. We see
this same number scheme carried out both in the

36
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
individualized Spirit and in God, the Creator of
our solar system. For example: God is one (1). His
three (3) powers are will, wisdom-love, and activity.
His seven (7) planetary helpers called the Seven
Spirits before the Throne in the Bible. Man has three
(3) powers, designated as divine spirit, life spirit,
and human spirit, a link (1) of mind, and his three
(3) lower vehicles-desire, vital, and physical bodies
-from which he extracts a threefold (3) essence
called soul.
Before going farther it is well to review the follow-
ing facts: The chromatic scale includes all of the
tones in the octave, both white and black keys, taken
in regular order beginning with C. C is always
before the two black key cluster on the piano. There
are twelve tones in the chromatic scale.
The diatonic scale is composed of the tones pro-
duced by the white keys of the piano only-no black
keys. There are seven tones (keys) in the diatonic
scale.
Note these other likenesses to these scales:
There are twelve colors, seven visible and five in-
visible to physical sight.
There are twelve orifices in the body, seven visible
and five invisible.
There are twelve great life waves evolving in cur
scheme of evolution, five of which have completed
their work and withdrawn from manifestation: Aries,
Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo. The other seven are
active during the Earth Period: Virgo, Libra, Scorpio,
Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces,
The general rule for a chord in music is, two notes
in the base clef (positive and negative), and three
in the treble clef, the trinity. Two and three equal


THE MUSICAL OCTAVES

sive, the number of man's senses as developed at the
present time. A chord in music is composed of a
combination of tones which blend harmoniously when
sounded together, the lowest tone being the root or
keynote, and the other two notes forming the chord
must be in harmony with this one particular note,
else there will be discord as a result.
Everywhere in all nature we find tone manifested,
then number, then color, and then form; and this
without exception.
The first complete octave of the chromatic scale
containing 12 tones from which come all heavenly
themes, furnished the sound tones used during the
Saturn Period. During each of the Seven Periods our
life wave makes seven dips into matter and out again.
At the dawn of the Saturn Peried the Lords of
Mind (Sagittarius life wave) were the humanity,
the Archangelic life wave was in an animal-like
stage, the Angelic life wave was in a plantlike stage,
and our own life wave was in a mineral-like stage.
The lowest vehicle of each life wave was made of
Concrete Thought substance, and mau's only vehicle,
the germ of his present dense body, was made of that
substance also. With the various vehicles of these
four life waves-Lords of Mind, Archangels, Angels,
and our own life wave (Piscean) the Arian life
wave worked through the power incorporated in the
tone Db, the Taurian by the power produced by Eb,
and the Leos by the force contained in A#.
The Arian and Taurian life waves were the first
to appear to prepare proper conditions for the further
development of the four life waves evolving during
the Saturn Period. Then during the first dip (revo-
lution) of our own life wave (Piscean), when it had


38
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
reached the lowest point (Region of Concrete
Thought), through the power of the keynote A#
the Leos radiated from their own bodies into our
own the germ of our present dense vehicle. Later,
during our seventh dip (revolution) down into the
Region of Concrete Thought, this same life wave,
the Leos, by power of their keynote, A#, awakened
the hitherto passive force of our divine spirit. Human-
ity, then, at the close of the Saturn Period possessed
the germ of a dense body built of Concrete Thought
substance and an awakened divine spirit, which was
later to develop into will power.
During the Saturn Period the various involving
life waves began work in the Region of Divine
Spirit, then entered the Region of Life Spirit, then
the Abstract Thought Region, and last, the Region
of Concrete Thought (4). Following each complete
dip (revolution) into matter, 7 of them on 7 globes,
they rested in the Region of Virgin Spirits (1),
assimilating all they had contacted and preparing for
another Day of Manifestation. Four regions plus one
equals five, the number of Christ, indicating the
tremendous power this great Being was to become in
the scheme of evolution.
After all seven dips (revolutions) had been made
a long period of assimilation and rest followed where
all evolving life mingled freely from the highest to
the lowest, the high vibrations, by induction, raising
the lower ones to a considerable degree. This happens
between every one of the Seven Periods, Saturn, Sun,
Moon, Earth, Jupiter, Venus, and Vulcan.
The second octave of the chromatic scale fur-
nished the musical sounds used during the Sun
Period, and the first life waves to appear were the


THE MUSICAL OCTAVES
39
Leos, Lords of Flame, keynote A#, Virgo, Lords of
Wisdom, keynote C in second octave, Libra, Lords
of Individuality, keynote D, Scorpio, Lords of Form,
keynote E. Next followed Sagittarius, Lords of Mind,
keynote F, then came Capricorn, Archangels, key-
note G, next Aquarius, Angels, keynote A, then
Pisces, our own life wave, keynote B. The Archangels
were the humanity of the Sun Period.
During the sixth dip (revolution) which cur present
humanity took into matter, the Cancer life wave, the
Cherubim, whose keynote is G#, reappeared and
through the power incorporated in their keynote
awakened the hitherto passive force of our life spirit.
At the close of the Sun Period our life wave possessed
the improved germ of what was to become a physical
body, the germ of a vital body, an awakened divine
spirit, and an aroused life spirit which was later to
manifest as a wisdom-love force,
During the Sun Period the various involving life
waves began their work in the Region of Life Spirit,
then entered the Region of Abstract Thought, then
the Region of Concrete Thought, and last, the Desire
World Region. Following each complete dip (revo-
lution) into matter, 7 of them on 7 globes, they all
rested in the Region of Divine Spirit, again assimi-
lating all they had contacted, and preparing for
another Day of Manifestation. The lowest vehicle
of the evolving life waves was then composed of
Desire Region substance. Note that following the
close of the Sun Period came another great assimi
lative rest period.
The third octave of the chromatic scale furnished
the musical sounds used during the Moon Period.


40
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
At the dawn of the Moon Period, the various evolv-
ing life waves began to appear. The Lords of Wisdom,
Virgos, came first, bearing with them the germinal
vehicles of evolving man; the Lords of Individuality,
Libras, followed immediately and were placed in
special charge of the material evolution of the Moon
Period. Man's germinal dense body during the Saturn
Period began to evolve the sense organs. The music
was A#, the keynote of Leo (or Bb). To sharp a
a letter (or note) you strike the black key next
above it. To flat a letter (or note) you strike the
black key next below it. If the key of A# (or Bb)
was used to develop the sense organs in the germ of
the dense body, then the tones of the A# (or Bb)
scale can be used to advantage in continuing this
development. The A# scale contains four sharped
letters, A#, B#, D#, E#, and three double sharped
letters, F##, C##, G##. The chords are:

that the letters except for sharps and flats are exactly
the same. The letters flatted are B and E.

The Leos, Lords of Flame, exercised rulership
during the Saturn Period; and as their musical
scale, A# (or Bb), contained the sounds used to
arouse the divine spirit power which is will, then
these same tones are of immense value in further
developing this highest power of the spirit, the will.
In the second dip (revolution) in matter in the
Sun Period, the Virgo (Lords of Wisdom) life wave
radiated from their own bodies the germ of man's
vital body, including all the possibilities it possesses,
and implanted it in man's own body. The Virgo
life wave has C natural for its keynote; consequently
the chords belonging to this scale, the scale of C
natural, when sounded will help to further develop
the potentialities of the vital body. These chords are:

Some of the potentialities of the vital body are
growth, development of sense perceptions, propa-
gation, development and action of the glands, and
all the organs, in etheric substance, possessed by the
physical body.
During the sixth dip (revolution) into matter, in
the Sun Period, the Cancer life wave awakened the
germ of the life spirit. The keynote of Cancer is
G# (Ab) major, and it was the chord tones belonging
to this life wave that were used to obtain results. The
chords belonging to G# major are:

If the chord tones of G# (Ab) major awakened the
germ of the life spirit, then these same musical tones
will in turn aid in stimulating and developing the
potential powers of the life spirit.
The third octave of the chromatic scale furnished
the musical sounds used during the Moon Period.
In the Moon Period during the third dip (revolution)
into denser substance, the Libra life wave, Lords
of Individuality, radiated from themselves into our
form the germ that was later to develop into man's
desire body. The keynote of Libra is D major, and
it was the tones belonging to this scale, represented
by its chords, that were used to accomplish this
work. Th chords belonging to D major are found
in the scale using two sharps. The letters or notes
sharped are C and F. The chords of this scale are:

in developing the desire body according to the perfect

During the fifth dip (revolution) into denser sub-
stance in the Moon Period, the Gemini life wave,


THE MUSICAL OCTAVES
43
the Seraphim, reappeared and awakened the here-
tofore passive human spirit. The keynote of the
Gemini life wave is F# major. The letters sharped
are A,C,D,E,F, and G (all sharped except B). The
chords of F# major are:

The tones used to stimulate and assist in further-
ing the development of the human spirit are found
in the chord tones belonging to the key of F# major.
At the close of the Moon Period, the third great
cosmic day, we find the succeeding conditions:
The following life waves through the power of
their respective musical tones incorporated in scales
and chords worked on man's development-Aries
Db; Taurus, Eb; Gemini, F#; Cancer, Ab major;
Virgo, C natural; Libra, D major. As a result of their
work, spirit-man possessed awakened divine, life,
and human spirit powers, plus a dense, vital, and
desire body, all of which were very slightly de-
veloped, but were beginning to manifest. The tones
used by the life waves in their work are found on
the piano beginning with Do at the lower end of the
keyboard and extending to middle C in the middle
of the keyboard.
At this time man was still outside of his vehicles
and all work done by him was automatic, and directed
entirely by the great Beings mentioned above, who
were in charge of his evolution.


CHAPTER VII
OUR GROUP SPIRIT, JEHOVAH, AND OUR OWN
LIFE WAVE

TOWARD the end of the Moon Period there was
a division in the globe or planet on which we
were evolving, and this smaller planet was thrown
out into space. This planet condensed very rapidly
and remained the field of our evolution until the
end of the Moon Period.
In relation to this time Max Heindel says in sub-
stance: Fancy now an immense globe cireling in
space as a satellite about its parent globe. It is the
body of the Great Spirit, Jehovah. As we now have
soft flesh and hard bones, so also the central part
of the body of Jehovah was denser than the outside,
which was misty and cloudlike. And though his
consciousness pervaded the whole, he himself appeared
principally in the cloud and with him were his
Angels and other Creative Hierarchies.
From this great firmament of cloud depended
millions of cords, each with its own fœtal sac, hover-
ing close to the dense central part of the cloud.
And as the vital stream of the human mother cir-
culates through the umbilical cord, carrying nourish-
ment to the embryo during antenatal life for the
purpose of evolving a vehicle wherein the spirit
may dwell independently when the period of ges-
tation has been completed, so the divine life of
Jehovah brooded over us in the cloud and coursed
through the whole human family during that em-

bryonic stage of our evolution. We were then as
incapable of initiative as is the foetus today.
At the end of the Moon Period the divided parts
of the original globe were dissolved and merged into
the general Chaos which preceded the reorganization
of the globe for the Earth Period.
The Earth Period found the Virgo life wave, the
Lords of Wisdom, keynote C natural (also middle C
on the piano), in charge of the divine spirit, the will
power of man. The chords of C natural are found
in Chapter VI.
The Libran life wave, Lords of Individuality,
were now advanced far enough to have the second
power of man, the life spirit love power of attraction
and cohesion, placed under their charge. Their key-
note is D major and the chords belonging to D
major are also found in Chapter VI.
The Scorpio life wave, the Lords of Form, were
given charge of the third power in man, the human
spirit, which is his activity power and manifests
as fecundation the power to produce and grow.
The keynote of Scorpio is E majer, 4 sharps, C,D,F,G.

During the fourth dip (or revolution) into matter,
during the Atlantean epoch, the Sagittarian life wave,
Lords of Mind, radiated from themselves into our
being the nucleus of material with which we are
now seeking to build an organized mind. The mind
is formed of the substance of the four divisions


46
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
of Concrete Thought. The second region contains the
archetypes of universal vitality; the third contains
the archetypes of desire and emotion; the fourth
contains the archetypal forces of the human mind
the first, or lowest, region contains the archetypes
of form. The Region of germinal ideas in the Abstract
Thought Region is reflected into the first Concrete
Thought Region, the germinal ideas of life in the
Abstract Thought Region are reflected into the second
Region of Concrete Thought, and the Region of ab-
stract germinal ideas of desire and emotions is re-
flected into the third Region of Concrete Thought
In the latter part of the Lemarian Epoch a smal
part of our humanity were sufficiently advanceć
so that the germ of mind could be given to them.

tions are used in all occult orders and for all pur
poses. That in occult orders like that of the Rosi
crucians, the keynote of the incantation intoned a

one who has not the key and is therefore unable
to attune himself to it is halted, as it were, by
an invisible wall of vibration which surrounds the
Temple.
Max Heindel further states that music has a greater
mission than simply to provide enjoyment for us.
In fact, the Harmony of the Spheres is the basis
of all evolution, for without it there could be no
progress; and when once our ears have become attuned
to it, we have the "key" to all advancement. He
says that in the Second Heaven the Spirit knows
that the twelve life waves differentiated by God, and
the seven planets, form the sounding board and
strings of Apollo's seven-stringed lyre.
The Lords of Mind, Sagittarians, work only with
humanity on the earth plane, for they are concerned
with nothing lower than mind substance.
The Archangels are experts at body building out
of desire substance and are therefore able to teach
both man and animals in molding and using desire
bodies. The keynote of the Archangels, the Capri-
cornian life wave, is G major. It's scale has 1 sharp,

Every part of man's body has been built by the
vibratory keynotes of the twelve great life waves,
assisted by the Seven Spirits before the Throne,
namely, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus,
Mercury, plus Neptune's work, and that of the
earth's Moon. Man's spiritual powers have been awak-
ened by certain ones of the twelve great life waves
as mentioned in earlier chapters. This work has
been, and now is being carried on in all of mankind
regardless of the planetary Sun sign of the individual.
All of these great Helpers have been or are now
carrying on their activities under the direction of
the God of our solar system and are, so to speak,
His earth ambassadors.
The God of our solar system creates in life waves,
as stated. Twelve of these life waves have the same
names as the signs of the zodiac and will be used
by Him later as the signs of His own zodiac when
He breaks up into one to form the covering of a solar
system for another God.
The Aries and Taurus life waves are now in
the World of God Region; the Gemini, Cancer, Leo
life waves are in the World of Virgin Spirits Region;
the Virgo life wave is in the Divine Spirit World
Region; the Scorpio life wave is in the Abstract


50
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
Thought World Region; the Sagittarius life wave
is in the Concrete Thought World Region; the Capri-
corn life wave is in the Desire World Region; the
Aquarian iife wave is in the Etheric World sub-
division of the Physical World Region; and the
Piscean life wave is in the Chemical subdivision of
the Physical World Region. This does not mean
that the beings belonging to these twelve life waves
are confined within the limits of a certain World
Region. These regions are simply their home loca-
tions; they are at liberty to render service in many
other localities or on other planes, the same as
our own life wave, which at the present time during
manifestation functions in regions as high as the
World of Abstract Thought,
The closer we come to understanding creation,
the better we shall understand music, and vice versa.
For instance, a perfect chord is formed of the first,
third, and fifth letter or note in the scale. The letters
are C, E, G, the notes are do, mi, sol, both letters
and notes representing the same tones. To find the
planetary life wave spiritually ruling any period,
first note the human life wave of that period. The
Sagittarians or Lords of Mind were the humanity
of the Saturn Period. Now beginning with Sagit-
tarius ecunt up five life waves and we come to
the Leo life wave, or Lords of Flame, who had
charge of the spiritual impulses being played upon
the humanity of the Saturn Period. Remember that
the keynote of Leo is A# (Bb) major, the music of
which has to do with the work being done on the
growth of the dense body and the awakening of the
Divine Spirit. Accordingly, any music written in the
key of A# (Bb) will further work being done during
the Saturn Period.


OUR GROUP SPIRIT, JEHOVAH
51
The humanity of the Sun Period was the Capri-
corns or Archangels. Beginning here and counting
upward to five we find the Virgos or Lords of
Wisdom as the life wave in charge of the spiritual
impulses being played upon the humanity of the
Sun Period. The keynote of Virgo is C natural.
The special work being done was on the growth
of the vital body and the awakening of the life
spirit. Accordingly any music written in the key
of C natural will further the work begun in the
Sun Period.
The humanity of the Moon Period was the Aquari-
ans or Angels. Beginning with them and counting
upward to five we find the Librans or Lords of
Individuality life waves in charge of the spiritual
impulses being played upon the humanity of the
Moon Period. The keynote of Libra is D major. The
special work being done was on the growth of the
desire body and he awakening of the human spirit.
Accordingly any music written in the key of D
major will further the work begun in the Moon
Period.
The humanity of the Earth Period is the Pisceans,
our own life wave. Beginning with Pisces and count-
ing upward to five we find the Scorpios or Lords
of Form life waves in charge of the spiritual im-
puises now being played upon us, the humanity of
the Earth Period. The keynote of Scorpio is E
major. The special work being done during the
Earth Period is on the development of the mental
body. Accordingly any music written in the key of
E major will further the growth of the mind, which
is the work of the Earth Period.
The purpose of spiritual rulership is primarily


52
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
to give the necessary impacts which act as a stimulus
to action on the lower life wave on which the im-
pact is directed, all development being the result
of some kind of musical activity.
Summarizing the foregoing, we find :
Divine Spirit, keynote A# (Bb) major, ruling Life
Wave Leo.
Life Spirit, keynote G# (Ab) major, ruling Life
Wave Cancer.
Human Spirit, keynote F# major, ruling Life
Wave Gemini.
Physical Body, keynote A# (Bb) major, ruling
Life Wave Leo.
Vital Body, keynote C natural, ruling Life Wave
Virgo.
Desire Body, keynote D major, ruling Life Wave
Libra.
Mind, keynote F major, ruling Life Wave
Sagittarius.
The chords related to the three powers of the
Spirit and man's four vehicles, also all music written
in the keynote of the chords can be effectively used
in developing man's three spirit powers and the
powers of his four vehicles.

cession of the equinoxes. There is truly an infinite
variety in the Song of the Spheres, as indeed there
must be, for the constant change of spiritual vibration
is the basis of all physical and spiritual evolution.
In spring the tones of Aries and Mars, stirring, active
-conducive to germination, newness of life and
growth in all kingdoms, from man to plant inclusive,
predominate. If you would catch a faint idea of
what the Music of the Spheres is like at this time
listen to such Easter songs as:
Jesus Christ is risen today, Alleluia!
Our triumphant holy day, Alleluia!
Who did once upon the Cross, Alleluial
Suffer to redeem our loss. Alleluia!
Christ Jesus is the personification of spiritual love;
therefore music written in the key of Libra (D
major), ruled by Venus, the planet of love, is quite
in harmony with His vibration, and tends to lift up
and harmonize one's own vibration with that of this
great Being.
In midsummer the tones produced by Cancer and
the Moon take the lead, abetted by those of Leo and
the Sun, all of which are conducive to maturing the
processes started by the energizing spring tones.
Through the summer, love and life toil exceedingly
with joyful hearts, for they are Masters in the struggle
for existence while the Sun is exalted in the northern
heavens at the maximum of his power at the time of
the summer solstice. This is the time when the Christ,
having reached the throne of the Father (the World
of Divine Spirit) after completing His earth work
for another year, is welcomed by the heavenly host,
the Lords of Wisdom, who also abide there. In honor


54
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
of this great One who has given His life to the
point of exhaustion, it is appropriate that we join
that celestial band in singing:
All hail the power of (Christ) Jesus name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.
The keynote of Leo is A# (Bb) major. The Sun is
its ruler and its key word is Life. The keynote of
Cancer is G# major and its key word is fecundation.
In the fall the tones of Virgo, whose keynote is
C natural, and the key word of Mercury, reason,
energized by the tones of Scorpio, keynote E major,
and key word of Mars, dynamic energy, prepare for,
and meet the power of the approaching Christ ray
which is making its annual descent to the earth, and
whose powerful spiritual vibrations are in the earth's
atmosphere and capable of use by mankind to a much
greater advantage if they know the facts and re-
double their efforts to render loving, self-forgetting
service to others. Here are the words and music
which can be of great assistance to each one in further-
ing his or her evolutionary development:
O worship the King all glorious above,
And gratefully sing His wonderful love;
Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.
This is truly so; for all the while Christ is de-
scending to earth a harmonious, rhythmic, vibratory
song, a hosanna, is being sung by the celestial hosts,
which fills the earth's atmosphere and acts upon all
as an impulse to spiritual aspiration.

earth and starts on its outward journey toward
the earth's periphery, reaching it at the time of
the spring equinox. When the days are shortest
and the nights longest, on Holy Night, the Christ
Spirit ray reaches the very center of the earth. Here
He spends three days and nights liberating from
Himself the Holy Spirit germinating force which is
slowly to permeate the earth and fructify it for
another year.
Without this vitalizing, energizing power released
by the Christ the earth would remain cold, barren,
and drear; all living things would soon perish and
all orderly progress would be frustrated so far as
our present scheme of development is concerned. It
is most fitting, therefore, that at the holy Christmas
season we should pour forth our sincere appreciation
and adoration by joining the heavenly hosts in songs

of praise attuned to the celestial music given to us
by that master musician, the great Felix Mendelssohn
Hark! the herald angels sing,
Glory to the newborn King;
Peace on earth and mercy mild,
God and sinner reconciled;
Joyful all ye nations, rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With th'angelic hosts proclaim,

The Hierarchical life waves and the zodiacal signs
have not been the only aids that mankind has had in
furthering his evolution. The Seven Spirits before
the Throne, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Saturn,
Jupiter, and Uranus, have rendered and are still
rendering a great service to mankind and are at
present in very close contact with humanity. Each
of these planets has a keynote of its own and it is
through the vibratory power of each of these keynotes
that the planets are able to render assistance.
During the time the Spirit is coming to rebirth
it forms the creative archetype of its physical form
in the Second Heaven, the World of Concrete Thought,
with the assistance of the Seven Spirits before the
Throne. This archetype is a singing, vibrating model,
mould-a hollow cavity which is set into action by
the Spirit with a certain force commensurate with the
length of life to be lived on earth. Until the arche-
type ceases to vibrate the corresponding form which
is built of the chemical elements of the earth will
continue to exist.
The Region of Concrete Thought is the realm of
sound, where the Harmony of the Spheres, a truly
celestial music, pervades all that is there, as the

THE HARMONY OF THE SPHERES 57
atmosphere of the earth surrounds and envelops every-
thing here. All things there may be said to be wrapped
in and permeated with music--to live and grow by
music.
All of this clearly demonstrates that our earth music
did not just happen, but that it has been established
on a basis found in the higher spiritual worlds, the
origin of which is the spoken word of God, the
Creator of our solar system.
CHAPTER IX
THE ARCHETYPE AND THE PHYSICAL BODY
NOTE that the letters of the musical alphabet are:
NC,D,E,F,G,A,B, which form an interval of seven
tones, the basis of the Harmony of the Seven Spheres.
Uranus and Neptune's vibrations had no part in man's
material progress until much later than Pythagoras'
time. However, the most advanced of mankind are
beginning to sense their vibrations. The tones of
these two planets, added to the seven, make nine,
the number of humanity.
The seven major tones of the scale, when correctly
sounded, have within them the creative, building
powers of God. The manifestation of the minor tones
are subjective or assimilative in nature, and do not
create. The home of the 5 minor tones is the Third
Heaven (Region of Abstract Thought).
When the Spirit leaves the dense body at the time
of death it passes through the Desire World, the Con-
crete Thought World (Second Heaven), and Abstract
Thought World (Third Heaven), where it remains

58
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
for a time before it returns to rebirth on the earth.
When the time for rebirth comes, it leaves the Ab-
straet Thought World and enters the Concrete
Thought World.
There the Music of the Spheres at once sets the
seed atom of the dense body vibrating, and one of
these planets vibrates in particular harmony with the
dense body seed atom of the Spirit. Each planetary
tone is so modified that it conforms to the basic tone of
the planet in harmony with the dense seed atom of the
physical body of the Spirit, and is therefore the plane-
tary ruler of that particular earth life of the Spirit.
When the tones of the various planets impinge
upon the seed atom of the danse body they each in
turn aid in building the Spirit's archetype, and the
vibratory lines of force thus formed in the archetype
later attract and arrange in proper form the dense
atoms of the physical body. Thus both the archetype
and the physical body express accurately the Harmony
of the Spheres as it was played during this period
of archetypal construction.
The length of time which expires from the moment
the Spirit leaves the Third Heaven (Abstract Thought
Region), until it enters the body of its future mother
is much longer than the actual period of gestation
(9 months), and varies according to the complexity
of the structure required by the Spirit seeking
birth. Nor is the process of construction of the arche-
type continuous; for under certain aspects (squares,
trines, et cetera), the planets may produce notes to
which the vibratory powers of the seed atom cannot
respond; and again, the Spirit simply hums over
tones which it has already learned, and thus engaged
waits for a new sound which it can use to build

THE ARCHETYPE AND PHYSICAL BODY 59
more of the organism by means of which it desires
to express itself.
Time is also required to attract the needed mate-
rial in the various regions of the Desire World (7)
out of which to build a new desire body, the arche-
type controlling the quantity and the desire body seed
atom the quality. In the Etherie Region of the physi-
cal world not only must material be attracted for
a new vital body, but the Recording Angels and their
agents must separate a portion of this material from
the rest, out of which they form the etheric matrix
for the physical body which is to be built later.
Let us remember that we are now working under
the influence of the seven tones in the middle of
the piano keyboard, which is the middle octave,
there being three octaves on each side of it. The
lessons belonging to the three lower octaves we should
have completed. The lessons belonging to the middle
octave we are now learning. Note that the lessons
belonging to the lowest octave tones on the piano
keyboard, Saturn Period, were on dense body build-
ing (Leo keynote is A# (Bb) major) and the awaken-
ing of the negative powers of the Divine Spirit.
The lessons belonging to the second piano key-
board octave, Sun Period, were correlated to the
tones produced by that octave and were on vital
body building (Virgo, keynote C natural), and the
awakening of the negative powers of the life spirit,
Cancer life wave, keynote G# (Ab) major.
The lessons belonging to the third octave tones
on the piano keyboard, Moon Period. were correlated
to the tones produced by that octave. They pertained
to the building of the desire body (Libra, keynote D
major) and the awakening of the negative powers of

60
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
the human spirit (Gemini, keynote F# major).
The lessons belonging to the fourth or middle
octave tones, Earth Period, have to do with the
construction of the mental body and the development
of the mind; the most important of these tones to
present day humanity is F major, the keynote of
the Lords of Mind, the Sagittarians. Man having ac-
quired his dense, vital, desire, and mental bodies, must
during the Earth Period learn how to care for them
and keep each one in a healthy condition, which
depends almost altogether upon the state of mind.
Ordinarily the mind forms a perfect connection
between the Spirit and its four vehicles, but it is
possible for this connection to become faulty or even
entirely disconnected. Then serious mental trouble is
likely to be the result. Mental diseases are traccable
to the union of the uncontrolled mind with the
desire body, or the prolonged violent sounding of
any or all of the planetary vibrations either of the
Moon, Mercury, Uranus, or Neptune. Used in this
way they have the power to wreck not only the
mind itself but also the desire body, the vital body,
and the physical vehicle, while low, gentle, rhythmic
vibrations of those planets will both soothe and heal.

CHAPTER X
THE CURATIVE POWER OF MUSIC
IBRATION is life manifested, and is the origin
V
of all created things that are, or ever have been.
Inertia, its opposite, results in separation, disin-
tegration, and decay. Music and color are both the


THE CURATIVE POWER OF MUSIC
61
product of certain rates of vibratory power. Harmoni-
ous vibratory rates are healthful, constructive, and
building; but discordant ones are destructive and
disintegrating even to the point of dissolution. Sound
is the origin of color and only clear, melodious sound
can produce a beautiful, attractive, inspiring color.
The solar spectrum reflects seven distinct colors,
namely, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and
violet. There are seven tones produced on the piano
keyboard by the white keys of an octave, C corre-
sponds to red, D to orange, E to yellow, F to green,
G to blue, A to indigo, B to violet. When one musical
octave is finished another one commences and pro-
gresses with just twice as many vibrations as were
used in the first octave. Accordingly the same notes
are repeated on a finer scale. It is the same with the
scale of colors. When the scale of colors visible to the
ordinary eye is completed in the violet, another
octave of finer invisible colors, with just twice as
many vibrations will commence, and progress accord-
ing to the same law.
Aries has general control over the head and the
various organs within the head, and the eyes; but
the nese is under the rulership of Scorpio. Accord-
ingly a disease of any of these organs, except the
nose, will be benefitted by music played softly in the
key of Do major. Aries diseases are headache, neural-
gia, coma and trance conditions, diseases of the brain,
and cerebral hemorrhages. The remedy used to combat
these diseases is music played softly in the key of
Ab major.
Taurus rules the neck, throat, palate, larynx, ton-
sils, lower jaw, ears, occipital region of the brain,
the cerebellum, the atlas, cervical vertebrae, carotid


DIAGRAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1


CURATIVE POWER OF MUSIC
68
arteries, jugular veins, and some minor blood vessels.
Music played softly in the key of Eb major is of
great benefit when any of these organs begins to
show signs of disease. Taurus diseases are goitre,
diptheria, croup, and apoplexy. As each sign always
reacts upon the opposite one, afflictions in Taurus
may also produce venereal diseases, constipation, or
irregular menses.
Gemini rules the arms and hands, shoulders, lungs,
and the thymus gland, also the upper ribs. Any
disease attacking one of these parts may be checked
by music played softly in the key of F# major.
Gemini diseases are pneumonia, pulmonary diseases,
pleurisy, bronchitis, asthma, and inflamation of the
pericardium. Music played softly in the keynote of
F# major is beneficial in counteracting the activity
of these diseases.
Cancer rules the œsophagus, stomach, diaphragm,
pancreas, mamme, lacteals, upper lobes of the liver,
and thoracic duct. Diseases-indigestion, gas in
stomach, cough, hiccough, dropsy, gloom, hypo-
chondria, hysteria, gall stones, and jaundice. Diseases
mentioned under the rule of Cancer are counter-
acted by music played softly in G# (Ab) major.
Leo rules the heart, the dorsal region of the spine,
the spinal cord, and the aorta. Leo afflictions are
regurgitation, palpitation, fainting, aneurism, spinal
meningitis, curvature of spine, arteriosclerosis, angina
pectoris, hyperæmia, anemia, and hydræmia. Music
played seftly in the key of A# (Bb) major brings
relief to sufferers of these dieseases.
Virgo rules the abdominal region, the large and
small intestines, the lower lobes of the liver, and the
spleen. Afflictions of Virgo produce peritonitis, tape-

MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
worm, malnutrition, interference with the absorption
of the chyle, typhoid fever, cholera, and appendicitis.
The music best played to relieve any of the foregoing
afflictions is that of C natural softly rendered.
Libra rules the kidneys, the suprarenals, the lumbar
region of the spine, the vasomotor system, and the
skin. Libra diseases are polyuria, or suppression of
the urine, inflammation of the ureters which connect
the kidneys with the bladder, Bright's disease, lum-
bago, eczema, and other skin diseases. Music for the
treatment of these diseases is played softly in the
keynote of D major.
Scorpio rules the bladder, urethra, genital organe
in general, also the rectum and descending colon,
the sigmoid flexure, the prostate gland, and the nasal
bones, Scorpio diseases are nasal catarrh, adenoids,
and polypi, diseases of the uterus and ovaries, various
venereal diseases, stricture, and enlargement of the
prostate gland, irregularities of the menses, leucor-
rhœa, rupture, renal stones, and gravel. The keynote
of Scorpio is E major. Music played softly in this
key dispels Scorpio diseases.
Sagittarius rules the hips and thighs, the femur,
ilium, the coccygeal and sacral regions of the spine,
the iliac arteries and veins, and sciatic nerves. Music
played softly in the key of F major is the best
treatment for these diseases,
Capricorn governs the skin and the knees, and
also has a reflex action on the stomach which is
governed by the opposite sign, Cancer. Music played
softly in the key of G major is best for healing
Capricorn diseases, which are as follows: eczema
and other skin diseases, erysipelas, leprosy, and
digestive disturbances.

65
Aquarius rules the ankles, the limbs from the
knees to the ankles, and also has a reflex action on
its opposite sign, Leo; hence afflictions in Aquarius
produce varicose veins, sprained ankles, irregularities
of the heart action, and dropsy. The keynote of
Aquarius is A major. Music played softly in that
key is best for healing the diseases common to
Aquarius.
Pisces governs the feet and toes. It also has a reflex
effect on the abdominal region governed by the
opposite sign Virgo, hence afflictions in this sign
indicate trouble and deformities of the feet, intestinal
diseases and dropsy; also desire for drink and drugs
which may bring about delirium tremens. Music
played softly in the keynote of B major is best for
combating the diseases herein mentioned.

CHAPTER XI
INVISIBLE HELPERS AND HEALING
PIRITUAL healing as carried on by the Rosi-
crucian Fellowship is done by the probationers,
who work at night while out of their dense bodies
which are asleep. They are called Invisible Helpers,
because they cannot be seen by ordinary vision. Their
healing work depends on the following prime factors:
The vital body pitch of the patient and that of the
probationer Invisible Helper healer must be in per-
fect harmony. (This is taken care of by the Elder
Brothers.) The probationer Invisible Helper in his
or her waking consciousness must have decided to
S


66
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION ART
become a ready healing helper on the invisible plane
Such helpers must be probationers for the reason
that at the time they dedicate themselves to pro-
bationership they begin to vibrate in unison with
the Elder Brothers of the Rose Cross Order, and each
morning, when they perform their morning exercise
of concentration, they strengthen this vibration.
Invisible Helpers are of inestimable value for the
following reason: The vital body of the patient in
which the Helpers work has a tone all its own
(which is determined by the rising sign), and In-
visible Helpers are selected by the Elder Brothers
and sent to work on the patients whose vital body
pitch or tone is in perfect harmony with that of the
Invisible Helper selected. This is the key to the
success of Invisible Helper work. The probationer
Invisible Helper in his or her waking consciousness
has made up his mind to be a ready worker on the
invisible plane, and being attuned to the vibration
of the Elder Brothers, they, the Brothers, then
supervise the work.
This is the reason why a probationer nurse in
our own sanitarium is of inestimable value, for
note: such a nurse is tuned to both the keynote of
the patient's vital body and to the vibration (tone)
of the Elder Brothers, who are the head of all
the spiritual work carried on here. As no one ever
becomes an Invisible Healer until he or she has
made up his mind to become one, and since the devel-
opment of the mind is the principal work of the Earth
Period, it is quite necessary that we give some atten
tion to how mental development is accomplished.
No spiritual development can be accomplished
without the aid of the mind, for the mind is the


INVISIBLE HELPERS AND HEALING
67
link between the Spirit and its lower vehicles, The
Spirit's powers are developed by the soul essence,
pabulum, food extracted from the threefold body;
the mind is the only means of transmitting this
food essence to the Spirit. The more developed the
mind is, the more efficient it becomes as a conductor
of pabulum from the three vehicles, physical, vital,
and desire bodies, to the Spirit.
In the Earth Period the Lords of Mind radiated
from themselves into man's being the germ of a
mind. The keynote of the Lords of Mind (Sagit-
tarians) is F major. Its scale has one flat, namely Bb.
Any music written in the key of one flat will tend
both to influence and to develop man's mental powers.

The Spirit is entirely in the physical world while
it lives its earth life, except when the body is asleep
or unconscious for any other cause. During waking
hours the Spirit is indwelling and contacts the out-
side world consciously through the power of the mind.
The more developed the mind, the better the Spirit
is able to contact the outside world. At the present
time the mind is an unformed cloud which pere-
trates and surrounds the head. The mind has not
as yet evolved any organs. It acts like a mirror

68
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
reflecting the outer world and enabling the Spirit
to transmit its commands as thoughts and words,
and to compel action. The Spirit generates the
thought, and injects it into the mind, the mind passes
it on to the brain centers, and the brain centers
transmute it into incentive to action.
At the present time, however, the mind is not
focused in a way that enables it to give a clear
and true picture of what the Spirit imagines. It
is not one-pointed. It gives misty and clouded pictures.
Hence the necessity of experiment to show the in-
adequacies of the first conception, and bring about
new imaginings and ideas until the image produced
by the Spirit in mental substance has been reproduced
in physical substance.
At the best, we are able to shape through the mind
only such images as have to do with form, because
the mind was not started until the Earth Period
and therefore is now in its form or mineral stage;
hence in our operations we are confined to mineral
forms. We can imagine ways and means of work-
ing with the mineral forms of the three lower
kingdoms but car do little or nothing with living
bodies. It is true that we do graft living branches
to living trees, living parts of animal or man to
other living parts, but it is not life with which we
are working; it is form only. True, we are making
different conditions, but the life which already in-
habited the form makes the permanent connections,
and not the man. All forms created by man are life-
less and will continue to be so until the mind becomes
alive that is to say, until it reaches a plantlike
stage in its development.
Three of the ductless glands are closely con-

INVISIBLE HELPERS AND HEALING
69
nected with the mind of man. The seven duetless
glands, mentioned by Max Heindel as the seven
roses on the cross of the vital body, are all spiritual
centers correlated to Neptune, Uranus, Mercury,
Venus, the Sun, and Jupiter. Neptune is the ruler
of the pineal gland, Uranus of the pituitary, Mercury
the thyroid, Venus the thymus, the Sun the spleen,
and Jupiter the two adrenals. The keynote of each
of these planets by continually sounding its tone is
gradually awakening the corresponding spiritual
center in the gland to which it is related. When the
spiritual center in each of these glands becomes
aroused into dynamic activity, the seven ductless
glands will connect the Spirit with the invisible
plane to which each planet is correlated. The tone
of Jupiter, ruler of the two adrenals, will gradually
awaken and develop the potential spiritual powers
of these two glands and thereby assist man in learn-
ing the lessons belonging to the Chemical Region of
the Physical Plane. The tone of the Sun, ruler of
the spleen, will gradually awaken and develop
the potential spiritual powers of that gland and
thereby assist man in mastering the lessons pertaining
to the Etheric Region of the Physical Plane. The
tone of Venus, ruler of the thymus gland, will gradu-
ally awaken and develop the potential spiritual
powers of that gland and assist man in learning the
lessons pertaining to the Desire World. The tone
of Mercury, ruler of the thyroid gland, will gradually
awaken and develop the spiritual powers of that
gland and thereby assist man in mastering the
lessons pertaining to the World of Thought. The
tone of Uranus, ruler of the pituitary body, will
gradually awaken and develop the potential spiritual

the lessons pertaining to the World of Life Spirit.

N the evolutionary progress of humanity there are
four distinct classses of people at the present time,
namely: the failures, those who have definitely lost
out in the present scheme and will have to go back
to the beginning (another Saturn Period) and com-
mence all over again; the stragglers, who, if they work
hard enough, have a chance to catch up and go on
in our present scheme of evolution; the masses,
who are slowly learning their lessons and will without

of evolution. The last group are becoming teachers
and leaders of humanity. Chief among them are the
lay brothers, adepts, and Elder Brothers composing
the members of the seven Lesser Mystery Schools
and the five Greater Ones which exist on earth today.
In the far off past man's principal lessons were
related to body building, including the physical,
vital, and desire bodies, and while doing this work
he was directed and assisted by the eleven creative
Hierarchical life waves preceding his own and the

72
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
most advanced belonging to it also. From the Saturn
Period until the Lemurian Epoch of the Earth
Period man was hermaphrodite and able to produce
bodies through the dual power of his own creative
force, namely, his activity germinating power. He
was mindless and therefore did his work automati-
cally, the Spirit being entirely outside of its vehicles.
A record of all work done was, however, faithfully
recorded on the separate seed atoms of his three
vehicles—desire, vital, and dense bodies, which he
then possessed. There were only three seed atoms,
one for each of his three vehicles, until the germ
of mind was given which then made four vehicles
and four seed atoms. All bodies are built by means
of the power incorporated within its own particular
seed atom which is a minute, invisible, singing par-
ticle of spirit substance, and is the exclusive property
of the one to whom it was given.
When the members of our life wave had progressed
far enough to be ready for the next step in evolution,
there was a separation of the positive and negative
powers of the activity germinating force in each one,
half of which force was turned upward to build a
brain and larynx, and man then ceased to have
the power to produce rew bodies without the aid
of another human being. In half of the life wave
the positive life force was directed upward, and
in the other half the negative force was turned
upward. Those in which the positive force was turned
upward became known as females, and those in which
the negative force was turned upward were termed
males. As a result woman is positive on the mental
plane (Concrete Thought), and man is negative,


MUSIC AS A BUILDING POWER 78
while woman is negative on the physical plane and
man is positive.
One of the reasons for building a brain and larynx
was that humanity was about to be given the germ
of mind and needed a physical vehicle with which
to connect it with the physical world, which the Spirit
had not been able to contact hitherto except in a
dreamlike sort of consciousness. Another reason was
that ultimately the other power of the Spirit's activity
generating force was also to be lifted to the head
and the present organs of generation were to atrophy
and gradually become extinct. The Spirit would then
reproduce its dense vehicle through the power of
thought and the spoken word, using the brain and
larynx as its instruments.
The Spirit, guided and directed by the Angels,
built the brain and the larynx by the power of love.
The keynote of man is B major (5 sharps). The
keynote of the angels is A major (3 sharps), and
the keynote of the Lords of Mind (Sagittarius), who
radiated the germ of mind from themselves into us,
is F major (1 flat). Therefore these keynotes, their
chords, and any music written in the scale belonging
to the keynote of F major, B major, and A major
will assist in developing the powers of the mind
and the brain so that they can express the things the
Spirit wishes to objectify in the physical world.

It was intended by the Creative Hierarchies that
when man's brain was completed the Lords of Mer-
eury, Elder Brothers of our present humanity who
excelled in intelligence, should teach mankind how
to use the brain as a vehicle of the mind; but this
plan was frustrated by the Lucifer Spirits, who were
stragglers of the Angelic life wave. These Mars beings
gained access to man's brain through the medium
of the spinal cord, which they, being etheric, actually
entered; and now they rule the left brain hemisphere,
That part of the Angelic life wave that kept up


MUSIC AS A BUILDING POWER
75
with its work in evolution in the Moon Period
developed the power to reason and gain knowledge
without the use of a brain; but the stragglers of
the Angelic life wave, having rebelled against
Jehovah's evolutionary plan, did not develop this
power. In the Earth Period conditions had changed;
in order to evolve the power of reason and gain
knowledge, a brain was needed to connect the Lucifers
with the activities of the physical world in order
to evolve this power in them. Accordingly, as soon as
humanity developed a brain the Lucifers entering
mankind's spinal canal and thereby gaining access
to his brain (which connected him with the physical
world) called his attention to his physical body, of
which he had not hitherto been aware, and also to
the physical world around about him, in which he
was now to gain knowledge in order to continue his
development. This they did in order that they might
profit by it themselves, for having connected up with
man's brain they were then able to gain knowledge
as man acquired it and evolve thereby.
Mars works with the solar forces and his rays act
directly upon the third power of mankind, which is
activity. These rays, being positive, develop a strong
constitution, physical endurance, energy, courage, and
self-reliance. One of the manifestations of activity is
germination-a life force and into this force the
Martians instilled intense desire and passion, which
in turn aroused these emotions in mankind. This they
also did for a selfish purpose. The Lucifer Spirits revel
in the intensity of feeling and evolve by it. The nature
of the desire or emotion is not of importance to them,
but the intensity is. Therefore they stir up the human
passions of the lower nature, which are more intense

76
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
in our present stage of evolution than are our feelings
of joy or love.
According to the foregoing it will be noted that
the Lucifers gained connection with humanity for
two principal reasons, namely: that they might gain
contact with his brain and glean knowledge through
his experiences in the physical world, and that they
might induce strong passion in him and further
evolve by the intensity of feeling that it aroused.

CHAPTER XIII
THE BRAIN, MAN'S PHYSICAL WORKSHOP
HE brain is divided into three main primary
divisions, namely, the cerebrum (large upper
brain, the cerebellum (smail middle brain), and the
medulla oblongata (small lower brain).
The cerebrum is used by the Spirit to express
physical consciousness and direct thought. It is the
instrument used by the Spirit to express its highest
power on the physical plane--the will.
The cerebellum is the part of the brain which the
Spirit uses to bring about coordination in relation
to the movements of the body, combining the separate
nerve activities into balanced harmonious action
through the binding power of cohesion. The cerebellum
is correlated to the secord aspect of man, the wisdom-
love power.
The medulla oblongata is that part of the brain
used by the Spirit to control the heartbeat, the con-
traction of the blood vessels, and breathing. Without
T

MAN'S PHYSICAL WORKSHOP
77
this brain activity, the processes of physical life could
not go on. The medulla oblongata is therefore con-
nected with the third power of man, his activity
manifestation.
The brain is permeated by vital body substance,
desire body substance, and by abstract and concrete
thought substance. It is therefore the particular physi-
cal workshop of the Spirit with its own special mate-
rial and that of all its various vehicles cenveni-
ently assembled and ready for use. Impressions
made by the outer world reach the Spirit through
one or more of the five physical senses, by means
of the channel of the vital body.
The Spirit, the real man, is the thinker. The process
of thinking is as follows: The will arouses the imag-
ination, and it visualizes an idea composed of abstract
thought substance permeating the brain; this abstract
thought idea is then projected by the power of the
will on the mind lens, which transfers the idea to the
concrete thought substance contained in that part
of man's mental body permeating the brain. Here
the idea becomes clothed in concrete thought substance
and is now a thought form. The thought form thus
created is projected into the Desire Worid substance
permeating the brain. This Desire World substance,
being correlated to activity, gives the thought form
power to act, which usually results in some sort of
manifestation.
In the study of thought and the mind let us re-
member that thought is a power of the Spirit, and
the mental body or mind composed of concrete
thought substance, is the vehicle that connects the
Spirit with its etheric and physical brain. The
mental hody is attuned to F major or one flat, and

78
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
its scale begins with F. The vital body is attuned to
C natural, and its scale begins with C. The physical
body is attuned to A# (Bb) major which has two flats.
Therefore all music written in these three keys has
a decided effect on the mind, the vital body brain,
and the physical body brain, all of which are inti-
mately connected with the Spirit and the develop.
ment of its potential powers, namely, the will (Divine
Spirit power), wisdom-love (Life Spirit power), and
activity germination (Human Spirit power).
Thought is correlated to will, the first power of
the Spirit. It expresses itself first as an idea which
has not yet taken shape. Then the second power of the
Spirit, love, attracts to the idea concrete thought
substance and we have a thought form. A thought
form may be purely mental-that is, if it is untinged
with desire. However, in our present stage of evolu-
tion very few thoughts are free from some degree
of desire.
The World of Thought is the realm of music and
the home of the Sagittarian life wave, the Lords of
Mind; consequently it would be quite impossible to
produce a thought form apart from music. When
the thought form becomes clothed in desire substance,
color is added, as the Desire World is the realm of
color.
To summarize thought form building:
The Spirit arouses its will. The power of the wil
produces a radiating, musical vibration which mani
fests as sound. Sound produces an idea. The idea
takes shape, and a thought form comes into being
The thought form is colored by desire substance. A
colored floating form is produced. Thoughts are not


MAN'S PHYSICAL WORKSHOP
79
silent. They speak in a language which is unmistak-
able and conveys far more accurately than words
can what is their intent, until the force which their
originator expended to bring them into being has
been spent. As they sing in a key peculiar to the
person who gave them birth, it is a comparatively
easy matter for the trained occultist to trace them to
their source the originator.
Thought forms lack spontaneity; they act more
r less like automatons. They move and act in one
direction only, according to the will of the thinker,
which is the motive power within them.
No one who has not made a study of it can guess
how many people are activated by thought forms
which they think are their own, but which as a
matter of fact originated in the mind of someone
else. It is in this way that that which we call public
opinion is formed. Strong thinkers who have certain
definite ideas about some particular thing create and
radiate thought forms from themselves, and others
less positive or not antagonistic to the idea expressed
in those wandering thought forms catch them up
and think that the thoughts originated within them-
selves. Thus gradually a certain sentiment grows until
the thought originally started by a single individual
may become not only accepted, but advocated by an
entire community, state, or even a nation. Thoughts
expressed in spoken words become all the more power-
ful, particularly if uttered by a forceful speaker.
Thought forms decrease in power in proportion to
the distance traveled by them. The distance traveled,
and the persistency to become effective depend upon
the strength, definiteness, and clearness of the original
thought.


80
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
Generally speaking, thought forms may be groupea
in three specific classes: (1) A thought form may
be a likeness of the thinker. This often happens. A
person may long intensely to be in a certain place,
and as a result the thought takes shape and travels
to that very spot. Many untrained clairvoyants have
seen such thought forms of friends or relatives and
not knowing the nature of what they saw have been
greatly troubled by them. The trained clairvoyant
recognizes them at once. (2) The thought form that
takes the shape of some material object. For instance,
a person may think of a favorite book, and immedi-
ately that book, as he recalls it, appears in his aura
as the thought form of a book; or it may be a favorite
flower, or even a friend. The architect builds a
thought form of the house he wishes to construct, the
artist builds a thought form of the picture he wishes
to paint; the writer builds thought forms of the

Thought form built by envy and greed
characters, scenery, et cetera, which he wishes to use
in his book. Remember that it is the individual's will
that originates thought forms, and these thought
forms have a certain amount of will incorporated
in them. Frequently after they are created they keep
forcing themselves into the thinker's consciousness,
often to the extent of becoming quite annoying, par-

MAN'S PHYSICAL WORKSHOP
81
ticularly if the thinker has changed his ideas on the
particular subject they represent.
The only way to get rid of such unwelcome thoughts
is through indifference. If one tries to fight them, the
added force sent out
will keep them alive
and tend to bring
them to mind more
often. (3) Thoughts
that take a form en-
tirely their own which
expresses their inherent
nature. Thought forms
of hate take on hideous
menacing shapes; ang-
er forms sharp, pointed
figures; avarice and
envy form masses of
substance from which
hook-like projections
reach out as if to lay
hold on the coveted
object and draw it
within; love manifests
as rosy clouds; devo-
tion as beautiful ob-
jects shading from
light blue almost to white; prayer forms a funnel-
shaped figure reaching upward into space. All of
these thought forms appear to be filled with life and
vibrate at an intensely high rate. Of course, they
all have color and tone.
Prayer, and the response
from above
Thought forms directed toward an individual pro-
duce a most interesting result. Either they find en-

82
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
trance into the aura of the individual, or else they
rebound from that person's aura and return to the
sender. Every thought form carries a particular rate
of vibration, and can only affect an individual in
whom a like vibration exists. It a thought form is
generated by an evil motive and sent to some certain
person, if there is no like vibration within the person's
aura to whom it is sent, then it cannot affect that
person's aura at all. Consequently it returns to its
originator, rebounding with the same force with
which it was sent. All outside impacts reach the Spirit
of an individual through the vital body, the two
higher ethers of which, the light and reflecting, form
the soul body. It is this vehicle which repels all evil
thoughts, provided it is sufficiently organized, for
then it acts as a boomerang and recoils to the one
who sent the evil thought, bringing to him or her
the evil which the creator of the evil thought desired
to bring on the person to whom the thought was sent.
If the frequenters of low dance halls, gambling dens,
and similar places of iniquity could see the swarms
of evil thought forms darting hither and yon, and
hear the blatant, sensual, suggestive tones emitted
by them, they would flee from such places as quickly
as they would from a pesthouse, or a building infected
with bubonic plague; and well they might, for such
demoralizing vibrations serve no purpose but to in-
stigate evil and to strengthen it wherever it already
exists.

CHAPTER XIV
DEVELOPING THE EFFICIENCY OF
THE MIND AND BRAIN
UNFORTUNATELY at the present time none of us
is altogether good, and we cannot hide from our-
selves the fact that ofttimes the good we would do,
we do not, and the evil acts we should shun, we often
do. Far too often our good resolutions are not carried
out, and we do wrong because it seems the easiest
or most enjoyable thing to do; all of which points out
the fact that we are all activated to some extent by
the lower self; this opens up the way for evil thoughts
to reach us and try out their influence.
The great point to be remembered here is that
every act, either good or evil, is directed by thought.
Therefore each individual is assisting the work carried
on either by the good or the evil forces. It belhooves
us consequently to keep a constant guard over our
thoughts, for if they are righteous, our acts will
always be directed toward good.
There are four ways in which the mind, directed
by the Spirit, uses the brain as a vehicle of thought
expression, namely: (1) thought is thrown against
the desire body to impel action; (2) thought is im-
pressed on the brain by means of the blood, through
the agency of the reflecting ether; (3) the super-
conscious memory, which is inherent in the life spirit,
is able to impress itself directly upon the reflecting
ether of the vital body without the necessity of cloth-
ing itself in desire substance; (4) the life spirit can
flash its message directly to the heart, which instan-
83

84
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
taneously flashes it on to the brain by way of the
pneumogastric nerve.
The brain is built of practically the same sub-
stances as are the other parts of the body with the
addition of phosphorus, which is peculiar to the brain
alone. The proportion and variation of this substance
is found to correspond to the state and stage of the
intelligence of the individual. Hence it is of great
importance that the individual supply his brain with
this necessary substance. Most vegetables and fruits
contain a certain amount of phosphorus, and it is
found in considerable quantities in grapes, onions,
sage, beans, cloves, pineapples, and in the leaves and
stalks of beets, carrots, linseed (stalks), and parsnip
leaves. The method of acquiring phosphorus in large
quantity, however, is not by chemical metabolism, but
by an alchemical process of soul growth.
The phosphorus in the brain is the avenue of ingress
of the divine impulse. Literally it is the light bearer,
but not the light itself; that comes from the Spirit.
Consequently, in the measure that we become capable
of assimilating that substance (phosphorus) we be-
come filled with light and begin to shine from within.
Note, however, that phosphorus is only a physical
medium which enables the spiritual light to express
through the physical brain. The light itself is the
product of the Spirit, and is increased by soul growth
which enables the brain to assimilate an increasing
amount of phosphorus. Soul growth is accomplished
by loving self-forgetting service to others. The Bible
states that "Everyone that doeth evil hateth the light
(which will reveal it), neither cometh to the light,
lest his deeds should be reproved (by an enlightened
conscience). But he that doeth truth cometh to the

THE MIND AND BRAIN
85
light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they
are wrought of God."
Next let us note how the mind, which is the link
between the Spirit and the brain, may be improved.
(1) Concentration is one of the great helps, for by
this exercise the mind becomes one pointed; (2)
studies in abstract thought such as mathematics; the
study of periods, rounds, and revolutions in relation
to the earth's evolution. These free the mind from
the influence of the desire body; (3) by preserving
the fluidic state of adaptability; in other words, main-
taining an open mind, so that
it may not become crystallized
in one line of thought, but
may be ever ready to investi-
gate new ideas; (4) study of
religion, which emancipates
the mind from the influence of
desire, for it is of the utmost
importance that we have only
the right kind of thoughts
in our mind. Thoughts of like Thought form made by
character will be attracted to
a blessing
us by the thoughts already in our mind, and if our
mind is centered on spiritual things, like will attract
like, and our spiritual thoughts will not only grow
and increase, but they will become a power in the
world for good.
Powerful thought forms, be they gocd or evil, very
often become ensouled by elementals which by their
nature attract good or evil to us, thereby having a
really great effect on our well-being. In music the
major keys express joy, gladness, hope, cheerfulness,
aspiration. et cetera; while the minor keys produce


86
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
a wail of sorrow, a moan of grief, a sigh of depression,
et cetera. Naturally, elementals bright and joyous
are attracted to the good thought forms, which are
always symmetrical and cheerful in coloring, while the
low vibrating elementals are attracted to dull, gloomy
thought forms repugnant in shape and murky in
color. Then right within our aura they sound their
individual keynotes, filling our immediate atmosphere
either with brightness and joy, or else with gloom,
fear, viciousness, et cetera, as the case may be. What
is more, elementals throw out an odor that is all
their own. The major keyed elementals exude certain
perfumes like those given off by sweet-smelling flowers,
The minor keyed ones throw off a depressing, debili-
tating sort of odor similar to that of skunkweed,
and some of them smell almost as bad as decaying
bodies. The time has come when many of these thought
forms are seen in people's auras, and plenty of them
have been smelled.
Here is a fact well worth knowing. Thought forms
are kept alive and strengthened by a repetition of
the same thoughts which originally built them. If
the thoughts are not repeated, the forms gradually dis-
integrate and the elementals ensouling them go else-
where to set up housekeeping. Therefore we have it
in our power to get rid of both the thought forms and
the elementals that we do not wish to have about us.
Fear, worry, gloom, grouches, displays of temper,
et cetera, can so fill an aura with disagreeable sights
and smells that one can become a public nuisance. In
the light of the foregoing it is easy to understand
why the presence of some people buoys us up, while
others have a depressing effect on those who contact
them.


THE MIND AND BRAIN
87
We must not get the idea that all thought forms
vibrating to either major or minor tones are ensouled
by elementals, but some of them most certainly are
and when an elemental ensouls a thought form, if its
own vibration is cheerful, joyous, vibrant, it ensouls
a thought form vibrating to a major tone. But if its
vibration is gloomy, morose, sad, depressed, it is
attracted to thought forms vibrating to a minor key.
All of which is in harmony with the cosmic law of
like attracting like.
Thus it is evident that every individual has within
himself a picture gallery and a most complicated
musical instrument all his own. In fact he carries
around with him two distinct picture galleries: one
in the seed atom of his dense body, and the other in
his aura. The first mentioned he is able to conceal
within himself, but the second is in full view of all
clairvoyants who are able to see auras and thought
forms.
The quality of man's musical instrument depends
on his stage of development. Elementals, as we have
seen, respond to only one tone, either major or minor.
Man, on the other hand, has become able to respond
to seven distinet tones as represented by the seven
tones of the musical scale, i.e., C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and
many of their variations both in major and minor
scales.
The aura, we know, is composed of the vital, desire,
and mental bodies. Each aura has a basic color. Max
Heindel states that the basie color of the American
(white race) is orange. The color, however, continually
varies according to man's emotions.
For instance, take a belligerent individual endeav-
oring to incite a strike in a labor organization. Natur-


88
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
ally he is very much excited himself, and though the
basic color of his aura is deep orange, this color for
the time being will be almost obliterated by scarlet
of the brightest hue. The contour of his desire body
will be like the body of a porcupine with its quills
striking out in all directions, ready for battle.
Thoughts of fear and
worry in the aura turn
it to a steel gray color.
Those who have such
auras are called steel
men or women. They
are fearful of a thous-
and things that never
happen, crystallizing
an armor around them-
selves which appears
to protect them from
outside interference,
but which in reality
actually encloses all of
their own disturbing
thought forms within
Startled thought form
caused by fear
their own aura, there to be fed and enlivened by
each like thought generated by them, Such auras
are tuned to a minor key that sounds much like a
dirge which can be sensed by sensitive people and
often requires some time for them to throw off the
feeling of depression which it generates,
So strong is this saturnine auric barrier that it
seems to require a decided shock to break it up, some-
times even running to the necessity of taking such
persons out of their old environment and placing them
in an entirely new one. These people seem to have
drawn into a shell, so to speak, and their saturnine


THE MIND AND BRAIN
89
shell must be broken before it is possible to get close
enough to them to get them out of their pitiable state.
Sometimes a sudden fright forms this shell instan-
tanecusly, as often happens during terrific battles.
Then the victim is called shell shocked, the truth being,
in most cases, that the sudden terrific fear suffered
by the victim shocked certain of his nerves out of
their power of coordination necessary for clear think-
ing, leaving the poor victim as unable to help himself
as he would be to escape were he securely locked in
a prison cell. There are times when another severe
shock will break the shell and restore order and har-
monious rhythm in the disarranged nervous system.
Agam, time has been known to make the necessary
adjustment.
Every time thoughts of worry and fear are indulged
in they lower the vibration of all the vehicles of the
individual and this lowered vibration tends to congeal
the currents of the desire body and build this steel
blue shell in which the person who habitually fosters
fear and worry will some time find himself, shut off
from love, sympathy, and the help of all the world.
We ought therefore to strive to be cheerful even
under adverse circumstances lest we find ourselves
in this serious condition.
We may note from the foregoing that there are
different degrees to which this shell encasement may
crystallize and corresponding relief be given; but
the only positive safety lies in never allowing it to
get started. The effect of fear and worry on the desire
body is different from all other emotions, Ordinarily
emotion tends to excite the desire body and form
its currents into some particular pattern or shape
which persists until the emotion subsides. The effect


20
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
of worry on the desire body may be likened to water
which is about to congeal under a lowering tempera-
ture. Fear may be likened to this same water when
it has frozen, for the currents of the desire body are
almost motionless and it seems practically impossible
to arouse any other emotional activity in them. There
is nothing so effective as cheerful music to raise the
vibration of fear and worry victims, and it requires
an accelerated vibration to dissolve their self-made
steel shell. No individual can long remain gloomy
when his whole being is flooded with inspiring music.
Another kind of thought forms, frightful to behold,
is created by anger, hate, rage, fury, wrath, et cetera.
These thought forms produce lurid red currents in
the desire body filled with jagged daggerlike objects
which writhe and twist, and finally explode in the
aura, filling it with whirling forms of a dark, murky
red color. Anger raises the vibration of the desire
body without that vehicle having control of itself,
causing a temporary break between the Ego and the
mind on one side, and the desire, vital, and physical
bodies on the other.
All kinds of martial music are dominated by rhythm
and tend to excite the desire body into erratic activity.
Music in which melody and harmony predominate are
best suited to quiet the desire body when it is being
activated by evil incentives and restore it to normalcy.
Evil thought forms in the aura have a centrifugal
motion. Good thought forms have a centripetal move-
ment. Both good and bad thought forms are usually
keyed to major tones except those of gloom, depression,
fear, worry, grief, et cetera, all of which are minor
in expression.
As the thought forms of each individual are keyed


THE MIND AND BRAIN
91
to his or her particular keynote, the time is coming
when we shall all be able to trace every thought form
which we contact to its originator by means of its
own specific tone. Then truly, as the Bible states,
the things which we think are hidden shall be pro-
claimed not from the housetops, but from our own
individual aura.

CHAPTER XV

MAN'S VEHICLES, A COMPOSITE
MUSICAL INSTRUMENT

THOUGHT belongs to the highest power of the
Spirit, which is will. Therefore as the potential
powers of the will develop, so does thought power;
and the time is coming when man will be able by
means of thought power and imagination to speak
things into existence. All things in nature have been
spoken into existence by means of the Word of God
which was made flesh. Sound (music), or spoken
thought, will be humanity's next force in manifesta-
tion, a force that will make mankind creative God
men. But this step in advancement cannot be taken
until man's development in life's school has fitted
him to use this enormous power for the good of all,
regardless of self-interest. Therefore it is most neces-
sary that each individual learn for himself how to
accomplish this development in the quickest, safest
way. The method has been made known to man,
but it depends on the individual whether he or she
puts it into practice.


92
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
The potential powers of man, the Spirit, are will,
the power to do, to instigate action, wisdom-love,
the power of attraction, cohesion, and binding to-
gether, activity, the power of germination, creation,
and development. One of the greatest aids in assisting
the Spirit in developing its potential powers into
dynamic efficiency is music, for it manifests these
same powers of God in a perfected state. His will
power is expressed in melody, His wisdom-love power
is expressed in harmony, and His activity power is
expressed in rhythm.
Man's divine spirit power is correlated to will;
and the development of this power means the devel-
opment of his will. Man's life spirit is correlated to
wisdom-love, and the development of this power means
the development of his wisdom-love potentialities.
Man's human spirit power develops his ability to
create. Man's divine spirit power or will is correlated
to his physical body, his life spirit power is corre-
lated to his vital body, and his human spirit power
is correlated to his desire body. This makes three
direct sources from which the Spirit derives assist-
ance in the development of its potential powers.
There is no greater aid in the development of the
Spirit's potential powers than music, for it is com-
posed of the three parts which correlate it to the
Spirit's potentialities. Good music raises the vibration
of each of the Spirit's sources of development, namely,
the divine spirit, the life spirit, the human spirit,
and the link of mind which connects the Spirit with
its physical, vital, and desire bodies. The raising of
the vibration of these seven sources of power develops
the powers of the Spirit. But discordant, so-called
music lowers their vibration, a continuation of which

MAN'S VEHICLES
98
will result in loss of power and disintegration of
the four lower vehicles.
The following is a summary of why and how music
assists in developing the potential powers of the
Spirit:
The keynote of the Divine Spirit is A# (Bb) major
written in the key of 2 flats, and any music written
in this key therefore helps to develop the power of
the Divine Spirit by awakening it from a comparative
state of dorinancy. The chords of this scale are found
in Chapter VI. Abide with Me, and Onward Chris
tian Soldiers are two well known hymns written in
the key of Bb major.
The keynote of the Life Spirit is G# (Ab) major,
and its scale has four flats. Music written in this key
helps to develop the powers of the Life Spirit by
arousing them into activity. The chords of G# (Ab)
major are given in Chapter VI.
this germ carried the vibration keynote A# (Bb)
major of that life wave, the dense or physical body
of each individual vibrates in unison with the vibra-
tion of the Leo life wave. Therefore the keynote of
the dense body is A# (Bb) major and all music writ-
ten in that key helps to develop the dense body of
man. The A# (Bb) major chords are found in
Chapter VI.
As before stated, the germ of the dense body was
given to humanity by the Leo life wave; and as
this germ carried the vibration keynote A# major of
that life wave, the dense or physical body of each
individual vibrates in unison with the vibration of
the Leo life wave. Therefore the keynote of the dense
body is A# major and all music written in that key
helps to develop the dense body of man. The A#


94
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
major chords are found in Chapter VI.
The germ of the vital body was given to mankind
by the Virgo life wave. Accordingly the vital body
vibrates to the keynote of that life wave which is
C natural. All music whose keynote is C natural
helps to develop the powers of the vital body. The
chords of C natural are found in Chapter VI.
The germ of the desire body was a gift from the
Libra life wave and carries the Libra vibration which
is keyed to D major. Therefore all music written
in that key helps to develop the powers of the desire
body. The chords of D major are found in Chap-
ter VI.
The germ of the mind was given to humanity by
the Sagittarian life wave, and therefore vibrates to
their neynote, which is F major. All music written
in the key of F major helps to develop the powers
of the mind, which development is one of the greatest
accomplishments to be attained during the present
Aryan Epoch. A great deal of music is written in
this key, particularly songs both popular and re-
ligious; two of which are Work for the Night Is
Coming, and America. The chords of F major are
found in Chapter VII.
Music contains within itself the three great primary
powers of God, will, wisdom-love, and activity com-
bined; and it is this combined dynamic power that
has been used by the Creator from the beginning of
manifestation. John, the great revelator, tells us that
in the beginning was the Word; and Max Heindel
states that it is the majestic rhythm of the Word of
God that wrought the primal substance, arche, into
the multitudinous forms that comprise the phenomenal
world; and moreover, that this Word of God still

MAN'S VEHICLES
95
sounds, to sustain the marching orbs and impel them
onward in their circle paths; and that the Creative
Word continues to produce forms of gradually in-
creasing efficiency as a medium for expressing life
and consciousness.
It is the harmonious enunciation of consecutive
syllables in the Divine Creative Word that marks the
successive stages in the development of both the world
and man; and when the last syllable has been sounded
and the complete Word spoken, mankind will have
reached as near perfection as it is possible to do in
the present scheme of evolution.
That the whole solar system is one vast musical
instrument is a fact now known to all advanced occult
students. They further realize that the twelve semi-
tones in the chromatic scale are correlated to the
twelve signs of the zodiac and that the seven white
keys, or whole tones, on the piano keyboard are
correlated to the Seven Spirits before the Throne
commonly designated as Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, who work by means of
the vibrations sent out by themselves.
The advanced occultist likens the signs of the zodiac
to the sounding board of the cosmic harp, and the
seven planets to the strings, which planets emit differ-
ent sounds as they pass through the various zodiacal
signs and therefore influence mankind in diverse
ways.
An astonishing fact hitherto unknown and there-
fore unrealized is that each individual is in himself
a musical instrument, the various parts of his entire
composition being correlated through vibratory tones
to the Seven Spirits before the Throne and the twelve
signs of the zodiac, all of which are guided and

96
MUSIC AND EVOLUTION
directed by the Creator of our solar system. It is
for this very reason that music has such a tremendous
power in the development of man's potentialities.
Without it there could be no manifestation and there-
fore no progress. Here we find the occult reason for
the admonition of the illumined Ones, "Man, know
thyself;" for as soon as each individual comes into a
conscious realization of his own true self, he then
has in his possession the key to all future advancement.

When Light unveiled her radiant face,
And wrapped the world in her embrace,
When into space the planets swung-
This song the heavenly choir sung:
"O sacred pulse! O law divine!
All purpose and all power are thine,
For Life goes on forever."
