### <h3 id="dedication">Dedication</h3>

This modest little volume is dedicated to my beloved teacher, Max Heindel, for whose spiritual instruction the author owes a debt of sincere gratitude that cannot possibly be expressed in words.

### <h3 id="foreword">Foreword</h3>

The subject matter of this booklet was sent out by The Rosicrucian Fellowship in the form of monthly lessons. After the supply was exhausted so many requests came in for copies of them that The Board of Trustees decided to reprint the lessons in one volume in order that they would be available to all who are interested in the structure, function, and spiritual significance of the seven ductless glands herein discussed. The spiritual function of the glands as discussed in this work is based on extraordinary information given out by Max Heindel. The psychological structure and function is based on valuable information gleaned from the textbook on the ductless glands written by Dr. Louis Berman, to whom the author wishes to extend most grateful thanks.

Mt. Ecclesia, June 1940

### <h3 id="chapter-1">CHAPTER I: MAN'S DEVELOPMENT</h3>

```
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?

- Psalm 8:3,5. 
```

Before beginning these lessons on the ductless glands it would be well for us to briefly review the origin and constitution of man.

There is nothing in the universe other than pure spirit, and there never has been; but there are two forms or poles of spirit. One is positive, acting, directing, and the other is negative, passive, receiving, assimilating. This positive-negative spirit substance, its two poles working together, is all inclusive and has produced all that there is from the clod to God. All creation is in a state of ever becoming and perfection is the goal. The positive pole of spirit manifests as energy. The negative pole acts as its receptacle, and the two produce both life and form. Form, which is a lower vibration of spirit, is brought into being for the use of the spirit, and form and spirit evolve side by side.

God, the Creator of our solar system, has within Himself three great dynamic forces, which for want of better names we designate as will, wisdom-love, and activity; and by putting these forces into directed orderly action He created our solar system and all therein. The ultimate goal to be attained by each of His creations is Godhood. Each individual brought into existence by this mighty Being has within Himself in POTENTIALITY all of the powers of his Creator, including epigenesis, the spirit's power to inaugurate something entirely new; and the work of each is to develop these potentialities into dynamic forces like unto those of our great Progenitor. In man we speak of these potentialities as the divine, life, and human spirits. It means that man, who is pure spirit, has within himself three great spirit-force potentialities.

Man's latent potentialities are developed in two ways, namely, through his own efforts, and by the help of others, chief among which are great Beings who are far beyond him on the path of evolution.

Just as it is necessary to take food in order to develop the physical body, so is it necessary to give food to the vital and desire bodies. The vital body gets its food directly from the sun; the etheric spleen of each individual attracts as much of the solar life forces as it requires. In the Desire World there is an essence corresponding to the vital fluid which sustains the vital body, and in this elixir of life the desire body steeps itself while the dense body sleeps.

#### <h4 id="the-individual-work-of-the-spirit">THE INDIVIDUAL WORK OF THE SPIRIT</h4>

It was impossible for the spirit to develop its potentialities until it had built its three lower vehicles, the dense, vital, and desire bodies; for it is from them that it obtains the food on which to nourish and develop its potential powers. This food essence is called soul.

By right action in relation to external impacts, experiences, and observations the spirit automatically extracts the conscious soul essence from the dense body, and this pabulum or food develops the latent potentialities of the divine spirit into dynamic forces which manifest as will, intellect, knowledge, the positive force of its being, the father principle, the power to DO.

By discrimination in relation to the important, the essential, and the real things of life, and the unimportant, the unessential, and the unreal, the spirit automatically extracts the intellectual soul food essence from the vital body and this in turn feeds and develops into dynamic power and potentialities of the life spirit which are imagination, intuition, receiving power, power to assimilate, the mother principle, the love nature.

By a curb on animal instincts, devotion to high and lofty feelings, and emotions generated by right action and purifying experiences the spirit automatically extracts the emotional soul food essence from the desire body and it in turn nourishes and develops the human spirit potentialities which are creative power--both physical and mental, fecundation, expansion, germination, and growth, and develops them into dynamic forces under the domination of the will.

Much help is given to the individual by Great Beings through the ductless glands of which we will now make a study. A gland is composed of a mass of cells, and cells are composed of a thick, colorless, jellylike substance called protoplasm. Every gland might be likened to a chemical factory in which all cells are workers, and the product of the factory is its secretions.

The ductless glands have no openings, tubes, or ducts carrying their secretions away, but empty them directly into the blood and the lymphatics which permeate them. The ductless glands are often spoken of as the endocrine glands or the hormone producing glands. Endocrine is really a most convenient term as it stands for both the secretion and the gland, but the word hormone is applied specifically to the internal secretion and not to the gland. The hormone is a substance formed in one organ of the body and carried through the circulation of the blood to another organ on which it exerts a stimulating effect. The word is derived from a Greek verb meaning to arouse or set in motion. Without the endocrine substance suited to them no muscle nor cell would act. Without a supply of the endocrine phosphorus furnished by the thyroid gland no brain could function. The beat of the heart would not continue for a moment were it not supplied with adrenal secretion; and cases are on record of hearts that were pronounced "dead," but after being supplied with adrenal secretion beat again with regular rhythm.

It is less than fifty years since the scientists began a real study of the ductless glands, and most of the information that we have regarding them has been acquired during the last two and a half decades. What the scientists do not know yet is that the ductless glands primarily do not belong to the physical body at all, but are adjuncts to the vital body, set apart and crystallized to the necessary density in order that they may perform certain special kinds of work. The glands and the blood are the special manifestations of the vital body. Although each of these glands has a specific work to perform, when normal and in good health they all work together in perfect harmony. The ductless glands are of more than particular interest to the students of the occult for they may be termed in a certain sense "the seven roses" upon the cross of the body, and are intimately connected with the occult development of humanity.

The principal ductless glands are the pineal, pituitary, thyroid, thymus, spleen, and the two adrenals. The adrenals, spleen, and thymus gland belong to the personality. The pituitary and pineal are correlated with the spiritual side of the nature, and the thyroid forms a link between the two.

#### <h4 id="the-adrenals">THE ADRENALS</h4>

We will begin our study of the glands with the adrenals. They are a pair of cocked-hat shaped glands capping the upper end of the kidneys. They are easily recognized because of their yellowish fatty color. For centuries these important glands were not given a separate status as organs but were passed up as a part of the fat ensheathing the kidneys. In childhood and youth they are relatively larger and more prominent than in the adult. At all ages the amount of blood passing through the adrenals is very great in comparison with their size. Their tremendous importance in the body economy cannot be overestimated. The great value of these glands is better understood when it is known that death occurs very quickly after their removal.

Each adrenal is a double gland composed of a cortex or outer layer and a medulla or inner layer. The cortex is of the same kind of tissue that builds the male and female organs of reproduction. How closely the adrenals and the organs of reproduction are related is neatly pointed out by the fact of their common ancestor, the mesoderm, which forms the middle layer of the embryonic cell. All vertebrates have adrenal glands. The inner portion of the adrenals, the medulla, is developed from the ectoderm, or outer layer of cells which form the embryo. This is the same tissue that produces the sympathetic nervous system. The size of the adrenals is somewhat variable, but generally speaking they are about three inches long, an inch and a half wide, and weigh about a fourth of an ounce. Human beings have a larger adrenal cortex (outer layer) than any of the animals.

The adrenal cortex contains more of the phosphorous-bearing substances of the general nature of those found in the cerebrospinal nervous system than any other gland or non-nerve tissue in the physical body. During intra-uterine life the adrenals are large and conspicuous, in the first half of the second month being twice as large as the kidneys. Most of this relatively large size, which is in the human fetus only and not in other animals, is due to the enlargement of the cortex. Should this predominance of the cortex over the medullary portion not occur in the human fetus, that is, if the proportion should remain like those of the animals, the brain would fail to develop properly, and an entirely mindless monster would be generated.

The secretion of the cortex or outer layer of the adrenals is called interrenalin. This secretion stimulates a healthy growth of the brain and sex cells, develops great mental concentration and physical endurance, and generates a vigorous nervous and muscular constitution. It acts on the pigment cells of the skin, blunting their sensitiveness to light. In certain diseases of the cortex of the adrenals the skin becomes dark, pigmented, or bronzed. This condition is known as Addison's disease. Interrenalin neutralizes the acid formed in the body during digestion. Were this acid not neutralized it would quickly snuff out the life of the tissues.

The removal of the adrenal cortex influences profoundly the chemistry of the blood, notably the content of chloride, acid soluble phosphorous, and acid ions (an ion consists of one or more atoms and carries a unit charge of electricity or life force).

The adrenal cortex has an intimate relationship with the gray matter of the brain, and it also has a relation to sex and the chemical content of the blood. A defective adrenal cortex means an insufficiently developed brain and nervous system. So closely are the brain and adrenal cortex related that a normal human brain never develops without a normal adrenal cortex. Note that the adrenal cortex is also correlated to the voluntary nervous system.

The medulla, or inner portion of the adrenal glands, contains numerous nerve cells belonging to the sympathetic or involuntary nervous system. The secretion of the medulla is a nitrogenous substance called adrenalin. This secretion acts as a powerful stimulant on the heart, and has a reinforcing effect upon the entire body.

The amount of adrenalin present in the medulla in the blood issuing from the adrenals, and in the circulation in general is about one part to twenty millions while there is about a hundred thousand times as much stored in the glands as reserve. Profound emotions result in a decrease of it in the glands and an increase in the blood. Pain and excitement, especially fear and rage, cause a discharge from the glands. The entry of adrenalin into the blood causes a tremendous heightening of vigor, and a tensing of the nervous system. The nerve cells become more sensitive to stimuli, more sugar is sent into the blood from the liver, and more red blood corpuscles are forced into the circulation from the blood lakes of the liver and spleen. A redistribution of the entire blood mass takes place, a great deal of it being withdrawn from the internal viscera and dispatched to the brain and to the muscles attached to the skeleton. The heart beats more strongly, the eyes are enabled to see more clearly, the hearing becomes intensified, and the breathing more rapid; the temperature rises, and the skin gets moist and greasy. In case of fear the hair of the head and body often becomes erect.

This extra adrenalin in the blood produces a reinforcing action on the nutritive properties of the blood, the tone of the muscles, and the activity of the brain and sympathetic nervous system.

While the adrenals are thus stimulating the external muscles, they are having the opposite effect on the digestive organs; for the time being digestion is inhibited, for the Ego's whole attention is being centered entirely along another line of action, and everything nonessential or detrimental to the matter of the moment is inhibited, arrested, and suppressed.

In certain types of the middle-ages, a high blood pressure accompanied by a great capacity for work has been found to be caused by an overdeveloped adrenal cortex. The adrenal glands are often called the glands of combat and are masculine in their manifestation. In women where excess in development of adrenal cortex occurs there is a degree of masculinity which more or less neutralizes the specifically feminine influence of the internal secretion of the ovaries. Such women have a vigor and energy above the normal, and command responsible positions in society, not only among their own sex, but also among men. They are the ones who are likely to become professional politicians, lawyers, bankers, captains of industry, and directors of affairs.

In facing a crisis the adrenals function as the glands of combat. The more combative and pugnacious the animal or individual, the more adrenal activity it or he has. The adrenals are the glands of energy, the glands of emergency, and the glands of preparedness. Adrenalin, the secretion of the medulla, is the substance used for body mobilization at a moment's notice. It has a reinforcing action on the entire physical organization, adding strength, alertness, and both physical and mental activity. It gives force in combat and swiftness in flight.

Adrenalin is so powerful in its action that in solution of one part to a million, it produces physiological reaction. its effect on the small blood vessels is so tremendous that quite a weak solution will stop a hemorrhage when applied locally, and it is frequently used in minor surgical operations to prevent excessive bleeding; but owing to the fact that its effect lasts only a few minutes, the injections have to be repeated frequently. As the activity of adrenalin is regulated by the sympathetic or involuntary nervous system the secretion of it can be increased by the stimulation of these nerves along the spinal column.

Through repeated excitement, anger, rage, et cetera, the adrenal glands may be exhausted of their reserve supply of adrenal secretion; the amount secreted being insufficient if enough time is not allowed, between demands, for the glands to recuperate, the result being temporary or chronic adrenal deficiency. In a person so affected there appears a weariness, a sensitiveness to cold, cold hands and feet which are sometimes mottled bluish-red; a loss of appetite and zest of life, and a tendency to worry; also an inclination to weep on the slightest provocation.

A nervous breakdown may sometimes be traced to a lack of normal response to the needs of everyday life by the adrenals. In some cases mental and physical elasticity is totally lost, and even the slightest exertion along either line often causes so much worry and exhaustion as to be prohibitive. Sometimes such sufferers are obsessed by the thought that they have lost their nerve completely, and accordingly dread to commit themselves on even the most trivial subject. This vacillating frame of mind is so distressing that at times it arouses thoughts of suicide.

In certain disturbances of the adrenal glands, especially where there are tumors which supply a massive does of the secretion to the blood, peculiar sex phenomena and general developmental anomalies and irregularities are produced. If the disease is present in the fetus, manifesting before birth, there evolves the condition of pseudo-hermaphroditism. (The person is apparently but not actually hermaphrodite, as when in animals the sexual glands are of one sex while the other genitals are present, mixed or intermediate.) The individual, if a female, presents to a greater or lesser extent the external habits and character of the other sex so that she is actually taken for a man, although the primary sex organs are ovaries, often not discovered to be such except when examined during an operation or after death.

If the process involving the adrenal cortex attacks it after birth, the symmetrical correspondence and harmony of the primary sex organs and the secondary sex characteristics are not affected, but there follows a curious hastening of the maturity of the body and mind--a precocious puberty, with the most startling effects. A little girl two, three, or four years of age will within a few months after the appearance of the disease begin to exhibit the growth and likeness of a girl of fourteen or fifteen, developing the physical and mental qualities and attributes of an adolescent--a tot bewitched into puberty, so to speak. Again, a boy of six or seven years may suddenly in the course of a few weeks or months become a little man, robust, rather short and stocky, but mustached, with the muscular strength and sexual powers of a man and thinking a man's thoughts.

A case in point is that of little four-year-old Clarence Kehr of Toledo, Ohio, whose adrenal and thyroid glands got busy overnight and transformed him from an ordinary little boy into a juvenile Samson. Clarence was born in September 1924, and up to the age of three was apparently normal. Then almost overnight his voice changed from a childish treble to a husky baritone, and his small body began to take on a matured appearance. Very soon he began to look upon his brother of seven and sister of eight as small children, and sought the company of the fourteen and fifteen year old boys of his neighborhood. Clarence takes a keen delight in the fact that he is grown up, has to shave, is abnormally strong and can lift some two hundred pounds. Psychiatrists of the University of Michigan have made a special study of this boy's case. After making more than a dozen X-ray pictures of his head and subjecting him to very close observation for several days the scientists finally arrived at the conclusion that the lad's condition was due to "some dysfunction of the ductless glands." The following is an extract from a report made by Dr. Gordon Manac:

"Clarence Kehr, aged four years, has been observed in our clinic, and we have found that the child is a rare anomaly....X-ray studies of his bones reveal his frame to be that of a boy well beyond his chronological age. His physical condition apparently is excellent. According to our psychiatrists he is above the average in intelligence....We believe that the child's condition is due to some dysfunction of the ductless glands."

Clarence was on the Academy of Medicine stage during the meeting of the doctors to demonstrate his strength. He lifted heavy weights easily, and while the discussion was going on amused himself by pushing a grand piano about the stage.

Dr. Louis Berman in discussing like cases says:

"It is all as if into some fermentable medium or solution a little yeast were dropped that changed the quiet calm of its surface into a bubbling, effervescing revolution. It suggests at once that the transformation of the child into a man or woman must be due to the pouring into the blood and the body fluids of some substance which acts like yeast in the fermentable solution. The adrenal cortex is one source of the 'maturity producing' internal secretions. If trouble in the adrenals starts after puberty, phenomena of the same type as that of the girls and boys mentioned, but of a different order, exhibit themselves. Suppose a woman in the thirties, for instance, becomes affected. Slowly or quickly her body will be covered with an abundant growth of hair, more or less of a beard or mustache will appear on the face, the voice will become deep and penetrating, the muscles hardened, and she will show a capacity for hard physical labor. Menstruation ceases. Sexually she appears to be made over. Masculinity now predominates in her make-up. She will have to shave regularly, and is not bothered in the least by the lack of feminine charms, for the change in her physical organization makes her immune to feminine desires. The cause of such a transformation in one previously normal woman was found to be due to a tumor on the adrenal cortex."

### <h3 id="chapter-2">CHAPTER II: TYPES PRODUCED BY THE DUCTLESS GLANDS</h3>

In the case of the pure type, one particular gland, either by its excessive action or its subnormal activity exercises a dominating influence upon the traits of the individual; and either as the strongest link in the chain of glands or the weakest, it becomes the ruler and all of the others must accommodate themselves to its dominancy. Among all the others as the chief commander of growth, development, and normal function, it holds the balance of power. It dominates every emergency by its strength or weakness, and in this way it creates its own type of individual with characteristics and attributes peculiar to itself. The pure types are the adrenal, the thyroid, the pituitary, the pineal, and the thymus.

With a little practice each person representing a pure type can be readily identified as one passes him or her on the street, for each is stamped with identifying characteristics of figure, height, hair, skin, and temperament, with the corresponding ambitions, social inclinations, and even a predisposition to particular diseases. The various types differ in appearance as greatly as do different animals of the same genus. For instance, no one ever mistakes a mastiff for a bulldog or a fox terrier for a dachshund. Each has a distinctive size and shape, each has certain traits and characteristics, and each is built and organized in the most efficient manner to work out its own specific destiny in a particular way, all of which is true of glandular-typed people.

The distinctions are less marked among the mixed types and consequently they are more difficult to classify. In them there is a conflict as to which ductless gland shall dominate, and of course the combined action of the different glands results in a considerable modification of the primary characteristics. In some cases not only two but even three of the ductless glands strive for supremacy, and their combined action causes a modification in the primary glandular appearance. A compromise effect is then necessitated. Also it is possible for an individual to be under the domination of one gland during one period of his life, and under another at a later time. In such instances the gland ruling the early life will leave its impress on the earliest developing features while other signs will indicate the more recent influence. Such combinations are classified as the adrenal-thyroid type, the pituitary-adrenal type, et cetera.

#### <h4 id="the-adrenal-type-of-personality">THE ADRENAL TYPE OF PERSONALITY</h4>

The adrenal face is often dark or freckled, and tends to be broad and irregular, the head square-shaped. The low hairline makes the brow appear low, and there is considerable hair over the cheek bones. The skin is one of the chief clues to the adrenal personality; the epidermis is always more or less pigmented. Pigmentation is due to a deposit of dark-brown coloring matter of varying intensity in the skin. It is a well-known fact that skin pigment bears a direct relation to the reaction of the organism to light, especially the ultraviolet rays, to heat radiation, and therefore to the fundamental productions and consumptions of energy by the cells. The hair of the adrenal type is profuse, thick, dry, and coarse. It is most prominent over the chest, abdomen, and back, and it has a kinky tendency. It often has an unexpected color: an Italian's may be yellow or a Norwegian's jet black. Adrenal people have well-marked canine teeth. With a properly cooperating thyroid and pituitary the adrenal person is in possession of striking vigor, energy, and persistence. Such a one may easily become a progressive personality and a winning fighter who seldom loses his objective.

<img src="../../assets/mystery-of-the-ductless-glands/mdgen001.gif" alt="Adrenal Type" id="adrenal-type">

<p><cite>Adrenal Type</cite></p>

Among women the adrenal type is always masculine. If such a one is physically feminine, due to adequate feminine reactions on the part of the other glands, she will at least show masterful virile qualities. A few decades ago such women had to repress their inherent desires to fill positions that placed them before the public; but now they are striding forward and commanding responsible positions which carry high salaries. Dr. Berman suggests that the first woman president will probably be an adrenal type. Certain it is that individuals of this type are the good workers, the efficient directors; they are successful for the reason that they have a driving force within themselves that is ever urging them onward toward the acquirement of that which they desire. President Harding was a typical masculine adrenal-centered type, and Carrie Nation an excellent example of a feminine one.

The insufficient adrenal type is built along the same lines as the adrenal adequate, and may easily be taken for him; but he differs and contrasts strikingly beneath the surface. He is one, and perhaps the most frequent, variety of the neurasthenic. He is weak, lazy, irritable; has a poor appetite, and lacks response to stimuli of all kinds. Chronic indecision is one of his most prominent traits. Among his chief troubles are a fatigableness that goes with low blood pressure, lowered body temperature, and a subnormal ability to utilize sugar for fuel purposes. Children who have an insufficient adrenal supply cannot learn easily; their growth is slow, and they cannot be driven or hurried. Often those lacking adrenal secretion before puberty awaken to good energy when the rest of the endocrines develop, especially the sex glands. Therefore the outlook for such unfortunates is not hopeless.

Fear and anger arouse the endocrine glands into needlessly strenuous action, and frequent indulgence in either of these emotions will in time impair the efficiency of these glands. Then if an effort is not made to give them an opportunity to recuperate, this impaired condition will eventually develop into a state of permanent adrenal insufficiency, and the individual will find himself in a most distressing physical and mental predicament. Optimism, good humor, and faith in God vivify and strengthen the adrenal glands, imbuing them with power and adequacy.

Relative to the activities of the ductless glands, Max Heindel has stated:

"Science is gradually learning the truths previously taught by the occult science and their attention is being more and more directed to the ductless glands which will give them the solution to many mysteries, but they do not seem to be aware as yet that there is a physical connection between the pituitary body, the principal organ of assimilation and therefore of growth, and the adrenals which eliminate the waste and assimilate the proteins. These are also physically connected both with the spleen and the thymus and thyroid glands. It is significant in this connection, from the astrological point of view, that the pituitary body is ruled by Uranus which is the octave of Venus, the ruler of the solar plexus where the seed atom of the vital body is located. Thus Venus keeps the gate of the vital fluid coming direct from the Sun through the spleen, and Uranus is warder of the gate where enters the physical food, and it is the blending of these two streams which produces the latent power stored up in our vital body until converted to dynamic energy by the martial desire nature."

### <h3 id="chapter-3">CHAPTER III: THE SPLEEN</h3>

The spleen is the largest ductless gland. It is located at the left end of the stomach, between it and the diaphragm. It is bean-shaped and has a deep bluish-red color. It weighs from five to six ounces, is about five inches in length and three inches in breadth. It is soft, spongy, and fragile. Normally, the spleen is movable within certain limits. It moves with respiration or breathing. it may become greatly enlarged during disease, such as typhoid or malarial fever, or during a disease of the organ itself, such as leukemia, an affection in which the white corpuscles of the blood are greatly increased in number, accompanied by enlargement of the spleen itself. The spleen permanently enlarges during prolonged ague, and then becomes the so-called "ague cake." Enlargement of the spleen of infants is often due to syphilis, and if it occurs at the age of two or three months it is usually due to that cause. The spleen always enlarges during digestion. This gland is fed by the splenic artery, and its veins empty into the portal vein which discharges its contents into the liver.

The spleen appears in the embryo about the fifth week, as a localized thickening of the mesoderm, or middle layer of the embryonic cell. It is almost entirely surrounded by peritoneum membrane, and is held in position by two folds of this tissue. It is invested by two coats--an external moist, fibrous membrane, and an internal fibro-elastic one. The external coat is thin and smooth. The secretion of the spleen is called hemolytin and is the controller of the blood destruction. It also has a striking effect in stimulating the normal movement of the intestines. Cases of chronic constipation have been cured by the use of it. On the inner side of the spleen at a depression called the hilus the blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics enter or leave.

The spleen manufactures white blood corpuscles, stores up iron, has a strong influence on the nervous system (controls intake of vital sugar fluid which traverses the nerves), and aids in digestion by taking in more vital essence from the sun during this process. Removal of the spleen is not fatal. After its removal there is an overgrowth of the lymphatic glands which take over its physical work. The etheric spleen does not decay simultaneously with the amputated physical member, but continues its existence and carries on its vital functions the same as before. The spleen is the entrance gate for the solar force which vitalizes the dense body. Without this vital elixir no being can live.

From the spleen this sun force is sent to the solar plexus, where it meets the ether which has been extracted from the blood in the heart, and which, as soon as it is extracted, flows along the silver cord to the solar plexus where the seed atom of the vital body is located. This seed atom seems to have the same effect upon the ether as a prism has upon light, for the ether stream is refracted by it into the three primary colors: red, yellow, and blue. In people living the purely physical life, red overwhelmingly predominates; but as the individual advances spiritually, yellow becomes noticeable, and later, blue. The red stream coalesces with the colorless solar stream which constantly rushes to the solar plexus by way of the spleen, and it is the agent that changes this colorless solar fluid to a pale rose, and gives the entire vital body its tinge of delicate peach-blossom hue. From the solar plexus this fluid-like energy flows along the filaments composing the nervous system, and in this way it permeates every part of the physical body, energizing each and every cell with its life force.

When a person is in health this life energy is specialized by the spleen and extracted from the blood in such large quantities that it cannot all be used in the body, and therefore it radiates outward through the pores of the skin in straight lines or streams. It is the outpouring of this excessive vital force, radiating from the body, that drives our poisonous gases, inimical microbes, and effete matter, and in this way assists in preserving a healthy condition of the physical organism. It also prevents armies of disease germs which swarm about in the atmosphere from entering the dense vehicle. In this way it serves a most beneficial purpose even after it has been used by the body and is returning to a free state.

The trained clairvoyant often observes a curious and astounding sight when gazing at the exposed parts of the body such as the face and hands, when suddenly there commences to flow from them a stream of stars, cubes, pyramids, and a variety of other geometrical figures. These forms are atoms belonging to the chemical ether that have served their purpose in the body and are being expelled through the skin. Each figure floats away from the individual a short distance and then disappears. Their color is an amethystine blue.

After eating, the vital solar forces attracted by the spleen is consumed by the body in great quantities. The two lower ethers contain the cement which the nature forces (nature spirits, so-called dead, Lucifer spirits, and Teachers from the higher creative Hierarchies) use in building food into the physical body.

When the meal is heavy, the outflow of the vital fluid from the body is perceptibly diminished and does not then cleanse the dense vehicle as thoroughly as it does when the food has been digested, nor is it as potent in keeping out inimical germs. Therefore overeating renders a person more likely to catch cold or take disease. During ill health the spleen furnishes the vital body with very little solar energy, and at this time the dense body seems to feed on the vital body in consequence of which the latter becomes more transparent and attenuated in proportion as the physical vehicle exhibits a state of emaciation. As the cleansing vital radiations are almost entirely absent during sickness, complications then set in very easily.

Ordinarily if any part of the body or any organ is removed and there is no longer any use for the etheric counterpart, that part of the vital body gradually wastes away; but in the case of the spleen no such disintegration takes place for, as stated before, the etheric spleen has a great work to perform, and if the physical body is to live the former must of necessity remain intact and continue with its work, viz., the attracting of solar energy or force to the dense vehicle.

The glands are an adjunct to the vital body, but the desire body has gained a hold in the spleen and makes the white corpuscles there. The white blood corpuscles are destroyers. The desire body uses the blood to carry these tiny destroyers all over the physical body. They pass through the walls of the arteries and veins whenever annoyance is felt, and especially in times of great anger; for then the rush of forces in the desire body causes the arteries and veins to swell, and that opens up the way for the white blood corpuscles to pass out through the thin walls of these distended blood vessels into the surrounding tissue of the body, where they form bases for the earthy matter which kills the dense vehicle.

The desire body is constantly destroying and breaking down physical tissue, which the vital body is constantly building up; and it is the war between the two that results in consciousness in the physical world. The etheric forces in the vital body act in such a way as to convert as much of the food as possible into blood; and blood is the highest product of the vital body. Red blood corpuscles are circular discs, concave on both sides, and have no nuclei. They distribute oxygen through the body. The white corpuscles are irregular in shape, have nuclei, and are possessed of the power of amoeboid movement.

The way the desire body works in forming white blood corpuscles in the spleen is as follows: Evil thoughts, fear, and anger interfere with the power of evaporation in the spleen. The desire body seizes the opportunity and forms a speck of plasm, the sticky material of an animal cell, which becomes the foundation of the white corpuscle. This is at once seized by a thought elemental, which forms a nucleus and embodies itself therein. Then the elemental commences to live a life of destruction, coalescing with waste products and decaying elements wherever obtainable, making the physical body a charnel house instead of the temple of an indwelling spirit. Every white corpuscle which has thus been formed and taken possession of by an outside entity is to the spirit a lost opportunity; and the more of the lost opportunities there are in the physical body the less that vehicle is under the control of the Ego. White blood corpuscles are always present in large numbers in all diseases.

#### <h4 id="personality-type">PERSONALITY TYPE</h4>

The spleen has no personality type; but owing to the fact that it attracts an excessive amount of solar force during mealtime and digestion in order that the food eaten may be taken care of, the gourmand with his excess of fat and his unwieldy body might possibly be considered as the representative of a type which may develop if the appetite is not controlled; however, if control is used, a high type, forceful and strong will be developed.

### <h3 id="chapter-4">CHAPTER IV: THE THYMUS GLAND</h3>

#### <h4 id="the-gland-of-child-development">THE GLAND OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT</h4>

The thymus gland is situated in the chest between the two lungs and behind the upper part of the sternum or breastbone. It descends and covers the upper portion of the heart, overlapping the great vessels at the top of the latter. It is a brownish mass, which when cut, has the appearance of a sweetbread. It is placed over the trachea or windpipe. It rises as a growth from the wall of the third pouch of the pharynx (a funnel-shaped cavity in the alimentary canal beginning behind the mouth); it reaches its greatest at the beginning of puberty. At birth it weighs about half an ounce. At puberty it weighs a little over an ounce. It is about two inches in length, an inch and a half broad, and a fourth of an inch thick. It is readily found in dissection until the twentieth year. Its gradual disappearance thereafter is marked by a loss of glandular structure, which is replaced by fibrous and adipose tissue. Vestiges of the characteristic thymus tissue, however, persist and some of the secreting cells remain throughout life.

In the past it was believed that at puberty the thymus atrophied, but now it is known that some of its secreting cells persist throughout life. When too many of these cells persist, the gland becomes from five to ten times as large as normal and a number of other features become prominent which make the individual extraordinary, the victim of the "status thymicus," who amid the hazards of life will react in a most amazing way. This will be further discussed in this series of lessons under thymus personality. certain it is that the thymus is the gland that keeps children childish, and sometimes makes children out of adults. The arteries that supply the thymus with blood are chiefly from the internal mammaries, an indication of the close relation existing between the mother and child. The nerves, which are small, come from the sympathetic or involuntary nervous system and the tenth cranial or pneumogastric nerve.

During childhood the thymus is the organ that promotes growth of bones, but at puberty a decreased functioning begins. It is believed that the sex glands arising to functioning level at that time exert a restraining influence upon it.

The secretion of the thymus is called thymovidin, and is believed to be the controller of the growth of children. When an enlarged thymus is present in a newborn baby, the starting of the process of breathing, that is, the introduction of the infant to the oxygen in the air, may be an exceedingly prolonged difficult matter. Such a baby is said to be born blue; the breathing for days produces a harsh, whistling sound, becoming normal for a time, to be followed by spells when there is trouble in breathing, breathlessness, accompanied by blueness of the skin and threatened death. There are cases in which these spells have occurred after the child had appeared to be perfectly healthy. That an oversize thymus is responsible for such a condition has been shown by the relief obtainable by X-ray shrinkage of the gland or the surgical removal of a part of it.

When the body of a child is suffering from under-nutrition, there is a rapid decline in weight of the thymus. This proves that the size and condition of a child's thymus are an index of the state of nutrition of its body. it has been proved that underfeeding for four weeks will reduce the thymus to one- third its normal size. This gland appears to act as a storage and reserve organ, affording some protection against the limitation of growth on account of lack of food. It is an interesting fact that in exhausting or wasting diseases the weight of this gland sinks much more quickly than does that of the other glands. There are reported instances where developing children grew inches in height and expanded mentally when thymovidin was fed to them, when every other measure had failed. In France a study was made of over four hundred idiotic children with normal thyroids. The report on the investigation stated that over three-fourths of these unfortunates had no thymus gland at all.

The secretion of the thymus gland controls normal bone growth and muscular metabolism in some definite way during the period of childhood. This gland particularly influences the development of the adrenal cortex (outer part of it), the pineal gland, the thyroid gland, and the prostate gland. Thymovidin injection has a specific effect in relieving the fatigue of the voluntary muscles.

Removing the thymus gland of a young and growing animal produces an interference with its normal growth--a dwarfing, with changes in the skeleton resembling rickets. The bones become soft and bendable, and fractures occur easily. However, with the regeneration of small bits of the thymus that may have been left behind during the operation these symptoms disappear, and the animal becomes normal again.

The thymus gland grows rapidly during the first two years of a child's life. The reason for this is that the child is then nursed, and the vital ether contained in the mother's milk especially furthers the growth of this organ. The thymus gland of children nursed by a human mother is always larger than that of children brought up on the milk of animals, and such children are always more amenable to the control of anyone else. From the time when nursing is discontinued the disintegrating atoms of the thymus gland circulate in the bloodstream, and since they are impregnated with the vital ether of the mother obtained during the time of nursing the close physical tie between them remains until the gland has become greatly decreased. Children nursed on human milk have greater vitality than those brought up on the milk of animals, because animal ether is not permanently absorbed by the thymus gland as the human ether is.

The child does not manufacture its own red blood corpuscles in the same way that the adult does. The reason for this is that the positive pole or energy of the desire body of the child is comparatively inactive; in consequence of which this vehicle does not act as an avenue for the forces (Martian) which take the iron from the blood and change it into hemoglobin (the red coloring matter of the blood corpuscles). To compensate for this inaction there is stored in the thymus gland of the child a spiritual essence which is drawn from the parents at the time of conception; and this substance accomplishes the alchemistry of the blood temporarily for the child until the desire body becomes dynamically active which is about the age of fourteen.

The thymus gland controls the physical growth of children, the greater part of which takes place approximately before the fourteenth year of age. During this time it holds the other glands in check, delays puberty, and further normal brain development. There are cases, however, where, owing to a disease of the adrenal glands, the brain and generative organs mature in a few weeks or months before the body has time to properly develop; the stoppage of its growth at this time leaves it undersized although it may be symmetrically formed. These are exceptional cases, however. Ordinarily the thymus gland prevents any such phenomenon taking place.

When the persistence of the thymus after puberty is TOO GREAT, the gland being from five to ten times as large as normal, the individual develops a case of STATUS THYMICUS which is weirdly interesting. This condition tends towards producing the feminine expression of the male, and the masculine expression of the female. In other words it causes an arrest of masculinization or feminization, as the case may be, sometimes resulting in the peculiar complex that the man will desire the society of men more than that of women, and that women will prefer the society of women to that of men. Carried to the extreme this may result in Narcissism which is a love of oneself. Such people continually use the pronoun I; they love to preen themselves before mirrors, they delight in admiring themselves before mirrors, they delight in admiring their own hands, feet, in fact their entire bodies, and may often be seen patting themselves tenderly and smiling sweetly at their own mirrored images.

Sometimes this class of people have an irresistible urge to wear the clothes of the opposite sex. Some of them are satisfied with half-way compromises; but others are not content with half-way compromises; but others are not content unless they change their attire completely and pass as members of the opposite sex. This class of people are not pseudo-hermaphrodites; their sex development is perfectly normal. There is a case on record where one man lived 48 years dressed in male attire; then he changed to that of a female which he continued to wear until his death thirty-five years later. During all of his later life he was universally accepted as a woman, and it was an autopsy which disclosed the fact that he-she was really, so far as sex was concerned, a normal man.

This type of individual is misunderstood and misjudged; and usually a hopeless misfit in society; the result of which is that such persons ofttimes become disheartened and discouraged, take to alcohol or drugs, and eventually resort to suicide. However, there are those of this type who after a stormy life through the twenties, become adapted to their surroundings in the thirties, because the pituitary and the thyroid become more dominant in their activities, giving greater mental poise and stability. Thymo-centrics who combine brilliancy with instability, sometimes become famous adventurers and restless experimentalists.

The heart of the thymo-centric is small and the blood vessels remarkably fragile. This prevents the flow of blood from responding to an emergency and these people sometimes die suddenly owing to ruptures in their vessels caused by the attempt to force an excessive flow of blood through them. Any sudden shock, fright, or the administration of an anesthetic is likely to produce a collapse, in many instances resulting in death.

#### <h4 id="thymus-type-of-personality">THYMUS TYPE OF PERSONALITY</h4>

Up to the time the permanent teeth make their appearance the thymus is the dominant gland, and it is noticeable that the child's form in both sexes is very much alike. After this a gradual differentiation takes place although the change does not become marked until the time of puberty. Ordinarily from this time on the thymus functions less and less, and the other glands increase in their activity. But many times the thymus gland does not cease in its action, in which cases we have individuals whose whole life is dominated by this gland. Such people belong to the thymus centered type. The features of these individuals remain rounded and childlike; the children belonging to it are well proportioned and perfectly formed, with delicately chiseled features. The skin is transparent and flushes readily; the hair is long and silky. Such children are the embodiment of beauty. They are the "angel children" who are admired for the coarse conflicts of life and usually die young.

<img src="../../assets/mystery-of-the-ductless-glands/mdgen002.gif" alt="Thymus Type" id="thymus-type">

<p><cite>Thymus Type</cite></p>

The thymus type is essentially feminine. The figure, sometimes medium height, and sometimes tall, is slender, the limbs are rounded, and the entire body is gracefully formed. The skin is fine, delicate, and velvety, a dead white or peaches and cream, the hair soft and silky, with little or none on the face; the finely molded features are beautifully proportioned, the eyes blue or brown, with long lashes, the lips thin and the chin oval. Sometimes in the adult the chin is receding, and the mouth is not well formed. The teeth are milky-white, thin and translucent, scalloped or crescentric at the grinding edge.

We wish to reiterate that this type of individual does not have great endurance; and therefore the best of care should be given to the physical body.

### <h3 id="chapter-5">CHAPTER V: THE THYROID GLAND</h3>

#### <h4 id="the-gland-of-energy">THE GLAND OF ENERGY</h4>

The thyroid gland consists of two maroon colored masses astride the upper end of the windpipe, close to the larynx. These are connected just below the Adam's apple by a narrow isthmus of the same tissue. This gland arises from the same tissue and almost from the same spot as the anterior lobe of the pituitary body. it weighs about an ounce. Each lobe of the thyroid is about two inches in length, and from an inch to an inch and a quarter in thickness. The thyroid is almost the first organ to become distinct in the human embryo. It is first distinguished as a groove in the floor of the mouth as early as the third week in the life of the fetus, and by the time the embryo is a fourth of an inch long, the thyroid tissue becomes severed and the cavity closed up.

The importance of the thyroid is plainly indicated by the richness of its circulation. This gland receives about four times as much blood in proportion to its size as do the kidneys, which are noted for their high degree of functional activity. it is heavier in the female than in the male, and becomes enlarged during sex excitement, menstruation, and pregnancy. According to one noted authority, Gaskill, the thyroid was once a sex gland. Dr. Berman says: "In the lowest vertebrates and in the homologous tissues of the higher invertebrates the fractions of the thyroid are intimately connected with the ducts of the sexual organs. They are indeed accessory sexual organs, uterine glands, satellites of the sex process. From Petromyzon (lamprey) upward their relationship is lost. The thyroid migrates more and more to the head region to become the great link between sex and brain."

Max Heindel states: "During the early part of the Hyperborean Epoch, while the Earth was still united with the Sun, the solar forces supplied man with all the sustenance he needed and he unconsciously radiated the surplus for the purpose of propagation.

"When the Ego entered into possession of its vehicles it became necessary to use part of this force for the building of the brain and larynx, which was originally a part of the creative organ. The larynx was built while the dense body was yet bent together in the baglike shape already described, which is still the form of the human embryo. As the dense body straightened and became upright, part of the creative organ remained with the upper part of the dense body and later became the larynx.

"Thus the dual creative force which had hitherto worked in only one direction, for the purpose of creating another being, became divided. One part was directed upward to build the brain and larynx, by means of which the Ego was to become capable of thinking and communicating thoughts to other beings.

"As a result of this change only one part of the force essential in the creation of another being was available to one individual, hence it became necessary for each individual to seek the cooperation of another, who possessed that part of the procreative force which the seeker lacked.

"Thus did the evolving entity obtain brain consciousness of the outside world at the cost of half its creative power. Previous to that time, it used within itself both parts of that power to externalize another being. As a result of that modification, however, it has evolved the power to create and express thought. Before then, it was a creator in the physical world only; since then it has become able to create in the three worlds."

A comparison of the discoveries made by the modern scientist and those of the occult investigator given above reveal a startling corroboration relative to the earlier formation of the generative organs of the human race. Max Heindel stated in THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION that the occultist hails with joy the discoveries of modern science, as they invariably corroborate that which occult science has long taught; and it is a remarkable fact that almost daily the careful student reads somewhere of a scientific discovery which proves particular statements made long ago in the recorded writing of some of our foremost occult scientists.

It is believed by prominent biologists that the thyroid has played a prominent part in the change of sea creatures into land animals. Experimentally, thyroid has been used to transform one into the other. There is a small salamander that lives in the water and breathes through gills. Feeding this animal thyroid gland produces a change very quickly from a water salamander to a land salamander.

Both the thyroid gland and its secretion are used as medicine. The secretion of the gland is called thyroxin. It is a gelatinous substance containing a large per cent of iodine, also arsenic and phosphorous. Thyroxin depends on iodine for its activity. There are other substances in the thyroid secretion with functions of their own, but their work is secondary and obscure. Thyroxin produces results in doses amazingly minute compared with the quantity of whole gland necessary to give to a patient. Moreover, a dose of thyroxin appears to last an organism in need of it over a period of time, while the whole gland has to be administered continuously.

The thyroid is an energy gland, and its secretion is the controller of the speed of living. The less one has of this secretion the more slowly he lives; that is to say, the rate at which the chemical reactions go on that constitute the process of life, is dependent on the thyroid. When the reactions are speeded up more oxygen and food materials are oxidized, thereby liberating more energy, and the individual can think, feel, see, and act more readily. The thyroid seems to mix more oxygen with the cell food and at the same time frees energy to be used for heat and motion and other needs.

Dr. Plummer has shown that what would amount to a grain of thyroxin would more than double the amount of energy produced in a unit of time. This gives some idea of the power of this internal secretion and its importance to normal life. To be exact, one milligram of thyroxin increases the metabolic action two per cent. When thyroxin is administered in a single dose there is a distinct slowing down in the absorption of it by the tissues. A single dose does not reach its maximum effect until the tenth day. its effect continues for about ten days; then there is a decrease in the intensity for another ten days. Accordingly the length of time a single dose of thyroxin functions in the body is approximately three weeks. Any disturbance in the thyroid secretion in quantity, that is, too much or too little of it, or in quality, that is, an abnormal change in its chemical composition, produces serious results which cause the person such severe suffering that he becomes a burden to himself and others.

Not only is the degree of pressure energy in the cells of the body controlled by the thyroid, but the mobility of that energy is also controlled by it. Without thyroid secretion the output of large and rapid fluctuations of energy, and the elasticity and flexibility of energy mobilization for any sudden muscular act, let alone an emergency, would be quite impossible.

The thyroid is the most important gland in the body for the reason that it controls the growth of the dense vehicle, also mental development, and it is very closely related to all of the other six glands under consideration. It is the great link between the brain and the organs of generation, and manufactures the secretion necessary to give the brain balance.

Two of the principal disease connected with the thyroid gland are cretinism and myxedema. Both of these are cause by an imperfect connection between the brain centers and the vital body, which prevents the thyroid gland from secreting the thyroxin that would connect the thyroid with the brain and generative organs. Cretinism is infant idiocy. The same disease in the adult is called myxedema.

A child may be born a cretin as a result of thyroxin deficiency, or it may develop it some time after birth. A baby may be born which appears to be normal with the exception that the nose is a trifle more squat than the average. There may also be abnormal sleepiness, greater than that of the normal baby during the first month or two, and no spontaneous awakening for food. After some months it becomes noticeable that the infant is failing to grow at the normal rate both physically and mentally. An examination reveals a curious thickening of the dental ridges. Then the tongue becomes unusually thick and prominent, projecting beyond the mouth at all times, and interfering with breathing when the baby is in a reclining position. The mouth is always filled with saliva, the skin becomes yellowish or else takes on a waxy pallor, becoming dry, rough, scaly, and bloated. The eyes become watery and the lids thicken; the depressed pug nose is wide and the nostrils thick; the ears are large and stand erect; the hair is thin, the eyebrows and eyelashes scant, sometimes entirely absent; the nails are short, thin, and brittle; the teeth are late in appearing, usually consisting of a few short points, which are irregular and decay quickly. All growth, which is slow, is disproportionate. The trunk, though small when compared with the head, appears massive when compared with the diminutive extremities. The back is inclined to be humped, arching at the waistline; the abdomen protrudes like a small balloon, and often there is hernia at the navel. The hands and feet are floppy, broad, and thick, the fingers stiff, short and spade-like, and the toes are spread apart by solid skin.

These unfortunates manifest hunger and thirst by grunts, inarticulate sounds, or by screaming. They neither smile, laugh, nor cough. Their circulation is poor, the body cold, and the blood pressure low. All cretins do not have exactly the same peculiarities. There are many grades and varieties according to the severity of the disease.

Be it noted that in the case of the cretin or myxedemist the gate is closed that furnishes the creative force to the brain and the generative organs and both begin to atrophy. In both cases the victim is apathetic, indifferent, dirty, and awkward--a pitiful idiot.

In an adult one might be able to surmise some cause for such a loathsome disease, but why should it attack an innocent baby?

To find the cause of the affliction one must look to the organs affected - the brain and generative organs. The creative, growth-producing force is practically shut off from them.

The abuse of the creative force for the gratification of the senses is the sin against the Holy Spirit that is not forgiven, but must be expiated by living in vehicles the efficiency of which is impaired--a terrible lesson, and one that is never given to a Spirit to learn unless it has been found that it can get it in no other way.

Scientists all unknowingly are trying to outwit the working out of this great Law of Cause and Effect through rebirth by robbing the helpless animal kingdom of its thyroxin and feeding it to diseased man. But God is not mocked: Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap--and the feeding of animal thyroxin to a cretin or myxedemist will never effect a real cure. it only puts off the payment of the karmic debt until another time. The case is analogous to that of hypnotizing a drunkard to cure him of indulgence in strong drink. That which the hypnotist does is to superimpose his own will on that of the drunkard, and as long as the two are alive the cure seems to be complete; but should the hypnotist die before the drunkard, his will power no longer controls the other man's appetite and the latter immediately returns to his former unfortunate habit. it is only when we overcome a bad habit through our own will power that we have mastered it. The same is true of cretinism and myxedema. The victims may take thyroxin all their lives, but they are never cured. They have only put off the payment of a karmic debt until another life, and when they return the debt will again come up for settlement.

The first apparent success in curing myxedema was the case of an English woman forty-two years of age. The disease had produced a thickening of the face and hands, and had caused her to become slow of speech and gait, sensitive to cold, and languid and depressed in spirit to the point of inability to go about alone. The extract of the thyroid gland of a sheep hypodermically injected, twenty-four drops twice a week, gave almost immediate and marvelous improvement which continued steadily. It was found that this improvement could be maintained by feeding the gland by mouth. The features and skin returned to normal, and the woman became able to walk once more alone. She lived to the age of seventy-four years. during the time intervening between forty-two and seventy-four it was always necessary to administer thyroxin in some form regularly. The woman consumed nine pints of it, comprising the glands of eight hundred and seventy sheep.

When the cretin baby is given thyroxin its circulation improves and the body gets warmer. In a week or so the usual stupor disappears, and the little creature begins to resent disturbances; soon it begins to recognize its parents and smiles and plays. The heavy blank face becomes normal in appearance, and the entire body begins to grow. All kinds of marvelous growth effects occur. For instance, as many as twenty teeth may be cut inside of six months. Coarse, rough, dry, shaggy hair becomes fine, soft, silky, long, and often curly. The skin becomes moist, soft, and rosy. Inches in height may be added every month, and the child becomes bright, active, and begins to talk. A complete remaking is apparently effected. But should the administration of the thyroid secretion cease, almost immediately reversion to the original condition is inevitable. After a short time reactiveness slows down, the child will speak only when spoken to, will sit quietly in a chair all day long and act as if it were semi-anesthetized. Gradually the skin and hair return to the previous state, and the whole picture of the cretin is in full bloom. Supplying the secretion again promptly repeats the transformation.

Doctors are wondering what is to be the ultimate fate of these reformed cretins. Since the administration of thyroxin to these unfortunates has been going on scarcely a generation, there are no data yet as to the character of their children or their grandchildren. Those of whom the doctors have kept record appear to be normal healthy school children or adult workers, alive to the usual interests of childhood or adult occupations and social circles. Intellectually their only difficulty is with mathematics. Usually no one outside their family knows that they are cretins, and the most accurate observer in nine cases out of ten would never suspect it.

Not only may there be an insufficiency of thyroid secretion in the blood and tissues but there are instances where individuals suffer from an excess of it. When the over-activity of the thyroid reaches a pathological state the condition manifesting as disease is called exophthalmic goiter. This disease is usually accompanied by enlargement of the gland and may be acute in its onset or it may assume a chronic form.

Acute cases are usually caused by a severe shock or a great fright, and ofttimes disappear within a few days without any treatment. In the chronic form the disease is serious and should be given the best of care. Among its chief symptoms are excessively rapid heart action, pulse ranging from 90 to as high as 160, over-excitability of the nerves, increased blood pressure, shallow, rapid breathing; in fact, an over reactivity of the whole organism. The eyes, which are bright and prominent, are pushed forward in the sockets, and the lids are held wide apart resulting in a startled expression.

A person afflicted with this disease has a high warm color, is restless, does not sleep well, becomes thin and remains so no matter how much he may eat. In some cases there is extreme emaciation. The goiter may be very large, but at times it is only moderately so. There are twenty-one known different kinds of goiter. Exophthalmic goiter is curable in most cases without an operation, but the others usually require the use of a knife.

The cause of goiter is lack of iodine in the thyroid secretion. Iodine is rather abundantly present in sea water and in smaller quantities in the spring and soil water of most regions; but is some mountainous districts and in some other regions far removed from the sea, there is practically no iodine present for the thyroid to use. It may then enlarge in an effort to do its utmost to function properly under the existing circumstances; but still it cannot supply the secretion in the absence of iodine.

Iodine in the form of sodium iodide is small doses will act as a goiter preventive. Prolonged physical, mental, and emotional rest free from all excitement and worry is often most effective in curing this disease. A surgical operation should always be the last resort, and in no case should all of the thyroid be removed as the result would be certain death.

This mysterious gland which gives balance to the brain, aids in digestion, and mixes iron with the food cells, secretes the iodine which combats the poisons of the body, helps to control the amount of fat stored there, and in some mysterious way both prevents and cures goiter. The more thyroid, the more energetic one will be - the less thyroid, the less energetic and the lazier.

It has been quite conclusively proved that the prisoners in San Quentin convicted of murder all have abnormal thyroid glands, Dr. Ralph Arthur Reynolds, San Francisco physician, stated following a two months' firsthand study of the prison's inmates in cooperation with Dr. Leo Stanley, resident prison physician.

Dr. Reynolds said his study convinced him of three facts: That every murderer, potential and actual, exhibits over-secretion of the thyroid gland; that a murderer exhibits under-secretion of the pituitary gland, and that every social misfit displays malsecretion of some gland. The doctor told of one youthful slayer who for no apparent reason attacked other prisoners with anything he could lay his hands on and as a consequence had spent one hundred and eighty days in the dungeon. The youth had an abnormal thyroid gland, said Dr. Reynolds, upon which "we operated and reduced to what we thought normality. Today that prisoner is entirely tractable." The results, he said, were surprising in sixty other cases personally treated.

The following interesting statement is made by Dr. Louis Berman who displays remarkably keen insight in relation to the ductless glands and their function in the human body:

"If crime is an abnormality scientifically studiable and controllable like measles, court procedure and prison management will have to be transformed radically. There is scattered throughout the world now a group of people who are applying medical methods to the diagnosis and treatment of crime. They are the pioneers who will be remembered in history as the compeers of those who transformed the attitude of the world toward insanity and its therapy. The insane were once condemned and handled as are criminals in most civilized countries yet. The criminological laboratory as an adjunct to the court of justice, so called, like that associated with several courts punishing crime now, remains to be universalized.

"It has been shown that the greater number of convicts are mentally and morally subnormal (deficiency of thyroid secretion). To explain the subnormality, the criminologist has conducted and will continue to conduct investigations into the heredity and early environment of the criminal, his education and occupation, the social and religious influences to which he was subjected, and the intelligence test quotient. The conditioning of the vegetative system (involuntary or sympathetic) and the endocrine status of the prisoner, however, will without a doubt come to occupy the LEADING positions in any interpretation of crime in the future.

"Introspective observation of pre-criminal states of mind by so-called normal persons reveals that in many of them there is an impairment of reason and will power, in others an exaltation amounting almost to hysteria. What are these but endocrine states of the cells, experimentally reproducible by increasing or decreasing the influence of the thyroid, the adrenals, and the pituitary? Crimes of passion can be traced in no small part to disturbances of the thyroid. A psychological examiner of a Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) court, interested in this subject, has found enlarged thyroid in over ninety per cent of delinquent girls."

Before man became upright he was double-sexed and his entire creative force was centered in the organs of reproduction; at that time the thyroid was a sex gland pure and simple. Max Heindel says that when the sexes were divided one- half of the creative force of each individual was turned upward to build a brain and larynx. The brain was built to give the Ego an instrument with which to gather knowledge and create in the physical world, and the same force is feeding and building it today. The larynx was made in order that man might have an organ with which to express his thoughts in words.

The sex pervert or sex-maniac is proof of the correctness of the contention of the correctness of the contention of the occultist that one part of the sex force built and sustains the brain and larynx and that there is a connection between these organs and the force expressed through the lower creative organ. The unfortunate pervert becomes an idiot, unable to think because of drawing and sending out, not only the negative or positive part of the sex force (according to whether male or female) which is normally to be used through the organs of reproduction for propagation, but in addition to that he draws down and uses part of the force that should be turned upward and used in building the brain, enabling it to produce thought; hence his mental deficiency. On the other hand it the individual is given to spiritual thought the tendency to use the generative force for propagation is slight, and whatever part of it that is not used in that way may be transmuted into spiritual power.

#### <h4 id="comparison-of-thyroid-and-pituitary">COMPARISON OF THYROID AND PITUITARY</h4>

Again it is interesting to note that this same thyroid gland which was once a sex gland arises in the embryo from the same tissue and almost the same spot as does the anterior lobe of the pituitary body, the thyroid being an outgrowth in front, the anterior pituitary an outgrowth behind the same tissue. The anterior lobe of the pituitary body has been called the gland of intellectuality, meaning the capacity of the mind to control its environment by means of concepts and abstract ideas. All of which bears out Max Heindel's statement that the nature of the generative force is creative whether manifesting through the brain or the organs of reproduction.

The thyroid bears more directly upon the inner and outer coverings of the body, the skin, the skin glands, the hair, the mucous membranes and the irritability and the preparedness for response of the nerves. The pituitary acts more on the framework of the body, the skeleton, and the mechanical supports and movers. The thyroid raises the energy level of the brain and the whole nervous system. The pituitary stimulates the brain cells more directly. The thyroid facilitates energy production, the pituitary its consumption. The thyroid is concerned especially with the regulation of the shape, form, and finish of organs in accordance with their archetypes.

The life force necessary to create both thought and physical forms comes from the sun and the yearly liberated Christ force in the earth. This force is attracted to the individual by the thyroid gland. It is the spiritual solar life essence contained in thyroxin that gives balance to the brain and the life to the organs of reproduction. The secretion of this gland is as necessary to the proper mental activity and reproduction of species as ether is to the transmission of electricity. Without this spirit essence there can be no complexity of thought, no learning, no education, no habit formation, no responsive energy to meet situations, as well as no development of faculty and physical function; also no reproduction of any kind, with no sign of adolescence at the proper age, and no exhibition of sex tendencies thereafter.

#### <h4 id="thyroid-type-of-personality">THYROID TYPE OF PERSONALITY</h4>

During childhood the normal thyroid type of individual is healthy, slender, yet strikingly robust, energetic, active, fair complexioned, eyes large, brilliant with an inclination to protrude, nose straight and high-bridged, teeth firm, regular, and white with a pearly translucent enamel.

The thyroid-centered children are always active, never appear to get tired, and require little sleep. They are singularly immune to disease, contracting measles possibly, but seldom any other of the typical children's diseases. Adolescence is apt to be stormy and episodic for them and they find adjustment to the changes going on within them considerably disturbing which often results in acute wanderlust. The high-keyed cells of their bodies are so charged with vital energy that it must express itself in some normal activity or else explode.

The thyroid youth is a live wire, bubbling with vitality, vividly magnetic, and the life of any group. He is, however, easily shocked by some unusual or sudden event like the unexpected death of a beloved parent, or the ruin of a cherished ambition. In such cases a break in the balance of the other glands may follow quickly, resulting in disablement or possible invalidism, which may be cured after a time, or remain stationary, or in some instances descend to the worst form of thyroid deficiency. These attractive, lovable, thyroid-centered children need most careful rearing.

<p><cite>Thyroid Type</cite></p>

During maturity the thyroid type is characterized usually by a slender body. The features are clean-cut, complexion clear and slightly flushed, the hair abundant, often wavy or curled, eyebrows thick and long; large, frank, brilliant, keen eyes, a well-shaped mouth with regular, well-developed teeth. Shelley's face is a good example of the masculine thyroid-centered person. The oval shape of it, the excellent molding of its features, the wide, high brow, the large, vivacious, prominent eyes, vitally alive, and the sensitive mouth all belong to this type. of him Matthew Arnold said: "A beautiful and ineffectual angel, beating in the void his luminous wings in vain." Queen Elizabeth of England is an excellent feminine example of a thyroid-centered woman.

Sexually this type is well differentiated and susceptible. Noticeable emotivity, rapidity of perception and volition, impulsiveness, and a tendency to explosive crises of expression are among their distinctive traits. Their restless, apparently inexhaustible energy makes them perpetual doers. They get up early in the morning, work all day, retire late at night, and plan the work for themselves and others for the next day, and then complain of insomnia.

Shelley was only thirty years old when he was drowned yet the number of his literary compositions was greater than those of many who have spent a lifetime engaged in the same kind of work. Queen Elizabeth's reign was noted for its commercial enterprise and intellectual activity. Mankind owes much to these restless, energetic people, for in a certain sense they are the leaven that energizes the world.

### <h3 id="chapter-6">CHAPTER VI: THE PITUITARY BODY</h3>

The pituitary body or hypophysis is a lump of tissue about the size of a pea, situated almost exactly in the center of the head at the base of the brain and just behind the root of the nose. it hangs SUSPENDED from the under side of the brain like a cherry from the limb of a tree. It is a grayish-yellow color. It increases in size until about the thirtieth year, and in the adult weighs about five grains, or 1/1400 of a pound. During pregnancy the gland increases somewhat in size. It lies in a saddle-like depression in the sphenoid bone called the SELLA TURCICA and is enclosed in a strong membranous tissue called DURA MATER. The pituitary body can be traced from the most primitive form of life to man. Humanity has brought this gland and the salt of the blood in its development all the way from the sea to its present state.

The pituitary body is a veteran in the ductless gland system. Its name is derived from a Latin word, PITUITA. This name was given to the gland because it was supposed to secrete a fluid which lubricated the throat. it was believed that the secretion filtered through the porous ethnoid bone that intervenes between the pituitary body and the nasal cavity.

If the SELLA TURCICA, or cradle of the gland, is too small, there is an under development of the moral and intellectual sense. People so affected may be called pathological liars. Such unfortunates have no sense of truth, therefore they are absolutely unconscious of the fact that they are telling lies. Such an affliction may often be found among morons.

The pituitary body is composed of two seemingly independent organs, distinct in their origin, history, function, and secretion. In the study of the human embryo we find the beginning of the pituitary manifesting as an outgrowth of the mouth cavity in the taste and smell sense area. This outgrowth takes the form of a pouch which gradually extends toward the brain. by the end of the fourth week this protruding pouch contacts a downgrowth from the brain called the infundibulum. The two parts then develop into the adult pituitary gland. The outgrowth of the mouth cavity forms the anterior lobe of the pituitary, and the infundibulum part represents an outgrowth of the oldest part of the nervous system, the involuntary or sympathetic system, and develops into the posterior or post-pituitary lobe of the gland. There is a space between walls of the anterior parts of the gland which persists throughout life as the cleft of the gland.

At a certain stage in the life of the embryo the pineal gland protrudes through the brain, and the pituitary body forms an aperture to the mouth; the spinal canal cavity is also connected therewith. Through this media the spirit that is about to take birth in the physical world is still in close contact with the spirit world outside while the prison-house of flesh is being built around it. When other apertures of the body, notably the foramen ovale, close, the fetal blood stream is diverted from its former unimpeded way through the auricles of the heart directly to the spiritual centers in the head just mentioned, and the blood is forced through the ventricles of the heart into the lungs where it contacts the ether in the air. This ether contains an accurate and detailed picture of all the Ego's surroundings, not only of material things but all of the conditions existing each moment within the individual's aura, and all of these pictures are injected into the blood. This causes a clogging of the spiritual centers, spiritual sight wanes, and the consciousness of the Ego gradually becomes focused in the physical world.

At the beginning of serious gland study it was believed that the pituitary was s single gland producing only one hormone or substance. After a time it was found that it had two distinct parts and that each produced hormones distinctly different from the other. It was further discovered that what at first was considered to be one hormone was found to consist of two or more separate ones, until at present it is believed that the pituitary produces at present it is believed that the pituitary produces no less than eight distinctly different hormones.

The anterior lobe of the pituitary, called the pre-pituitary, is composed of a collection of solid columns of cells surrounded by blood spaces into which the cell secretion is undoubtedly directly poured. The posterior lobe consists of secretory cells producing a glossy substance which finds its way into the spinal fluid that bathes the nervous system.

There is one chemical in the secretion of the pre-pituitary that stimulates the growth of tissue, particularly the bony tissue, and another which influences the sex organs and sexual activity. One of the extracts of the prepituitary has a definite effect on the reddish-yellow mass which fills the egg sacs in the ovaries, stimulating them to excessive growth. One scientist who grafted small pieces of the prepituitary into very young immature animals found that it produced puberty and brought about active mature sexuality including all the mating and reproductive instincts.

In the light of the foregoing it is evident that the prepituitary is not only one of the chief controllers of growth but is the controller of the mysterious process in human development called puberty.

It has been proved by experimentation that the normal functioning of the prepituitary is necessary during the period of growth and development and probably also during the period of maturity for the proper evolution and functioning of the thyroid and adrenal glands. When the prepituitary is injured in young or growing animals there occurs a retardation of the growth and activity of the thyroid and adrenal glands as well as the sex glands. When the internal secretion of the prepituitary is supplied artificially by injection there is an activation of the thyroid and adrenal glands as well as the sex glands.

The internal secretions of the pituitary undoubtedly have an effect on the energy production, especially the energy of the central nervous system, the gray matter of the brain, and the spinal cord. An overproduction of energy in the body may be due to an excessive amount of the internal secretion of the pituitary circulating in the blood and tissues.

To summarize: The anterior or prepituitary produces a secretion that promotes the growth of the skeleton and connective tissues, causes the normal development of the creative organs and sex activity, and stimulates the well- being and action of the thyroid and adrenal glands. The secretion of the anterior pituitary, called prolactin, is essential to the production of milk in female animals.

The posterior lobe of the pituitary body secretes several important hormones, two of which are in frequent use. One of them, called pitocin, has a powerful stimulating effect on the pregnant uterus and is frequently used in cases where labor is slow and ineffective. The other hormone is called pituitrin. In general this secretion controls the tone of the tissues of the involuntary or smooth muscle fibres of the blood vessels, and the contractile organs of the body like the intestines, the bladder, and uterus. When injected it will slowly raise the blood pressure and keep it raised for some time, and will increase the flow of urine from the kidneys and milk from the breast. it will also cause an intense continued contraction of the bladder and uterus. It is believed to control the salt content of the blood on which its electrical conductivity and other properties depend. Normally, there is a certain fixed ratio of salts in the blood which keeps them (the salts) like the ratio of sea water. it has recently been proved that the blood pressure rising effect is due to one internal secretion of the postpituitary, and the contracting propensity is due to another constituent in the secretion.

Between the anterior pituitary and the posterior, there is an intermediate structure which secretes a hormone called intermedin. This secretion has proved very effective in the treatment of diabetes insipidus. It is generally administered by injection.

The extraordinary well protected position of the pituitary, its persistence throughout life, and its abundant blood supply emphasizes its vital importance. No other gland of internal secretion can adequately substitute it. Its complete removal means death in two or three days, with a peculiar lethargy, unsteadiness of gate, loss of appetite, emaciation, and fall of temperature so that the animal becomes cold blooded, its temperature the same as the atmosphere around it. If only a part of the anterior lobe is taken away there occurs a remarkable degeneration of the individual--a fatty degeneration with a tendency to inversion of sex. A singular drowsiness, dry skin, loss of hair, dull mentality, sometimes epilepsy, and a noticeable craving for sweets appears.

If a part of the anterior lobe is removed from a puppy in infancy there is a marked hindrance or slowing of growth - dwarfs are artificially created. Pathologists have shown that in several true human dwarfs the pituitary is rudimentary or inadequate. All this is evidence that the skeleton is directly under the domination of the pituitary.

There are singular by-effects of the pituitary in relation to the periodic phenomena of the physical organism, like hibernating, sleep, and wakefulness. An active pituitary produces sleepiness and general dullness. In hibernation or winter sleep, the animal in cold weather passes into a cataleptic state in which it continues to breathe, more deeply but more slowly than when awake, but shows no other signs of conscious life. A lowered blood pressure and a marked insensibility to painful and emotional stimuli go with it. There is a preliminary storage of starch in the liver and fat throughout the starch depots of the body. These are so like what happens when a part of the pituitary is removed that a comparison of the two becomes inevitable. Common to both conditions is a drop in the rate of metabolism, which can be relieved by injection of an extract of the pituitary causing a rise of temperature to occur at once.

The internal secretions of the glands of the hibernating animals show changes in all of them during the period of hibernating but most marked change is in the pituitary whose cells shrink as if they too were asleep or resting. These animals come to at the vernal equinox (spring) and the pituitary gland cells again become normally active. Some scientists claim that hibernation may be attributed to a seasonal wave of pituitary inactivity. In certain parts of Russia where there is a scarcity of food during winter months, the peasants pass weeks at a time in a sleepy, drowsy state, arousing once a day for a scant meal.

There are plenty of people in the world today who are partial hibernators, and many of them are really in a state of what might be called -- sub-pituitarism, for something is wrong with their pituitaries. They are slow, dull, sexually inactive, often sterile. They are sometimes tall but much more often they are dwarfish and are likely to be subject to epilepsy.

All grades of overaction of the pituitary exist. This overaction has the peculiar power to act as a stimulant to the growth of the bones and the soft supporting, connecting tissues, like tendons and ligaments.

If the excess of the pituitary secretions begins before puberty, it causes great elongation of the bones, resulting in giantism. Normal giants, persons exceptional in size and free from physical or mental deformities, are rare. There are, however, people with hyper-prepituitarism, who are possessed of the highest mental powers. In such individuals there is an increased activity of the posterior lobe in association with enlargement and hyperfunction of the anterior lobe. Their overgrowth is not so marked, and they are lean and mentally acute. The ordinary giant is one in whom there is degeneration of the pituitary after too much action of the anterior lobe and too little of the posterior. A tumor or diseased process in the gland is often responsible for this.

If the overaction of the pituitary happens after puberty when the long bones have set and cannot grow longer, a peculiar, widely spread enlargement of the individual's face and body occurs, especially of his hands, feet, and head. The nose, ears, lips, and eyes get larger and coarser. As these people are rather big and tall to begin with, the effect produced is that of a heavy-jawed, burly, bulky person, with bushy overhanging eyebrows and an aggressive appearance. Such people often suffer from torturing, boring headaches, a consequent despondency, and a feeling of hopelessness which colors their attitude toward life. Up to a certain point they have a remarkable alertness and are very capable. When conscious of the malady it is characteristic of them to meet it with a courageous optimism, although women so afflicted do occasionally commit suicide. In the semi-hibernators, who remind on of cattle, and the giant type, who remind one of anthropoids, there develops a distinct diminution of sexual life.

Oversecretion or undersecretion of the anterior gland may interfere with the proper functioning of the posterior gland, the secretion of which is a tonic to both the brain and the sex cells. In cases where the bony container is, or becomes, too small for the pituitary, along with undersize, obesity, et cetera, there develops conspicuous moral and intellectual inferiority. The person suffers from lack of self-restraint and an impelling desire to act according to whatever idea enters his mind, be it good or bad. Such people have little or no initiative and are instinctively immoral. They should have proper care.

The secretions of the pituitary act on the framework of the body-bones, ligaments, muscles, and tendons. Its secretions diffuse directly into the fluid bathing the nervous system, supplying beneficent stimulants, and aiding in the abstraction of harmful wastes. The pituitary secretion stimulates the brain cells directly, naturally, and normally in something like the way caffeine or cocaine stimulates them artificially.

The pituitary assists in energy transformation expenditure and conversion, particularly of the brain and sexual system. It works directly with the creative force both in the brain and reproductive organs, making it easy for them to consume energy. it is the gland of continued effort, and an inability to maintain effort is one of the prominent complaints when there is a destruction of this gland or insufficiency of its extract to enable it to perform its normal work. Overgrowth, undergrowth, and normal growth all depend on the normal functioning of the pituitary in relation to the brain and reproductive organs.

The prepituitary: (1) stimulates growth of skeleton and supporting tissues; (2) influences reproductive organs and their activity; (3) stimulates excessive growth of contents of egg sacs in ovaries; (4) produces puberty; (5) injury to it causes retardation of growth in young.

The postpituitary: (1) secretes pituitrin, which controls tone (vigor) of flat smooth muscles fibres of bladder and uterus; (2) raises blood pressure; (3) increases flow of urine, and milk in breast; (4) tonic to both brain cells and sex cells; (5) increases heart contractions but decreases force of systole.

<img src="../../assets/mystery-of-the-ductless-glands/mdgen004.gif" alt="Pituitary Type" id="pituitary-type">

<p><cite>Pituitary Type</cite></p>

The pituitary body is a feminine-masculine gland. The feminine pituitary type is dominated by the post-pituitary lobe of the gland. The masculine type is dominated by the anterior lobe of the pituitary. The feminine pituitary type expresses tender emotions and refined sentiments. The skin is soft, moist, roseate, or creamy, hairless, and flushes easily; the brow are high, the eyes are large and prominent. These people are fond of children, and are in every way most womanly. They are of medium height, well-formed, medium- sized hands and feet, well modulated voice, fond of good poetry and music, and have a sensitive face; are much interested in the welfare of mankind. They are womanly with a suggestion of masculine force. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is a good example of well-balanced feminine pituitary type. Florence Nightingale also belongs to this class.

An over predominant postpituitary in a woman produces one who craves excitement, constant change, and has a desire for some kind of new pleasure every minute. These women are excitement-mad and thrill-crazy.

The masculine pituitary type has superlative brain tone and action, a good all-around mental growth, and the ability to govern. Generally this type is tall, about sex feet, the ideal virile type, with a well-developed strong frame, firm muscles, and hands and feet proportionately sized. The head is long from front to back, the face sharp and clear-cut, the eyebrows thick, the eyes prominent and wide apart, and nose broadish and long, the lower jaw prominent and firm, cheek bones prominent. These people have a high brain power, great ability to learn, and the power to control. They are masters of their lower instincts, ruling themselves and their environment. To this group belong the brain men, practical and theoretical, the philosophers and creators of new thought. Men like Abraham Lincoln, Julius Caesar, and George Bernard Shaw belong to this class.

When a predominance of the post-pituitary occurs in men it produces a type that is short, rounded, and stout, the head appearing too large for the body, with the general distribution of the hair on the extremities and trunk poor, but that of the scalp and face plentiful, and early in life they acquire an abdominal pouch. They exhibit feminine tendencies, and often poetry and music have an almost morbid appeal to them. In fact a large number of poets and musicians are classified as feminine pituitary types. They are ofttimes beautiful characters, but usually lack self-assertion. They are often the henpecked husbands who should be understood - not bullied.

The anterior pituitary dominating in woman produces a masculine type and counteracts her natural feminine trend. It inclines her to be large, spare, and bony; gives her a protruding jaw, broad teeth, thick skin, a hairy body, and large hands and feet. However, it does give her a brilliant intellect which ofttimes creates despair in the minds of her masculine associates. Such women become the aggressive type, and fill men's places in the business world. These women also need understanding and not ridicule and sarcasm which is usually directed toward them.

Thrice blessed are the men and women who have normal, balanced pituitary glands.

### <h3 id="chapter-7">CHAPTER VII: THE PINEAL GLAND</h3>

The pineal gland is most astonishing in its nature. As its name implies, it is a cone-shaped body (Conarium pinealis, pine cone). It is reddish in color, about a half inch in length, and not much larger than a grain of wheat. It is attached to the roof of the third ventricle of the brain. It weighs about two grains. It is hidden away at the base of the brain (to which it is attached by the hollow pineal stalk) in a tiny cave behind and above the pituitary body. it is composed, in part, of nerve cells containing a pigment similar to that present in the cells of the retina which is an expression of the optic nerve-- this strengthening the argument for its ancient function as an eye. The lower part of the gland points backward.

The secretion of the pineal gland, called pinealin, acts as a restrictor for all the glands of internal secretion. By its checking activity on the other endocrine glands, it gives the baby time to grow in bulk, which is its chief business during the first two years of its existence. during these two years the baby should quadruple its birth weight. The pineal acts as a sort of general supervisor over all of the other glands.

The accepted belief of the nineteenth century anatomists was that the pineal gland was a useless, wasteful, space-consuming vestige of a once important structure. For a long time, in fact, up to a few decades ago, the pineal was believed to have no present function at all, or at least no ascertainable one. That it might be a gland of internal secretion was a popularly despised theory. Late observations, however, have related the pineal to muscle function. There is a singular muscle shrinking and deforming disease, known as "progressive dystrophy," the cause of which has been an unsolved mystery to the medical profession. By means of the X-rays, late studies of the pineal in relation to this disease have shown it calcified, that is, buried in lime salts, which signifies that where it is weak, or no longer functioning, the muscles do not receive the proper amount of nourishment.

It has further been discovered that the pineal regulates the coloring of the skin by varying the degree of light ray reaction. That is, it controls the action of light on the pigment of the skin. It is the light within that reflects the light without.

The pineal also produces the normal physical and mental development of the brain cells and the normal development of the cells of the organs of reproduction. The rich blood supply of the pineal is suggestive of its active functioning rather than that it is only the persistence of a vestigial organ which during the course of evolution has outgrown its original use.

To summarize: The pineal gland secretion (1) prevents a too early sex development in the child, and thereby promotes normal puberty; (2) it favors activity of the creative force, which tends to develop both the brain and the organs of reproduction normally; (3) it gives the vigor which tones up the muscles; (4) it influences the body by varying the degree of light ray reaction; that is, it controls the susceptibility of the body to light; (5) it influences the skin pigment by causing a marked transparency of it due to a contraction of the pigment cells.

#### <h4 id="the-pineal-type-of-personality">THE PINEAL TYPE OF PERSONALITY</h4>

Generally speaking, the pineal gland is masculine but there are some women who come under its domination, as we shall see when we take up the study of the spiritual activities of this organ.

<img src="../../assets/mystery-of-the-ductless-glands/mdgen005.gif" alt="Pineal Type" id="pineal-type">

<p><cite>Pineal Type</cite></p>

The typical spiritual pineal type is tall and has a well-built figure. The shoulders are square, and the body gradually tapers to the feet. The forehead is high and broad. The eyebrows are inclined to be straight, not too heavy, and are well shaped. The large, expressive, wide-open eyes are usually a deep blue, which, regardless of color, emit a glint of divine fire. The nose is quite Grecian in shape. The lips are medium full with a slight curve. The chin is well formed and prominent enough to show real strength of character, yet it is in excellent alignment with the other features. The neck is medium-sized, set on broad, shapely shoulders. The hair, usually light brown, is abundant and has a glossy sheen. As a whole, the figure is manly with a suggestion of feminine charm.

The artist Raphael was a perfect example of the spiritually developed pineal type. It is said that his manly beauty, touched with an almost imperceptible feminine allure, was so perfect that when he passed unobtrusively along the street all who saw him stopped and gazed after him in astonished admiration. In person he was as beautiful as an angel. His disposition was sweet, kind, and gentle; in manner and conversation he was most charming, and he was celebrated for the nobility and generosity of his nature.

The name of this unusual man still remains the greatest in the art of painting. In his TRANSFIGURATION the discerning eyes discover the mystery of his greatness, for here is plainly revealed his knowledge of and direct touch with supernatural realms. This marvelous picture, the beauty of which must be FELT as well as seen, was Raphael's swan-song on canvas. He painted it while he was dying. When looking at this marvelous production, one wonders if he did not paint that beautiful, holy, compassionate face of the Christ just as he saw Him in the ethers, waiting to carry into paradise the spirit of the noble man who had done so much for the glory of Christianity both by the unsurpassed holy pictures that he painted on canvas and the noble unselfish life he led.

### <h3 id="chapter-8">CHAPTER VIII: SPIRITUAL CORRESPONDENCES</h3>

We will now consider the spiritual connection which the ductless glands have with the development of the LATENT POTENTIALITIES of the Ego. Let us not forget that the principal ductless glands are seven in number, namely: the two adrenals, the spleen, the thymus, the thyroid, the pituitary, and the pineal. Max Heindel tells us that these glands have a great and particular interest for the occult student and that they may be termed the seven roses on the cross of the vital body, for they are intimately connected with the occult development of humanity.

All that we see about us in our entire solar system had been created by the WORD which is sound-music, the Voice of God. It was this great primordial Word which brought or SPOKE into being, in finest matter, all the different worlds with all their myriads of FORMS, and these forms have since been copied and worked out in detail by innumerable creative Hierarchies chief among which, so far as our won particular solar system is concerned, are the Seven Planetary Spirits before the throne, namely: Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Earth, Mars, Venus, and Mercury.

The Word of God sounds forth through the medium of these seven Planetary Spirits and forms all the various types which later crystallize into the manifold things which we behold in the Physical World. Thus we see that the Word manifests in seven great tones sounded by the seven Planetary Spirits. Each planet has its own keynote and emits a sound varying from that of every other planet. These are all building tones. All the music in the world is based on these seven tones emitted by the seven Planetary Spirits, and all form is created by them, and after the form is created they assist the indwelling Ego in developing its LATENT POTENTIALITIES, all of which are embryonic God-powers. This assistance is given to humanity largely through the medium of the ductless glands.

#### <h4 id="the-ductless-glands-and-their-rulers">THE DUCTLESS GLANDS AND THEIR RULERS</h4>

<img src="../../assets/mystery-of-the-ductless-glands/mdgen006.gif" alt="The Ductless Glands and Their Rulers" id="the-ductless-glands-and-their-rulers">

<p><cite>The Ductless Glands and Their Rulers</cite></p>

Each ductless gland has a dominant keynote within itself, which when awakened, will develop certain latent potentialities in the Ego. Each of these keynotes is attuned to that of one of the Planetary Spirits and the sounding forth of the keynote of that particular Planetary Spirit is gradually awakening the keynote of the gland which is attuned to it. When the keynote of the gland is awakened it will develop in the Ego the specific energies which this particular Planetary Spirit expresses. These energies are forces which the Ego must learn TO CONTROL and DIRECT, for according to their USE DO THEY MANIFEST AS GOOD OR EVIL. Remember that all evil is MISDIRECTED good.

#### <h4 id="adrenal-glands--physical-world--jupiter">THE ADRENAL GLANDS---PHYSICAL WORLD</h4>

The adrenal glands are ruled by Jupiter. The energies expressed by Jupiter manifest principally as benevolence, vision, expansion, optimism, honor, philanthropy, courtesy, generosity, cheerfulness, ability to comprehend the working out of cosmic law, ideation (the power to form and relate ideas), and religious understanding.

When one contacts the keynote of Jupiter it is found to be clear, full, round, and expansive. Its all encompassing power seems to enwrap and enfold the individual, awakening in him a sense of confidence, security, and the ability and desire to go out into the world and transform the hideous works of stumbling, half-awakened humanity into creations of beauty and intrinsic worth. His clarified vision beholds with joy the heights to be scaled, the greater spiritual powers to be developed; and his expanded consciousness, which recognizes in each of his fellow men just another part of himself groping and striving for a true understanding of the riddle of life, becomes fired with an urgent desire to render unto these hapless children of the one great Father, the loving, selfless service which will reveal to them, from the highest to the lowest, that the real purpose of life for each individual is the development of his latent potentialities into dynamic, godlike powers.

Once having attained these powers it is possible for the individual to misuse them. This is one of the greatest crimes that it is possible to commit. The wrong use of spiritual power is black magic which can be indulged in to the extent that finally the bridge of mind which connects the Spirit with its personality is broken and after a time the Spirit automatically gravitates to the planet Saturn where it leaves a record of its past lives and is then by dissolution of its vehicles propelled outward toward chaos by way of Saturn's moons, there to remain until the dawn of a new creative day when it will have to begin its work all over again in an appropriate day of manifestation.

The wrong use of these energies expresses itself principally in over-confidence, extravagance, self-indulgence, prodigality, showiness, bombastry, sportiness, conceit, lawlessness, dissipation, improvidence, and procrastination. All of which plunges the Ego into so much deep sorrow, suffering, and distress that in time it usually learns the lesson that only by the RIGHT use of these spiritual powers can it free itself from its self-made, distressful predicament. When this lesson is mastered, through pain and travail, the Ego is indeed ready for another forward step on the path of evolution. for, corresponding to the two adrenals, the FIRST TWO ROSES on the cross of his vital body HAVE BURST INTO FULL BLOOM!

No longer does the emergency energy of the adrenal glands express itself in belligerence, aggression, and combat, but rather it is directed by the power born in a chastened, contrite spirit into energies which manifest as benevolence, vision, expansion, and philanthropy.

A KNOWING that the GOOD OF ALL is the GOOD OF EACH has developed in the consciousness of the Ego. This individualized spark of God now recognizes the unity which exists between all created beings and their oneness with the great Creator of our solar system; accordingly, to him the brotherhood of man has become an established fact.

The work of Jupiter in relation to our humanity at present is connected with the physical plane. Through the medium of the spiritual power generated by the adrenal glands, he furnishes the Ego with the strength necessary to perfect its dense body and conquer the physical world, all of which completes its evolution on this mundane sphere. The spiritual center in the adrenals vibrates to blue.

#### <h4 id="the-spleen-etheric-region">THE SPLEEN - ETHERIC REGION</h4>

The spleen is the entrance gate of the solar forces specialized by each individual and circulated through the physical body as the vital fluid without which no being can live. This gland is therefore ruled by the sun which is the source of all vitality. The energies of this great planet manifest chiefly as will, vitality, individuality, authority, courage, generosity, dignity, loyalty, faithfulness, parental instinct, leadership, and responsibility.

When the great keynote of the Planetary Spirit of the sun, which contains within itself all of the other planetary tones, arouses into action the corresponding keynote in the spleen, the THIRD rose on the cross of the vital body BURSTS INTO BLOOM.

The development of this rose raises the consciousness of the individual to such an extent that he is able to contact the Etheric Region which is a vibrating, flowing stream of LIFE. Here he actually sees the activity that is carried on by a class of invisible hosts who work through the media of the chemical, life, light, and reflecting ethers. He sees the vital forces which give life to the mineral forms of plant, animal, and man actually flowing into these forms.

He sees the work of the forces that cause assimilation in the body and the process whereby they extract the different nutritive elements from the food and incorporate them into the bodies of plant, animal, and man, and he watches these same forces expel from the body the materials which are unfit for use. He learns that these processes like all others which are independent of man's volition, are wise and selective.

He learns of the activities of the nature forces which work in the life ether making it possible for parents to bring children into the world. He contacts the great angelic life wave and watches how they work with this same life force and the way in which they place the dense seed atom of reincarnating Egos, which are to grow new physical bodies, into the creative force of the prospective fathers.

He learns how the nature forces in the light ether produce heat in the blood, and how they operate the sense organs, making them capable of distinguishable sight, hearing, feeling, tasting, and smelling.

This same development enables the individual to contact the reflecting ether and see the pictures contained therein. In contacting this ether he discovers that it is through the activities of a certain class of nature spirits that the Ego is able to make thought impression on the human brain. while examining this ether he contacts those subtle powers of the Spirit known as the conscious and subconscious minds, and in time he learns how to strengthen the first and read the records contained in the second.

While exploring the Etheric Region the individual contacts Egos who are reviewing their after-death panorama and learns definitely just what the process is.

The new powers developed by the individual enable him to see the gnomes made of ether that work with the soil, and the fairies which work with the flowers; and he is able to watch these little creatures extract coloring matter from the light ether and build it into the various blossoms just before they are ready to burst into bloom. He is also able to see the sylphs in the air and follow the process they use in bringing about wind storms or zephyr breezes. He is able to see the salamanders who start all fires, and he can study their activities which produce the lightning and send it flashing in zigzag tongues of flame across the blackness of an inky sky.

To summarize: the powers developed through the influence of the sun upon the spleen open up to the individual the entire Etheric Region and make it possible for him to contact consciously all the denizens which inhabit that plane, and see the kind of work they are doing there as well as that which they are doing on the earth.

When these powers have been developed it is possible for the individual to put them to wrong use. He may get so enamored with himself that he becomes arrogant, overbearing, ostentatious, proud, pompous, domineering--a veritable despot. But if he does, again he reaps a harvest of sorrow and suffering until at last, humble and contrite, he becomes a most valuable SERVER ready and eager to apply his knowledge to the betterment of the world. The spiritual center in the spleen vibrates to golden yellow.

#### <h4 id="the-thymus-gland-desire-world">THE THYMUS GLAND - DESIRE WORLD</h4>

Venus controls the thymus gland. The emotions are developed by the Venus love ray. The seat of the emotions is the desire body, and the desire body connects the individual with the Desire World. When the keynote of Venus arouses into activity the keynote of the thymus gland, the individual develops the highest form of love, artistic ability, beauty, harmony, cheerfulness, charm, attraction, cohesion, and coalition.

The wrong use of these powers expresses itself as sensuality, dissoluteness, vulgarity, slothfulness, sentimentality, vanity, and inconstancy.

Again we sound the warning, that spiritual powers when once developed can be used for evil, and that the unfailing result IS ALWAYS DISASTER for the wrong doer. The temptation to use spiritual powers for personal benefit is ofttimes so subtle as to be almost indiscernible.

The keynote of the Venus planetary Spirit is sweet and clear. It brings to one who is able to contact it a feeling of unexpected happiness like unto that of an unanticipated family reunion where all past discords are forgotten and only the joy of renewed association prevails. When one begins to respond to this keynote, years seem to drop away from him and he feels young, joyous, and happy.

The keynote of Venus impinging upon that of the thymus gland begins to gradually awaken a response, and after a time this FOURTH rose on the cross of the vital body bursts into bloom. This accelerated vibration puts the individual in touch with the higher realms of the Desire World, where soul- life expresses in the beauty of living colors, in perfected form, in the poetry of motion, and the exquisite harmony of sound; where soul-light reveals to love its higher octave--altruism, and where soul-power manifests itself in philanthropic activities.

Here, also, the individual consciously contacts the archangelic life wave, of which Christ is the highest Initiate, and learns of its various activities, particularly of those which pertain to the work of the various group and race spirits who although unseen here are nevertheless very closely associated with the activities of animal and man. he watches the two great forces of attraction and repulsion in action, and sees the drawing power of interest and the withering effect of indifference. Here he learns a truth whose value is beyond all estimation--that NOTHING BUT GOOD ULTIMATELY SURVIVES, and all energy expended for any other purpose is not only wasted, so far as actual accomplishment is concerned, but that it reacts disastrously upon him who tries to divert its use for evil. The spiritual center in the thymus gland vibrates to yellow.

#### <h4 id="the-thyroid-gland-world-of-thought">THE THYROID GLAND - WORLD OF THOUGHT</h4>

The thyroid gland is ruled by Mercury's planetary Spirit. The powers of this great Being when developed in man, manifest principally as reason, intellect, thoughtfulness, good memory, studiousness, quick wit, eloquence, dexterity, self-expression through speech and writing, the acquirement of knowledge by means of reason, and self-mastery. the wrong use of these powers expresses itself chiefly as conceit, cunning, shiftlessness, carelessness, lack of principle, gossiping, profanity, dishonesty, gambling, indecision, and nervousness.

Mercury's keynote stands out clear and strong, and awakens in the individual a desire to know the reason for it all--why are we here? whence did we come? where are we going? who is God? and, what are the secrets concealed in His mighty creations? The thyroid is the FIFTH rose on the cross of the vital body. When its keynote is awakened, the individual, assisted by the music of the spheres, contacts the World of Thought where he consciously sees the archetypes of all that exists in the physical world, learns of their use, and how his own future lives are mapped out by the great recording angels. He contacts definite information relative to the Lords of Mind of which life wave the Father is the highest Initiate. He learns the nature of the germinal idea which produces form in the mineral, plant, animal, and human kingdoms. He discovers the germinal idea of life which manifests in plant, animal, and man; also the germinal idea which results in desire and emotion in animal and man. He sees how all these germinal ideas become archetypes or patterns in the Region of concrete Thought for all that exists in the Physical World, and that nothing manifests here until its archetype is created in the World of thought by the rhythmic power of the music of the spheres. Here he learns the value of thought and actually sees its power for good or evil demonstrated, and he now realizes how necessary it is for the Spirit to gain control of the mind and direct its activities in accordance to the divine plan governing evolution.

He now fully realizes that his own creative force is a God power implanted in him by his divine Creator; and that all this spirit essence that is not used for the building of bodies for incoming Egos, should be consciously directed to the brain, and there expended in forming those germinal ideas which, when developed into concrete realities are of such eternal value to his fellow men in developing their own divine potentialities into that dynamic spiritual energy which is so necessary for the overcoming of evil and the promotion of good.

The individual has now gained control of his mind and holds the balance of power between the organs of generation and the brain. The Spirit is now the ruler of his lower self and is able to direct all of its activities into fields of endeavor that will produce true spiritual growth. The spiritual center in the thyroid gland vibrate to violet.

#### <h4 id="the-pituitary-body-world-of-life-spirit">THE PITUITARY BODY - WORLD OF LIFE SPIRIT</h4>

The pituitary body is under the rulership of Uranus. The keynote of this great planetary Spirit expresses itself on the physical plane as originality, universality, love of liberty for all, compassion, ingenuity, independence, reformation, progression, inventiveness, sudden action, intuition, clairvoyance, mysticism, and altruism.

Debased, we find these lofty expressions manifesting as eccentricity, Bohemianism, fanaticism, licentiousness, irresponsibility, spasmodic action, riotousness, perversion, impatience, and anarchy.

The clear, celestial keynote of the planetary Spirit of Uranus lilts high above that of Venus and in time awakens its corresponding keynote in the pituitary body. Then the SIXTH rose on the cross of the vital body unfolds its golden petals and comes into bloom. This heightened vibration of the pituitary lifts the consciousness of the individual into the realm of Life Spirit where all of God's children eventually become united in ONENESS with Him, and he SEES the life force of God which permeates the whole of creation uniting each with all. This is the region of pure altruism.

In the realm of Life Spirit is a record of all that has taken place since the dawn of creation, and to this great storehouse of knowledge the individual now has ready access. From it he may glean definite information relative to the evolution of our own world and also to that of all the other planets of our solar system. Here, too, he consciously contacts his own superconscious mind which reveals to him the story of all his past lives from the time when he was conceived in the great body of the Father-Mother-God down to the present day.

In this realm the individual contacts the great Lords of From who have special charge of evolution during our Earth Period and from them he learns the true meaning of dynamic spiritual energy and how it is used to create form.

The pituitary body is one of the links in the spiritual chain that connects man with the great Christ Spirit who ordinarily functions in His life spirit vehicle: heart, pituitary body, light ether, Uranus, intellectual soul, life spirit. And all of these are used by the individual in developing the Christ within which is his own life spirit. The pituitary is the primary seat of the life spirit, and the heart is the secondary seat. By seat is meant the medium through which the individual works in developing the latent potentialities of his own life spirit which is the feminine pole of his being--the imaginative, nurturing, protecting mother energy of his Spirit. The color of the life spirit is yellow; the color of Uranus is yellow; the color of light ether is yellow; and when the pituitary body is awakened, it shines with a yellow light.

The pituitary body is closely connected with the mystic path leading to Initiation.

Thus it is clearly to be seen that the arousing of the pituitary body into action is one of the most important accomplishments to be attained in the development of the feminine, love-wisdom powers of the Spirit.

#### <h4 id="the-pineal-gland-world-of-divine-spirit">THE PINEAL GLAND - WORLD OF DIVINE SPIRIT</h4>

The pineal gland is ruled by Neptune, the light bearer for the spiritual sun which is the Father. By nature this planet is occult, prophetic, and spiritual.

Intellectuality, ruled by Mercury, lifted humanity above the animal and made man man. Spirituality, ruled by Neptune, will in time raise him above the human state and make him divine.

Neptune manifesting on the physical plane results in knowledge above reason yet explainable by it, contact with superphysical entities of all degrees, spirituality, inspiration, clairvoyance, prophecy, devotion, ability to contact celestial music, ideation, will, occultism, philosophy, divinity, the initiator.

Debased, we find its abnormal expression appearing as delusion, chaotic mental conditions, morbidity, incoherence, unreliability, vagueness, scheming, spirit-obsession, intrigue, and black magic.

When the dominant, spiritual keynote of Neptune's planetary Spirit is sensed by the individual its indescribable beauty and power awaken a true knowledge of God and His purpose for creating our solar system; for at last he sees His divine will in action and knows Him as He is.

The pineal gland is the SEVENTH rose on the cross of the vital body. When its keynote is aroused into action by the vibration of the planetary Spirit of Neptune it lifts the consciousness of the individual to the World of Divine Spirit. Here he contacts those mighty Beings known as the Lords of Individuality who assisted with our involuntary work during the Moon Period, and are now working with the life spirit of man. Knowledge of other solar systems than our own is contacted by him in this high region, and something is learned of other Gods and the worlds and beings that have been created by them.

The World of Divine Spirit is the region of pure will. There the positive energy of God expresses itself as the motive power which keeps all creation in action.

The occult path of development is closely connected with the intellectual activity developed by the Moon, Mercury, the pineal gland, and Neptune. The ray of Neptune carries what the occultists know as the Father Fire, the light and life of the divine spirit, which expresses itself as will. the color of the Father Fire is blue; Neptune's light is blue; the reflecting ether correlated to the Father is translucent blue; and when the pineal gland is aroused into action its color vibrates to a beautiful dazzling blue.

The awakening of the pineal gland is of the utmost importance in developing the masculine, positive will power of the Spirit.

The awakening of the keynotes of the ductless glands is very closely associated with Initiation, and is one of the spirit's most valuable aids in its preparation to receive initiatory work.

Three great lessons have been given to man to assist him in his development. The FIRST one was presented in the form of PICTURES and IMAGES which represented the PHYSICAL POWERS to be developed by humanity in order that they might conquer the material world. The SECOND was given by Jehovah God and delivered to the people by Moses. This lesson was embodied in laws in the form of the Ten Commandments. These LAWS work directly on the DESIRE BODY and assist the individual in gaining control of it. The THIRD lesson is Initiation brought to us by the Christ Spirit, the Lord of Love. The work leading up to Initiation is done on the VITAL BODY, which is the vehicle of LOVE. The ductless glands belong to the vital body and their spiritual activity is a tremendous help in assisting the individual in his preparation for the various initiatory degrees.

To progress spiritually it is imperative that THE INDIVIDUAL GET CONTROL OF HIS MIND and this can be accomplished only through eternal vigilance. We all know that with most people the mind and the desires work in the closest relationship. But the mind should be under the control of the Spirit and assist it in directing the desires, which then become a mighty force for good. PERSISTENT CONCENTRATION is the power used by the individual in getting control of the mind. When concentrating the Spirit, has its will power focused on the mind and is directing it toward a certain ideal. The longer the Spirit can hold the mind centered, the more control the individual is getting over it, and the more readily it will follow his dictates.

When the mind is not occupied with the work of the day it should be constantly watched and directed toward things that are of spiritual value-- like the analysis of what constitutes beauty, what is real charity, what is kindness, gentleness, justice and truth? The Spirit CANNOT GET CONTROL OF THE MIND by expending JUST A LITTLE EFFORT. It is engaged in a BATTLE ROYAL with the desire body for its possession, but it is the stronger and wiser of the two, and if it will use its will power IT CAN WIN.

THE MIND is the LINK BETWEEN the SPIRIT and its VEHICLES by means of which the Spirit gets the SPIRITUAL FOOD necessary for the DEVELOPMENT of its DIVINE POTENTIALITIES; and UNTIL THE SPIRIT GETS CONTROL OF ITS MIND IT CAN MAKE NO REAL SPIRITUAL PROGRESS.

In the future the ductless glands are destined to play an important role; their development will accelerate evolution greatly, for their effect while most important physically is of far greater importance mentally and spiritually.
