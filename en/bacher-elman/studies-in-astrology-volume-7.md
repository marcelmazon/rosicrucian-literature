### <h3 id="chapter-1">Chapter I: Dramatic Art</h3>

The instinct to act is as primordial to human nature as is any other instinct. Consider the natural tendency of all people to emphasize or intensify communication-by-speech with gestures and facial expressions. This natural emphasis is that which is cultivated by intensive training in dramatic art, just as the natural beauty of the speaking voice is cultivated in the art of singing. To dramatize, means to intensify--in whatever form or through whatever medium. Consequently, dramatization is one of the archetypal attributes of all the arts--the organized expression of a specialized "point" of emotional reaction, thought, or realization. Even the playing of two or three octaves of a scale on the piano (usually not thought of as being particularly beautiful) can be dramatized by use of tonal dynamics in such ways that its mechanistic identity as a "scale" is transformed into a "point" of expressive musicality. Technical skill can, and sometimes does, serve to produce art-work that is universally designated as mediocre. Artistic mediocrity is, essentially, art produced un-inspirationally. Inspiration in whatever form--and there are many ways by which it can be experienced--is the most highly dramatized form of human experience in no other way do we experience reaction and realization with greater intensity. As Mars and Moon are "lower-octave" impregnation and receptivity, so Sun and Neptune are "upper-octave" impregnation and receptivity. The chalice of Neptune receives the down-pouring of solar power into the "soul-seed" (the little circle at the bottom of the Neptune-symbol), the symbol of spiritual or psychic impregnation which, in any form, is inspiration; and inspiration is always a designation of response to solar love-power--the sign Leo, of the Great Mandala. The Pisces of Neptune is the upper-octave of the water-trine, initiated by the cardinal Cancer, which is the triune principle of sympathetic vibrational responsiveness. Sun and Neptune are (in composite) the planetary identity of Father-Mother God-hood of humanity.

Dramatic art had its inception in ceremony; ceremony, in turn, was man's way of personalizing, by action-symbols, his spiritual realizations. Ceremony and myth are two ways of saying the same thing: exotericising, by action and story, that which represents humanity's concepts of life-principles Man's truth is "Life's truth seen in a mirror;" the mirror is the evolutionary status of the emotional consciousness of the evolving being. The art of acting is the most completely personalized of all the forms of interpretative art-using as instruments the voice of the singer and the body of the dancer. The dancer moves in specialized rhythms, the singer "speaks " in specialized tones, the actor (by movement and speech) has something of both. The great actor fuses two highly specialized talents; that of panto-mime, which is "literalized dancing," and that of line-reading, which is " literalized singing." Great acting formalizes certain esthetic principles just as great prose-writing does; the movements of the dancer and the vocal expression of the singer correspond to acting as poetry does to great prose- writing.

Keeping in mind that "to dramatize," means "to intensify," let us now consider the significance of the diameter Leo-Aquarius, fifth house signs of Aries-Libra, as the archetypal symbol of the principle of dramatic expression. This diameter is the polarization of that which is essentially symbolized by the fifth house or the Great Mandala--the individualized radiation of emotional powers. Leo, fixed fire, is the initiating sign of the fixed cross, analogous to Aries and Sagittarius of the cardinal and mutable Crosses, respectively. It is the love aspect of the archetypal I AM and because of sequence-position, it is the releasement of that which is established in the fourth house. Its keyword is I release and it is pabulum for not only the other three signs of the fixed cross but for the active expression of the Sun in the horoscope.

Generation is Scorpio-eighth-house as individualized releasement is Leo-fifth-house, polarized spiritually and by genius through Aquarius-eleventh-house. We must keep in mind that power, as the Sun Principle, serves no purpose unless, and until, it is released and radiated. All the love in the human heart, all the creative endowment, all the inspired manifestive or interpretative genius are relatively meaningless if they are not expressed, and it is through Leo-Aquarius and Sun-Uranus that we express creatively, as far as humans can be creative. It is through the love attribute of Leo that we contribute emotional vitalization to relationships and to our work. Through it we find the resource of that which is focussed complementation, is Scorpio-generation-and regeneration. Leo is the arch-symbol of natural, spontaneous joyousness, the dynamic attribute of which the passive and transitory realization is called "happiness." Only through joyousness do we truly love, truthfully manifest or interpret, and sincerely serve. Even in "blood, sweat, and tears," joyousness is an inevitable factor in the consciousness of the artist; to be "un-joy-ful" is to be un-loving and un-radiative, in the creative sense of the word. The sorrows of Leo-Sun are rooted in the lack-of opportunity or congestion-of-ability to exercise love-radiation to other people or to work. The agonies of Aquarius- Uranus are rooted in inability to meet the gravitational challenges of Moon- Saturn and in the "birth-pangs" of bi-polar manifestivity. Unindividualized human consciousness is represented by the sequence of the first four zodiacal signs--Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer. The radiativity of this octave of primitive awareness is in the sign Scorpio, fifth house sign of Moon's Cancer- -the instinct to generate forms as a releasement of desire resources. With individualization, however, the person moves in evolutionary sequence one step ahead to the Leo-Aquarius diameter and his desire-radiation is transformed into at least a primitive aspect of love-consciousness and individualized power-consciousness. Individualized power-consciousness is the first "must" in the development and fulfillment of manifestive or interpretative artistry. So, the artist of whatever kind must know that he is a power, and personal integration must be effected before that power-consciousness can be expressed. Now, to the playwright and the actor:

The playwright is a specialization of (either one or both) prose-writer and poetry-writer. However, by the specializations of his art, he is more essentially the writer of poetry than prose, even if he doesn't (and most playwrights don't) write specifically in verse. The writing of plays involves not only an instinctive at-tunement to the principle of rhythm but also to the inherent musicality of vocal values. He must, because acting is pantomime and action as well as speech, know something of the movement-values that are inherent in dance. A sense of "time-proportion" is as necessary to his work as is a sense of "space-proportion" to the painter or "tone-proportion " to the composer. Time-consciousness is what we call the consciousness of sequence of reaction and realization. "Human reactions and realizations" are what the playwright presents in esthetically organized "dramatized" form. Actually, the "doing" that is represented on the stage is the objectification of sequences of individualized reactions and realizations. On the stage or in real living, this "doing" is always an outpicturing of inner states. And the protean mentality or understanding of the playwright makes it possible for him to construct the action of his play in accordance with a deep "inner knowing" of individualized time-consciousness. The playwright may or may not seek to present a message in his work; but what he does present, either as "message"or "pure drama," is the organization of his concept of archetypes reflected through individual or composite human consciousness. Read any play worthy of being designated as dramatic art and you will find, somewhere, an "emotional point" that is the archetype of the whole play, however complex in structure it may be. The art of manifestive drama (playwrighting) is the harmonious and expressive organization of elements which are focalized, as the tree is focalized in its seed, on this emotional point.

The Great Astrological Mandala with Aries Ascendant, cardinal structure-points connected in a square, the water-signs connected in a triangle, is the symbolic picture of that which all art seeks to interpret. Here is the human family--the male and female of "parent and child," male and female in immature and mature states, and the fourfold interchange of physical, generic, and evolutionary polarity. The trine of water-signs is the principle of sympathetic vibration by which manifestors and interpreters "tune in" on archetypes to be expressed through individualized concepts in esthetic media.

The second presentation of the Great Mandala has the fixed signs at the structure-points, Leo as Ascendant, Scorpio as base. This is the mandala of all manifestive (creative) artists, radiating from their resources of creative power, polarized by the genius of Aquarius, to fulfill a karmic inspirational redemption of the group-subconscious of humanity. The position of Cancer as twelfth house sign of this mandala shows us that the radiative potential of the Leo-Ascendant is derived from a deep resource of sympathy, of which "parenthood" is the archetype. No truly great playwright does his finest and most inspired work basically impelled by a desire to make millions in money or to attain this and that of fame or applause. He does it because he can't refrain from it and live, any more than truly mature people can live (in the real sense of the word) without contributing to life. The playwright or other manifestive artist, is a spiritual parent, an "epigenitor" of his archetype. The Scorpio base of this mandala points to the psychological base of intense regenerative desire-power. No great artist of any kind is a "psychological milk-sop;" there is deep perception, profound understanding, strong sexuality, intense emotions and, consciously or unconsciously, a blazing aspiration, in all of them.

The third basic presentation of the Great Mandala has Sagittarius on the Ascendant, mutable signs at the structure-points, and Pisces as base. This is the mandate of the interpretative artist who at-tunes himself to the concept of the manifestor and makes of himself a vehicle for the embodiment of that concept). It might be called, as abstract portrait of interpretative artist, the "mandala of individualized instrumentation." The interpretative artist disciplines, develops, and organizes his abilities and faculties in order that he may qualify for inspirational exercise. There have been a number of artists in the fields of drama, dance, and music who have qualified for designation as both manifestor and interpreter. Of the interpretative artists there are two basic types:

One type is that of the archetypal personality of which there are--and have been--several noteworthy examples in the field of motion-picture acting. Representatives of this type, in silent and sound movies, are such as: Rudolph Valentino, Theda Bara, Mary Pickford (as "America's Sweetheart" of years ago), Douglas Fairbanks, senior, Mae West, Clark Gable, and others. The outstanding example of the archetypal personality in today 's movies is "Bing" Crosby--the "world's troubadour." (1951).

The second type is that of the true dramatic interpreter, the actor or actress whose personality and personal equipment is pabulum for at-tunement to the concept of the manifestor. All great dramatic artists are of this type and they, in their persons and by their influence, are among the most conspicuous "inspirators" of the human race. The Sagittarius Ascendant of the "interpreter-mandala" portrays the esoteric (or psychological) priesthood of all dramatic representation. By the power of the actor, the essence of human personality-vibrations is represented in the roles he plays; these personality-vibration patterns are condensations of life- principles expressing through the human archetype. The inspirational projection of the actor fused with the skill and knowledge of the playwright contributes a vitalization of humanity's awareness of its own experience and identity as a life-expression. Man ever seeks to realize the truths of his archetype and, more than does any other art, drama has the power to "ignite" points of this realization. We do not really see our (individual) selves in the performances of great actors; we see "points of the self" outpictured. Our response to the impact of a great performance of tragic drama has the effect of lifting our consciousness from the "localized pain of our personal sorrows" into a vast participation of the sorrows and suffering of evolving humanity. The actor and actress are intermediaries between our consciousness of separative self and our consciousness of identity with the self-hood of our archetype, humanity. Give a little thought to your responses to performances of great acting. Do you recall the sense of "expansion into a larger self " by stimulus to your sympathy, your courage, your faith, your love, and your inspirations?

Mention might be made here of one who, in her day, was considered by most to be greatest in the field of dramatic artistry and whose fulfillment of artistic endowment represented one of the greatest developments of theatrical art: Mme. Sarah Bernhardt. The career of this great French actress (she was a native of Paris and also of Scorpio) on the stages of the world covered a span of something like sixty years and, from a standpoint of sheer "quantity of expression," as well as of quality, it was a phenomenon of staggering proportions. She not only interpreted major roles from the classical, melodramatic, and lyric repertoires, but so great was the power of her vibration that she inspired the writing of a great number of the finest plays of her time--by such authors as Francois CoppＦ, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, and many others. This woman was truly a priestess of dramatic art, consecrated with every fiber of her being to the fulfillment of an endowment that was truly a gesture of the divine to those on this plane. Read a good biography of her life. It will recharge your consciousness with a renewed faith in the power of beauty resident in the human archetype.

In application to astrological reading, the symbolic essence of dramatic ability is Venus, Jupiter, and Neptune, the signs Pisces and Leo, and the fifth house. "Dramatic career" will involve certain favorable configurations with the Moon (as the symbol of the public) and also of the sixth and tenth houses. (The prodigious achievements of Mme. Bernhardt are shown by Sun in Scorpio in combination with a conjunction of Jupiter and Uranus; it is possible that she had both Moon and Neptune in Pisces--Twelfth House--with Aries Ascendant.

Does the astrologer act? If so, what is his theater and whose lines does he read? A factor in the ethics of astrological service demands that the consultant astrologer submerge his personal feelings, thereby avoiding an infliction of negative vibrations on his troubled client, and that clarity of at-tunement to the horoscope may be effected. In this respect, he does exactly what the actor has to do. The astrologer, in his person and vibration, must dramatize serenity, friendliness, enlightenment, encouragement, and love. This is not "hypocrisy," though the word "hypocrite" does essentially mean "one who plays a part." The hypocrite misrepresents through a falsity of nature; the astrologer represents through the truths of human nature.

The astrologer "reads the lines" of human nature as an explanation of life-principles functioning through a particular archetype. His stage is any place where he presents astrological truths for the enlightenment of the consciousness of other people, privately or publicly. The astrologer serves to dramatize the essential good of the person for whom he reads and, in this function, he proves his identity as brother-in-spirit to the dramatic artist. 

### <h3 id="chapter-2">Chapter II: Motion Pictures</h3>

The development of motion pictures as an entertainment-art has been one of the most remarkable phenomena of this age. It has brought drama, comedy, music, color, dance, travel, news, educational advancement, and a pronounced cultural influence in its best forms, into the lives of millions of people who might not, otherwise, have actually experienced these things. We are concerned in this discourse not with the technical development but with the occult significance of motion picture acting and its effect on the minds and consciousness of today's people. As in any other art, there are the pioneers who dared to blaze the trail toward a more extended cultural advancement. Then there are those workers who adapt the findings of the pioneers and develop them on a larger and more perfect scale as time goes by. Then there are those motion picture manifestors not particularly interested in or even aware of cultural advancement who "give the public what it wants" in terms of maintaining that which has been established as standards of entertainment-value. The latter group is that which most conspicuously "feeds the public's escapist-tendency;" the first two groups serve to improve, extend, and regenerate the public taste and appreciation and it is they who, for the most part, are responsible for the highest quality of artistic value to be found in this work.

Many times motion pictures have been referred to as "an escape-mechanism," a "panacea" which serves to help people forget themselves and their troubles. Such an interpretation displays a lack of understanding. The motion picture art is not essentially an escape-mechanism even if some people use it as such. A psychological approach to this "quirk" in human nature should devolve on the human factor, not on the motion-picture factor. The names of "escape-mechanisms " are legion; let us consider their essence. Astrologically speaking, the vibration of unregenerate Neptune in combination with any square or opposition aspect is a potential for escape- mechanism. The square and opposition aspects are points of inner division, congestion of potentials, tendencies to disintegration, points of ignorance, confusion of identities, lack of self-awareness, lack of self-confidence, inhibitions through fear-hatred, etc. The unregeneracy of Neptune is, among other things, our potential to give power to illusions. And, we all do that, in some form or other, until the consciousness is flooded with the light of understanding and clarified perception as the result of learning through disillusionment. When we suffer from any of these negative conditions and we don't know why we suffer, we tend to identify inner truths with something, or someone, outside of ourselves. This is what is, essentially, meant by "escape-mechanism"--the attempt to escape from the pain of inner congestions and confusions.

If humanity can be said to be motivated by one common objective, that objective is certainly the realization of ideals. The ideal is a music that, once heard, cannot be resisted. The search to realize this ideality is the great evolutionary surge; we have followed this "music," consciously or unconsciously, ever since we first manifested. The realization of ideality is the fulfillment, through regenerated expression, of potentials. Until we fulfill our own as individuals, we tend to be driven to seek its outpicturing in someone or something else. Evolution is dependent on expression; to "not express" or to "not do" is to "not evolve." Even a person who lives in terms of what we call "criminality" is evolving because he is expressing his potentials; he sets up causes which will react as karmic-return from which he may, ultimately, learn more about principles. The possession of money is many people's symbol of life's greatest good and they stop at nothing to realize this ideal; however, in time, and through experience, they learn what money really is and then they are conditioned to adjust their consciousness and actions according to a clarification of principle in their own minds. Gibran said: "Even faltering speech strengthens a weak tongue; " to cease searching for the ideal is to die, in consciousness; to continue to express, as a means of searching for that which is most valued and cherished, is to evolve.

Our emotional reaction to another person identifies him as a symbol to us. If the reaction is one of envy, jealousy, hatred, fear, etc., he has served to stimulate one of our inner congestions, confusions or unfulfillments; the person we "hate" (wish to destroy) serves, by the stimulus of his vibration, to remind us of a past very serious, as yet unadjusted wrong. We do not ever "hate" another person; we can hate only our unfulfillments and we can destroy them only by regenerated expression. If our reaction to another is one of harmony, joy, love, admiration, inspiration, etc., then, whoever, or whatever he maybe, his vibration has served to remind us of our own inner regeneracies. This explains why people faith-fully and deeply love those who may mistreat and hurt them; the magnetic tie of karma provides the loving one with "pabulum" on which to pour his love. We love the ideal that another person represents to us and that "personalized ideal" is always a pattern of our own deep "dream of perfection." The financially successful older criminal may be an "ideal" to the younger, inexperienced one who has determined to exercise himself in what we call " criminal ways." Yet, in his anti-social, destructive, and unprincipled actions he still expresses in his deep urge to emulate the symbol of the older man. In justice to those who are ignorant and unevolved, let us remember that the person we designate as "criminal" may express a deep devotion to those he works for or with and within his particular limitations of consciousness, he may deal honorably with those of his "profession," and he may utilize much of his "ill-gotten gain" to be truly helpful. No one is entirely a criminal because everyone is seeking to realize an ideal. The parasitic "do nothing" is a worse traducer of his own nature than the active criminal is of his. A thief or what not at least can possess a modicum of courage. The "do nothing" hasn't even that and he is, by his very nature, non-contributory. He will have to make intensified effort in future to compensate for his deficiencies in the present.

So, the person whose potentialities are not being satisfactorily expressed or who has conditioned himself out of line with his inner ideal may, and often does, turn to motion pictures and the players who work in them, to attain a living, if artificial, contact with his personal ideals. It is not the purpose of this discourse to criticize or judge the work of specific players except as an evaluation pertaining to this subject; but certain players will be mentioned because of the remarkable archetypal quality of personality and physical appearance, plus a certain level of technical skill, by which they exercise the power of living symbolism on the subconscious of individuals or groups. Of the many who have exercised a long- lasting influence over the public subconscious we will consider four men, of contrasting type, whose work in American motion pictures represents outstanding examples of symbolic archetypal personality: Lon Chaney, Bing Crosby, Rudolph Valentino, and Clark Gable.

Mr. Chaney, whose work in silent pictures ranked him as the greatest make-up artist and one of the greatest pantomimists in the American theater, fulfilled, as an archetype, the universal, instinctive impulse of humanity to desire to transcend the hum-drum monotony of "everyday experience." His characterizations were, almost without exception, of deformed bodies and twisted personalities. He gave to audiences a satisfaction of their subconscious attraction to the weird and the horrible. His characterizations resulted in great emotional impact, he had great projective powers and the best of his performances, such as Quasimodo in Hunchback of Notre Dame, were unforgettable dramatic experiences. He epitomized the "quirks of Fate" by which humanity suffers through physical malformation and terrible frustrations of normal, natural urges. In short, his occult purpose was to bring to movie-audiences an awareness of the tragic in dramatic art. He was not an "entertainer" at all, either in purpose or in type of characterization. To have responded truly and whole-heartedly to Mr. Chaney 's remarkable work meant an intensified awareness of the pathos of human suffering. His occult purpose was aimed directly at stimulating compassion in the human heart.

The author has long felt that the work of Mr. Bing Crosby on the screen is one of the most remarkable spiritual influences in the world. (1951). With much in present-day organized religion in a state of unrest and mutation, the vibration and talent of this man serves to bring, through song and light comedy, a "gently expressed" but powerfully far- reaching stimulus to humanity's ideal of simple goodness and natural friendliness. His vibration, from an astrological standpoint, is strongly Venusian--having Libra as Ascendant, Sun in Taurus, and Moon trine Mercury and Venus. And who personifies more perfectly the ideal of constructive non-resistance? To exercise a (possibly) fanciful analogy, he might be called the "twentieth century 's St. Francis of Assisi," so compelling is the goodness and sincerity of the archetype he represents. Words are written and actions planned but he, in himself, has the specialization of consciousness that projects this archetypal quality. Others act and sing, they are enjoyable and command the respect of the public, but there is only one BING CROSBY, the "world's troubadour" and, archetypally, the friend of all whom he contacts. Who would not love to possess the friendship power that he symbolizes? He melts the hardest hearts and, with his complete lack of tension--his are the most effortless of performances--he symbolizes the un-congested personality, expressive, kindly, persuasive rather than forceful, with a perception of the good that is inherent in all. If people who flock to his pictures would recognize that they, as individuals, need only to emulate this archetype and decrystallize residues of malice, envy, jealousy, hurtful impulses, etc., they would not only enjoy his performances even more but they would be taking his example to heart. Mr. Crosby personifies truths of the regenerated human nature--his work is a series of sermons-through-acting-and-singing. People the world over love him because he outpictures their own inner best potentials of heart and spirit. Do you regard Mr. Crosby--on the screen--as an "imagination-figment" completely remote from you and your life, or do you recognize that he holds up a mirror that reflects aspects of your own innate gentleness, friendliness and harmony? Think this over carefully.

Mr. Valentino, a Latin-European of extraordinarily fine appearance, personified in his time a romantic ideal which superseded in power that of any other actor of his type. Psychology could say much concerning the hold that this man exercised over the subconscious of American women. It is true, un-pleasant as it may be to say so, that the miasma of puritanism has been an influence of blight on the minds and hearts of people for many years, and this influence has deflected people--millions of them-- from realizing the ideal of spontaneous fulfillment of love-relationship. The archetype represented by Mr. Valentino was the complete antithesis of this false, materialistic, corruptive, and subnormalizing "philosophy." The composite factors of ardent Latin temperament, plus handsome face and physique, plus a great skill in projecting the intensities of sexual magnetism, made it possible for this actor to effect a focused archetype of masculine personality which outpictured, to the feminine subconscious, an ideal of love-complementation. Under the spell of his vibration, women re- found their basic, instinctive womanhood--the desire to be conquered, over- whelmed, and transfigured by the projective power of the skillful, cultivated male. Nothing in this man's vibration and personality was at all "American;" he represented a personality-type of masculine graciousness, courtliness, amatory skill, and the cultivated charm of an older civilization. There may or may not be others on the screen today who compare favorably with this man's particular vibration and ability, but he was, in his time, archetypal of that which many if not most, women seek as an ideal love-partner. No one suggests that any man pattern his life after that of Mr. Valentino, but what he symbolized could be thought about and learned from by many men who have permitted their concepts of man-woman relationship to be congested through gracelessness, ignorance, puritanism--with its guilt complexes and lack of perception of that which is true beauty in woman. In his screen- representations, Mr. Valentino paid homage to the ideal of feminine beauty. In personal vanity, many women seek to compel the homage of men by tricks and artifices but man pays homage, ultimately, to his ideals, never to masks and bricks. There is a lesson to be learned, by men, in consideration of the work of this actor. For man to perceive, and to ignite by perception, the true beauty of woman so that woman might become and be the beauty that inspires, was the occult purpose of this actor's work on the screen.

Mr. Gable, a personification of the Mars-Saturn- Mercury type, is probably the greatest American counterpart of that which, Mr. Valentino represented as a European. He has been designated, and with justice, the greatest archetype of masculine personality on the screen today. He is all men to all people --- his Moon in Cancer designates his occult faculty to "feed the collective subconscious," and his work is attended as enthusiastically by men as it is by women. It is easy to think of him, in his screen-portrayals, as fulfilling a form of "priesthood" in so far as a priest in ceremonial religion is a personification of life-principles. Far fetched as it might at first seem, the occult significance of this actor's work is profoundly religious because he ignites in the subconscious of people an intensified perception of masculine principles of personality.

Students may not see any connection between the words "religious" or "spiritual and Mr. Gable's tough, hard-hitting, usually unsubtle, and earthy characterizations; but his person and vibration convey a symbol of resourcefulness, endurance, self-reliance, physical strength, genial good humor, and, above all, the quality of courage, which is the archetypal regenerate quality of the Mars-vibration. (He has Mars in the Ascendant-sign, making four major aspects, disposited by the ruler of the chart and trine both Jupiter and Saturn.) People, at times, tend to "sicken inside" with their own futilities, incompetencies, and weaknesses and those of others around them. Mr. Gable presents to their attention the actuality of patterns of great strength of body, mind, and character. His vibration certainly ignites an ideality-pattern since courage, self-reliance, endurance, and physical power are Mars-archetypes, and as such they represent qualities which we are all seeking to realize in ourselves. The trinity of Moon, Mars, and Saturn is the planetary base of each evolutionary cycle; Moon-Saturn, as rulers of the structure-diameter of Cancer-Capricorn, represents the parental source of the "I Am" of Mars as well as its fulfillment in maturity. A strong, well- integrated maturity presupposes a well-integrated Mars and the strongly individualized dynamic qualities of the Mars-archetype which Mr. Gable symbolizes is a vibratory essence which we all, men or women, have as a potential to be fulfilled and expressed. The universal appeal of his characterizations is pictured in the composite of two distinct patterns in his chart: Cancer-Moon and Capricorn-Saturn, with Sun and ruler in Aquarius sextile to Uranus; the twelfth house placement of his Ascendant-Mars gives us a key to the occult significance of his vibration as an archetypal personality-symbol.

If you are one who has felt "compelled" to "find yourself through motion-picture representations " and you wish to free yourself from this symbolic imprisonment, make a copy of your chart with no degree-numbers; this is what the author calls your "White-Light" chart--it is the symbolic portrait of yourself as an archetype. Study it with an eye to determining what your vibratory focal-points are (forget square and opposition in this study) and start doing something to organize your life so that you can give fuller and freer expression to your essential vibratory potentials. Study the work of the actor and/or actress whose work on the screen "fascinates" you and recognize that something in their personality or vibration is in you too. It is your right and duty to find the truth of you as an individualized expression of the archetype humanity. When you commence this reorganization, you will find yourself gradually freed from the compulsion to identify yourself through another--and your enjoyment of theatrical art and entertainment will take on a greater sincerity because you will be more and more able to enjoy it and appreciate it for its own sake. The art of living is to find out who and what we realize of ourselves. 

### <h3 id="chapter-3">Chapter III: Healing</h3>

The art of healing is an impersonalized extension of bi-polar parental love. The preservation of the begotten body is one of the factors involved in parental responsibility; wisdom, which is knowledge distilled from experience through incarnations, is added to the basic love- urge of parenthood to form the essence of the arts of healing by which humanity, in service, preserves and protects the composite of its myriads of bodies. We will consider a basic mandala indicative of this extension:

First, a circle with the vertical diameter, the signs of Cancer and Capricorn at the lower and upper points, respectively. This is the essential mandala of parentage--the maternal and paternal of the abstract I AM of the Ascendant. In primitive states, humanity functioned instinctively in parenthood, following the call of the generative urge as a fulfillment of an intensely expressed desire-with, perhaps, the barest modicum of what might be called "affection." With the conception, bearing, and hit- and-miss preservation of children, primitive mankind fulfilled the form- begetting responsibility. However, with evolution and the unfoldment of the love-potential, parents developed a consideration of children as individuals, and with this consideration was born a desire to understand them. The healing arts may be said to have been born with the first human who exercised his thought and ingenuity, as an expression of an instinctive parental protectiveness, to preserve the life of another. This hypothetical person, whoever he or she was, projected from the love-wisdom potential an imposition of mind and will on the phenomena of Nature to fulfill the dawning of the impersonalized love-service urge. Man ever urges toward extensions of blood- relationship in the unfoldments of his potentials. First, his parents, brothers and sisters, mate and children; then members of the clan or tribe to which he belongs; then members of another clan and so on--until he reaches an octave of consciousness in which he perceives a glimmering of his life- relationship with all people. He "took care" of his animals, first, because he was dependent on them for work and food; however, with the "glimmer of life-relationship" he perceived that he is related to his animals as well as to his human relatives and other humans and, as consequence, he has extended his knowledge of healing to benefit not only people but all animal-life as well. The universalist is decrystallized to such a degree that whatever he has of love-service potential is radiated to all creatures who need it.

To the mandala at hand, now add the Pisces-Virgo diameter; comparable points on Cancer-Pisces and Capricorn-Virgo are connected by curved, counter-clockwise lines. In this way we see a composite motion- picture of the Cancer-Capricorn diameter turned nine signs, coming to rest at the signs which represent the wisdom-octave of parentage. "Wisdom born of evolutionary experience" is the archetypal meaning of any ninth house-sign pattern. A devoted but unenlightened parent may make every effort to heal a loved child, but wisdom results in the art of doing anything according to its essential principles. So, the medical specialists, diagnosticians, surgeons, nurses, dentists, gynecologists, dietitians, herbalists, veterinarians, psychiatrists, etc., comprise the great fraternity of therapeutists, the "impersonal fathers and mothers" who consecrate their efforts to the maintenance of inner and outer health of all creatures. Of this fraternity, there are two basic types which we will study by mandalas. The mandala of the exoteric healer is the Virgo-Pisces diameter polarized by Gemini, ruled by Mercury, and third house sign from Aries. Gemini is factual knowledge, it is understanding derived from observation of physical phenomena and the study of recorded facts and data. The exoteric approach to the therapeutic arts is based on an approach that the body itself is the source of its own ills and, as such, it was the means by which man was impelled to acquaint himself with the structure and functions of his physical vehicle. In his early stages of evolution, he knew only what he saw, or perceived by physical means; his consciousness and appreciation of life focused on his reaction to the objective world around him. So, he studied his body by observing what happened to it under certain conditions and experiences. He learned the different kinds of pain-reaction he was capable of when his body was affected in specialized ways by external forces or agencies. This "healing-mandala," polarized by Gemini, being essentially objective, is the mandala of all diagnostic art that pertains to any branch of healing, inner and outer. It also refers to the arts of surgery and medical treatment which apply directly to the physical condition.

Man began to learn about external effects fairly early in evolutionary stages, but it was not for a long time until he came into an awareness of the significance of inner states to affect his physical well-being. The (hypothetical) first human who realized that an emotional or mental state had a direct bearing on the condition of his body, as the cause of an abnormality, was the first esoteric therapeutist. He was the first to recognize the co-existence of subjective life with objective life. His observations were the genesis of those which were subsequently evolved pertaining to the subjective cause of all physical abnormality or in-harmony-- injury as well as disease. In short, these observations refer to the karmic causation of physical disharmonies. (Winged Pharaoh, by Joan Grant, tells how the great healer-priests of ancient Egypt perceived, by clairvoyant examination, the inner causes of physical inharmonies.) The immortal Paracelsus may be referred to as an "epitome" (in relatively recent history) of this "first esoteric therapeutist." To the mandala at hand we now add the symbol for Sagittarius, polarizing Gemini, thus forming the mutable cross of instrumentation, the extension of the mandala of the exoteric healer, the portrait of man as an instrument for his own healing. The principal congestion involved is the congestion in ignorance, the "blindness to principle" which is ultimately the causation of all disease and physical injury. The initiating point of this cross is the fire sign Sagittarius-- corresponding to the Aries of the Cardinal Cross. The identity is: "I am a healer."

Now, for clarity, "build" the Sagittarius-mandala as follows: the left horizontal, Sagittarius; the upward vertical, Virgo; the right horizontal, Gemini; the downward vertical, Pisces. The healing, preservative radiation of Sagittarius is polarized by the knowledge of Gemini; the parentage-diameter is the abstract service-diameter of Virgo-Pisces. The primitive maternal instinct of Cancer is here shown to be the universal maternity of the compassionate Pisces; the primitive paternal instinct of Capricorn, exaltation of the male principle, Mars, is here shown as the stewardship of the earth-element through Virgo, as wisdom expressing through love-service. Now add the fifth and ninth cusps and the appropriate signs Aries and Leo, respectively; connect the three fire-points by straight lines forming the trine of dynamic individualization that characterizes all great esoteric healers; each one of these, by the very nature of his purpose and responsibility-fulfillment, is a fore-runner in so far as each adds a point of understanding that serves to transcend the limitations of purely exoteric knowledge. Every healer, no matter what branch of the art he serves, who applies an inspired awareness of the inner causes of injury and disease is an esoteric healer; only those who focus on the body only are to be considered "pure exotericists" of the healing-arts.

The love-potential (fifth cusp) of this mandala focusses the arch-regeneracy of courage and all esoteric healers must, to fulfill, express this virtue. The majority of humanity are, and always have been,"esoterically minded"--congested on outer appearances and blind to inner realities. To tear aside the veil of ignorance so that mankind might be alerted to "himself as the cause of his own disharmonies" has required a dauntless courage and a blazing zeal on the part of great healers. The instinctive "fear-of-the-unknown" which characterizes ignorance has always been the greatest challenge to the personal integrity of healers and this challenge has had to be met by exercise of the utmost dynamic urge represented by Mars' Aries. Leo, at the ninth cusp of this mandala focusses the "power and authority" vibration of the Sun at the house which refers to understanding and teaching. Who, in the healing arts, would presume or dare to present speculations as truths regarding subjective healing--that is, without the authority of true understanding of principles involved? In this factor of the mandala, we see the "king-ship of true understanding," the "nobility of illumined perceptions." The truths of the outer, important and significant as they are to the development of the healing arts, are mirrored reflections of the truths of the inner. Ninth house Leo is the "wisdom that radiates love" and the expression of realized truths of the inner is the essence of healing on any plane; this wisdom is a vitalizing contribution to human experiences in any aspect.

As Cancer is the symbol of that which, in consciousness, impels the woman to sacrifice her body-substance for the incarnation of Egos, so is Pisces, as the fourth house sign of the "healer- mandala," the spiritual sacrifice which is made by all true healers. The "substance" of this sacrifice is the ideality of all healers, male or female, which is offered continually in order that the ideal of health may be manifested in human experience. As the primitive woman instinctively loves her offspring, so does the feminine polarity in all human beings love that which is young, helpless, and unformed. And--"unformed" means "ignorant." The sacrifice, through ideality, which is offered by healers is often infinitely worse in degree than any physical suffering could be. To have a vision of a radiantly healthy humanity traduced continually by the congested and dark forces of materialism, prejudice, stupidity, and envy is a crucifixion of the spirit that can be--and has been--abysmal in degree. The maternal heart of all healers endures these lacerations in service just as, in another degree, the woman endures the pain of gestation and parturition. So the picture is shown to all who would be healers: be willing to neutralize the forces of congestion by a continual outpouring of your identity and of your sympathetic impulses. In this universalizing service, everything in your nature which is, or has been, "Mother" reaches into extended octaves of consciousness in order that all may benefit from the outpouring of your compassionate and sympathetic impulses.

If the urge to heal is derived from the feminine, maternal essence, then the actual work of healing is derived from the paternal essence as an extended universalization of the principle of stewardship inherent in the earth-trine, initiated by Saturn's Capricorn but focalized in this mandala as Mercury 's Virgo, the "male placement" of this mental planet. All the sympathy in the world may be, from a vibratory standpoint, an agency of healing, but so complex is the total of healing-arts and so varied are the factors they deal with that, in evolutionary processes, application of much study and observation is entailed. The polarization of Sagittarius by Gemini and of Pisces by Virgo shows us that factual knowledge of all planes of existence, in human terms, represents the completion or the fulfillment (complementation) of the basic urge or instinct by which a human seeks to make himself an instrument for healing powers. All the study and learning-from- experience ultimately serves the purpose of alerting the consciousness of the healer to a perception of health as being a universal attribute. An intelligent human father does not conceive his responsibility to comprise a "doing everything for the child;" he knows that his responsibility is to guide and alert the child to his exercise of individual potentials. So the healer, as a "universalized father," studies disease and injury for the purpose of alerting the patient (his "child") to an awareness of the patient's own responsibility in the matter. The "father-heart" of the healer says: "My child, you must learn why you have this condition and exercise yourself according to a clearer understanding of the principles of your body."

The healer, an evolving human-being with problems like anyone else, can, and sometimes does, congest and cause himself to "back- slide" in the fulfillment of his universal service. He is, like anyone else, an aspect of the Great Mandala which gives clues as to certain specialized dangers if the healer operates from a basis of congestions-in-consciousness.

The sign Cancer symbolizes not only "home and private life" but it is archetypal of the consciousness of adherence to particular race, nationality, or religion. These factors are all part of our "nest-consciousness" and serve as "evolutionary moldings." The healer who "congests on Cancer" is one who will exert himself to the utmost to help one "of his own kind" but may refuse his aid to one who is, in relationship to him, "outside the pale." Regardless of skill or ability, such an action displays ignorance of the principles of the healing arts. The sign Capricorn, focalized by Saturn, is orthodoxy, organization, and conventional standards. It is through the Saturn-vibration, in certain patterns, that the healer's individuality is challenged by "that which has been established as professional standards and ethics." All great healers are great because of their individuality and the courage of their inspired convictions. The greed for money, applause, and "reputation " which characterizes crystallized healers is a composite force which often challenges the integrity of the individual. If he transcends that challenge, his Light continues to burn brightly and purely; if he succumbs to any factor of it, his Light, sooner or later, dims and splutters. The healer cannot "sell his Light down the river" in acquiescence to that which his crystallized and unprincipled and hope to keep that Light clear and illuminative. The complementation of Sagittarius by Gemini, unregenerate, is congestion on intellectual attainment at the expense of the spiritual impulse. If a healer has reacted to disappointments and difficulties with an accretion of cynicism and gradually intensified un- sympathy, he may be tempted to find a consolation in turning "to books and away from people." A healer exists, as such, because of the needs of other living things not because of what is in books. Knowledge should be "married" to the spiritual ideal to complete, as fully as possible, the love-service which is the healer 's reason-for-being.

Any astrological student who wishes to inaugurate a period of study pertaining to the charts of healers or to astrological factors pertaining to "healing abilities" should prepare his mind for this study by first reading biographies of great healers as an "at-tunement" to the spirit in human-nature which makes people healers. He should acquaint himself, "Mercury-ishly," with the significant steps in the development of the healing arts through humanity's evolution. This is comparable, on the intellectual plane, of "meditation on mandalas" since the mind is thereby sensitized to the vibration of healers. Suggest also a reading of Franz Werfel's exquisite Song of Bernadette as a "must" for all students who wish to sensitize their awareness of the instrumentation of all great healers and the occult agencies by which great healing-centers are established. Theosophical and Rosicrucian literature is, of course, a fathomless well of knowledge concerning healing-subjects.

A few general observations: the surgical arts are characterized by the Mars-vibration; those of medicinal treatment and diagnosis, by Mercury. The Moon and Venus are conspicuous in the patterns referring to feminine specializations; Saturn for the chiropractic and orthopedic arts. A person endowed with healing vibratory power will have, usually, a strongly aspected and clear Sun, with an emphasis on the fixed signs, particularly Scorpio and Leo. The signs Pisces and Cancer and the planet Jupiter are "basic" in healing-charts. If the healer is a true one, he is a preserver--and Jupiter is the principle of preservation and improvement. The twelfth house--that of karmic responsibility-fulfillment to those limited- -must be configurated in the charts of those who serve through hospitals or other healing-institutions. Venus may or may not be conspicuous in such charts but the Moon must be--since it is the symbol of instinctive maternal sympathy and also of the public need. A form of inspirational healing can take place in the consciousness of anyone who studies the subject of healing-- and the astrologer, "twin-brother" to the esoteric healer, must radiate healing by his friendliness, perceptions, and impersonalized love. He functions as a "healer of the psyche" by his alertment of the consciousness of humanity to the truths of life-principles. 

### <h3 id="chapter-4">Chapter IV: Fraternity of Astrologer, Artist, Priest, and Healer</h3>

"Relationship" may be defined as "the meaning, purpose, and significance of a thing with reference to the synchronization of its consciousness with that of another thing to which it is attracted by the laws of sympathetic vibration;" these laws are all inherent in the Law of Cause and Effect and the principles of creativity and epigenesis.

There are only two basic relationship-patterns, each of which is manifested through diffusion in innumerable octaves throughout the Cosmos. The first of these is the creative relationship--that of macrocosm and microcosm to each other. The first aspect of this relationship is that of The Unknowable to (what might be called) the Logoi of arch-galaxies. The composite of arch-galaxies, at any given point in time, is the total manifested Cosmos; each arch-galaxy is a "structure-point" of the Cosmic Body. The second aspect (or octave) of this relationship is that of the Logos of each arch-galaxy to the Logoi of its galaxies; the third is the relationship of galactic Logoi to the Logoi of its solar-systems; the fourth is that of the relationship of each Solar Logos in a galaxy to the planetary Logoi of its system. From here on down into diffusion of manifestation, creativity becomes epigenesis. To Sum up: macrocosmic identity (from unity to solar logoic) is to macro-cosmic identity (subsolar-logoi) as creativity (life function) is to epigenesis. In human terms, since humans are not creators but epigenitors, the most transcendent octave of this relationship-pattern is that of the universal regenerator to the collective superconscious, conscious, and subconscious of the archetype, Humanity; the densest octave is that of the biological relationship (sexual epigenesis) of parent and child to each other.

The second relationship-pattern is that of fraternity and it may be defined as: "The relationship of macrocosms to each other and microcosms to each other by parallelity of creative or epigenetic faculty:" also, since every manifestation is "micro-cosm" relative to The Unknowable, fraternity is the relationship of things to each other by magnetic attraction through synchronization of similarities and dissimilarities of vibratory states. The minimum scope of fraternity is one thing in relationship to one other thing; in all fraternal relationships, the two things concerned have at least one point of mutual similarity and one point of dissimilarity. The point of mutual dissimilarity makes possible the epigenetic action in the life of the relationship. Creative action is radiation from a self-willed fusion of polarity-powers; epigenetic action is radiation of polarity-potentials from response to stimulus of power from a higher octave. Think about this. A human relatively unevolved on a particular point of consciousness is epigenetically stimulated by vibrational contact with another who is relatively evolved on that point. The point-in- common is the point-in-consciousness or point-of-faculty which each is seeking to fulfill; they walk hand in hand in that particular fulfillment-aspiration. The "point of dissimilarity" is the contrast of the one's relative fulfillment and the other's relative unfulfillment. The former radiates to the latter; the latter absorbs from the former. Hence each, because the relatively mature must out-give and the relatively immature must in-take, serves to provide on- going for the other.

The Unknowable does not have fraternity with any other thing; It is The One, the All-that-is. But, what might be called the "essential energy" is the biune essence, polarity. In polarity is seen the arch-macrocosmic octave of fraternity; its biunity (two-ness-in- unity) is manifested as ( l ) Will: positive, projective, impregnative, masculine, male, and (2) Imagination: negative, magnetic, receptive, reactive, feminine, female. The inter-action of this biunity makes possible every creative and epigenetic function on all octaves and cycles throughout all specified identities. Much thought can be given to the significance of the number two. It is not really "two ones;" it is actually the outpicturing of the polarity-potentials of one. If polarity is the biune "essential energy" of the Cosmos (the inner life of unity), then two is the arch-symbol of diffusion of polarity-potentials. "Humanity" is an aspect of unity because it is an archetype; the two-ness of this archetype is the "diffusion" we call mom and woman. Sex (male and female) is the physical representation of biunity; gender (masculine and feminine) is the biune diffusion of vibrational being. Each male and each female contains (or possesses) the biune attribute of gender; the masculine of this attribute is expressiveness, the feminine is reactiveness. These two words, in turn, composite what might be called the "attribute of being capable of experience" and experience is, humanly speaking, epigenesis--the evolutionary unfoldment of potentials. The four words (two twos) male, female, masculine, and feminine are the structure points of our epigenetic being; by our consciousness of them we identify ourselves and others as factors in the archetypal human family, and by them is manifested our individualized consciousness; of every possible human relationship-pattern, as long as we pertain to the archetype "humanity." The perfect fulfillment of consciousness through experience as relationship- factors is the purpose of our evolution.

In the absolute sense, every manifestation in Cosmos has fraternity with every other and all others since all are "children of The Unknowable." Should we choose to make the effort, we humans could possibly touch a feeling of fraternity with the inhabitants of planets of other solar systems as well as those of our own system. We can, however, by analogy perceive intellectually the fraternity of higher octaves of Life in consideration of the inter-fraternity of creative sources in descending order to that identity we call "Solar logos." This represents the exoteric aspect of the archetypal fraternal relationship--the parellelity by identity through similarity of creative attribute. In descending order we will name the fraternities of arch-galactic Logoi, galactic Logoi, Solar Logoi, Planetary Rulers, Satellite Rulers, and, in Earth-terms, the members of each specific life-wave, each archetype, each species of each archetype. The fraternity, for example, of mammalia includes all humans, cats, whales, rodents, etc., but each of these species is, in itself, a fraternity. There are also the two fraternities, in every archetype, of males and females. This esoteric aspect of fraternity refers to form, identity, structure-pattern, instinct-pattern, and creative or epigenetic potential. It is the"who and what" of fraternity manifested. Elasticize your mind a bit to consider this " fraternal grouping" of Life-forms.

The esoteric aspect of fraternity has to do with inter-relationship by parallelity of evolutionary development relative to the creative source--in our case our Solar Logos. We, as inhabitants of Earth, are fraternal to the inhabitants of all planets of our system--we all derive from the same creative source. In a more condensed sense, we (as the highest epigenetic development on this planet) have a closer fraternity with the highest development on each of the other planets of our system. Further subjective condensation: we, on this planet, are most closely fraternal to all others whose ideality-fulfillments and ideality-unfulfillments are similar (parallel) to ours. This fraternity transcends in significance all others which refer to sex, race, nationality, etc. It is the fraternity of consciousness-octaves and all members of soul-fraternities are magnetized to each other through the attraction of their similarities plus dis-similarities for epigenetic development. All musicians, for example, from most primitive to most cultivated, are fraternal to each other because all who belong to this fraternity have, in common, a similarity of esthetic expression--regardless of the range of differences in their scope. The arch-fraternity of workers has its biune diffusion in employer and employee, but all members of both classifications (generally or specifically) are parallel to each other in the kind of service which they render to the ongoing of human life. This fraternity, unevolved, is congested, in the concept of "money is the reason for working;" evolved, the realization is attained that"money is an outer evaluation and an expression of inter-exchange between people--and that love- service is the ideal to be realized." In each factor of human experience, a principle unites people in groupings by inter-relationship--the principle of the "inner"of the work-activity; the outer action is the means by which principle-realization is evolved. Each life-principle overshadows (as does the Grand-Master of a lodge or spiritual organization) every human fraternity in and through which realization of truth is distilled.

In thus considering the nature of fraternity, we are clearly alerted to the fact that what we call "entity" is a designation of our feeling about some-one; it is not, nor can it ever be, a designation of specific identity. Entity-feelings are congestions of love-consciousness, congestions of epigenetic powers, etc., which we feel when our unfulfillments are stimulated by another's vibration. No part of a human horoscope represents a delineation of "enemies, open or secret" because no human being is an "enemy" to any other. Those parts of the horoscope that we have been taught to delineate in this (philosophically false) way are those which, when stimulated by similar points in another's chart cause us to become aware of our feelings of guilt, frustration, and insecurity. Until we become aware of our parallelity with the person we identify these feelings by such words as hate, fear, detestation, disgust, etc. We say that we hate, fear, detest the person. That is not really true; we hate our ignorance, our congestions, and our false ideals; we do not hate people. The moment we become aware of the truth that something in that person parallels something in us we begin to glimpse our fraternity (togetherness) with him; something in our consciousness that wants (aspires) to decrystallize and evolve immediately goes to work at that point to make us aware of our regenerate parallelity with that person. An example of life 's mercy, no less. In the opinion of the author, stated in a previous article, the intense congestions which are epitomized by the fixed sign Scorpio, ruled by Pluto, find their arch- decrystallization in the sign Gemini--because Gemini is the astrological symbol for the essence of fraternal awareness.

Keeping in mind that (symbolically speaking) straight lines are abstractions of curves, consider the fact that the symbol for this mutable air sign is the only one of the twelve made with four lines-- two horizontals and two verticals. As such, they are the abstractions of the four semi-circles initiated by the cardinal structure-points of the Great Astrological Mandala. They also picture, from another approach, the "four- foldness" of that which is inherent in the vertical and horizontal diameters of the Great Mandala. the four-fold composite of gender-sex of the archetypal human family: two-fold Begettor, two-fold Begotten--male and female both as expressers and as reactors. It pictures the essence of parallelity of parents with children in the sense that all parents have been children, children have the epigenetic potential of becoming parents, or "life-givers." Thus it pictures the parallelity of all manifestations because all erectors have been epigenitors and all epigenitors have the potentials for becoming creators. The creator is "elder brother" to the epigenitor; the epigenitor is "younger brother" to the creator. That which is closest to unity is the elder in any archetype. The fraternity of mate-hood is seen in the similarity of epigenetic power of human male and female synchronized with the complementation of dissimilarity of physical function. The fused action of two human sexual units provides the four-fold synchronization (expressive) reactive of male and female--the epigenetic fraternity of life-transmission. Husband and wife are "brother-and-sister" in the love-service of parenthood. Think about this if you feel inclined to throw all the blame for your marital unhappiness (if you have such) on your partner. Perhaps you need to remind yourself of the fraternity that is deeply and intrinsically inherent in the relationship. Those of you who may be congested on bad feeling toward a parent: remember that you and the parent are fraternal by membership in the same family-group; your similarities and dissimilarities are what magnetized you to each other for mutual fulfillment. Learn of yourself by studying and perceiving these similarities--you have no better source of instruction.

With reference to the subject at hand, the fraternity of astrologer, artist, priest, and healer comprises the fraternity of epigenetic regenerators. In relationship to the source, these are pictured as the mutable cross-- the dispersors of channelings of wisdom and regenerative power. As such they are "God's little brothers" on this plane. But, in relationship to those who are ignorant, congested, crystallized, etc., they are pictured by the fixed cross, initiated by the fire-sign Leo, a symbol of that which corresponds to our Creative Source, the "humanization of the God-head." The inspired Power-Radiators of this plane are the "kings of Earth;" though Capricorn-Cancer abstractly pictures the principle of "parentage-of-forms, Leo-Aquarius pictures the principle of "parentage-of- Spirits" because it is through this diameter that creative solar power is released through this manifestation. (It has been given in occult instruction that our solar system had its inception, or began its manifestation, when the Sun, by precession, was in the sign Leo--the sign of radiative source.) Taurus-Scorpio is the desire-aspect of creativity, it is the bi-polar symbol of our creativity as epigenitors. Leo-Aquarius, however, is the Source of epigenetic power--it is the love attribute in which, and through which, we find our Divine Center. Before sex was, love was, and the fraternity of regenerators are those who recharge the spiritual consciousness of mankind from their releasements of fused Sun-Uranus power. As such, they are our elder brothers and sisters and fraternal to our Spirits as our fathers and mothers are to our expression as bodies on this plane.

The great Regenerators of this planet may seem, and sometimes do seem, as gods to those less evolved. They know their source- of-power and they have distilled the wisdom to radiate that power according to fulfillment-principles. They possess extensions of our own attributes that make them take on a semblance of super-humanity. They make manifest our Inner Ideality of ourselves as individualizations of our archetype and we tend to "worship" them as we worship our concept of God. Their radiations of power as illumination by wisdom, love, beauty, and healing reach the innermost of our best selves--they ignite a fragment of the Self which abides eternally within each of us; in consequence, by their service we come into a perception of our inherent divinities--we experience a transfiguration of consciousness that makes us seem to be inhabitants of a heaven world. Because it is our nature to personalize our reactions and feelings we say that we love these people: we do, but what we really mean by that statement is that by response to their ignition of our consciousness we perceive more clearly than ever before that love which is God, the transcendent, transfiguring, transforming glory that is our attunement--for a little time at least--to what our lives should, in reality, be. It is a. part of our implied service, as humans, to keep alive that "magic"- and through its regenerating of our consciousness to radiate the inspiration, the joy, the healing-love to those in our immediate circles of relationship and acquaintance. We, too, can be "channelings" for the magic powers of Good, each in our own way and according to our development and aspiration.

Let us remember that (though god-like) even the highly evolved ones of this Fraternity of Regenerators are, on this plane, human. And it is just as possible that each, or any, of them can congest in some specific factor of his or her personal awareness. We must, however devoted and worshipping, free even the most deeply beloved to be themselves as individuals, to make their "human mistakes" and exercise the right to learn from the results of those mistakes. When we love to such a point that we retain heart-felt gratitude for inspirational services rendered and release the pains of disillusionment and disappointment when our "elders" reveal feet of clay, we raise and purify the quality of our vibrational response, and, in liberating them from personal congestions, we make possible their freedom to regenerate and heal themselves. The "freeing" that we extend in true loving devotion is the essence of what they have sought to teach us; regenerative evolution is the process of liberating from congestions, and whether through response to art, to religious or philosophical teaching, to healing agencies, or what-not, we experience liberation in every response to regenerative agencies, The regenerator who congests on false pride, greed for applause and acclaim, intellectual crystallization, impairing his radiative powers by using them as a substitute for a personal frustration instead of love-service, is simply reacting with something in his being that refers to the "still human" part of him. Astrologer, priest, artist, and healer can (and do) meet these points in their experience; the tendency to allow personal disappointment to throw them out of line, the temptation to congestion on self-isolation, to congest on opinionatedness and prejudice, the challenges of the material world of finance and material means, etc., are all, to members of this fraternity, critical points in experience; much depends on them--so much has to be met in order that clarity of channeling and radiative power may be maintained. The astrologer must seek always the truths of life as they are pictured in his chart; he cannot, in truth, perceive the full values of another's chart until he has signified his willingness to see his own with detachment and discernment. This is the first of his occult responsibilities; on the quality of his determination to fulfil lit as he goes on through life will depend the quality of his love-wisdom-service to others.

In conclusion, a fraternal thought to all regenerators who have chosen the path of astrological guidance: May the lotus of your soul unfold its perfections of white and gold on the serene waters of boundless and truthful sympathy; may the red rose of love and inspirational courage bloom on, and glorify, the Cross of your identities. 

### <h3 id="chapter-5">Chapter V: Planetary Joys</h3>

The polarity of our physical actions is a most fascinating study. For example: COMMUNICATION: masculine, speaking; feminine, listening; INSTRUCTION: masculine, teaching; feminine, learning; NUTRITION: masculine, mastication and swallowing; feminine, digesting and absorbing; PHYSICAL BEING: masculine, conscious action and expression; feminine, reaction and reflection. And so forth. In the first of these we display the qualities and attributes of our projective polarity, the second displays our reactive and subconscious levels of being-ness. Spiritualized consciousness has "joyousness" as the masculine polarity and "happiness" as the feminine, reactive polarity. "Happiness" is that which results, as reaction, from joyous action and expression. "Joyousness" is that quality of Spirit which impels our expressions of Love and Wisdom.

It might be stated this way: We move through experience in joyousness from happiness to happiness. Experience is, of course, the sequence of our actions and reactions throughout our incarnations. Joyousness is not dissimilar from "faculty"--it is a power of consciousness. What we call "pain" is a reaction to something established through "unjoy"--expressions of energy congested in negative desire and ignorance. "Pain" (as a quality of our reactive faculty) might be called the "gestation and birth--struggles of happiness"--it is happiness "crying out to be recognized."

In astrological symbology, the sextile aspect is the mechanism for translating the "pain-potential" into the "happiness- potential." When a human exercises his sextilic powers joyously he makes the most rapid translation of his congested energies into that which will register next time--or in a future incarnation--as the trine. The trine aspects are patternings of consciousness which register the results of previous spiritualizing exercise and they are "bank-accounts" for future-and greater-spiritual exercise. Every planet, as an "organ in the vibratory body" is a potential releasement of the joyousness-consciousness because each planet, as a "focalizer" of a zodiacal sign, is a "distributive point" for the expressions of spirit. Each planet in a given chart, must be understood in this way if the astrological reader and interpreter is to determine intuitively the spiritualization which the person's evolutionary needs require of him in this incarnation.

For mandalas to clarify this thought, draw two circles. In one place the interlacing grand trines representing the cusp- points of the fire and air signs of the Great Mandala. This design is initiated by the projective, dynamic quality of Aries in the Great Mandala or by the Ascendant-sign of the natal horoscope. This is the mandala of humanity's joyousness, as male and as female; it is the potential of every human to express, by identity as a "child of Father-Mother God," the radiations of Love and Wisdom. Any sign can be an Ascendant-sign, therefore any planet can be the vibratory focalizer of this spiritualized energy.

In the second circle, place the interlacing grand trines which are analogous to the earth and water signs. This design is the faculty of both male and female to react to spiritualized expressions from the resources of spiritualized consciousness. It is the mandala of happiness--the faculty of reacting and realizing in terms of the upper octaves of consciousness. Because the vertical (Capricorn-Cancer) is the line of parentage it is shown that what man reacts to with happiness he himself has built ("parented") by expressions of his own consciousness. "Verticality" is reproduced in the fire-air mandala in the lines Leo- Sagittarius and Aquarius-Gemini. These vertical lines "enclose" or "pattern" the twofold "radiation" from fire and air-cardinal to fire and air-fixed and mutable.

Interpreted: IDENTITY (expressive male and expressive female)--radiating Divine power as love and as wisdom. These two dynamic trines symbolize the expressive polarity of the highest octaves of the individualized human consciousness; they represent, abstractly, the "epitomes of the virtues in expression." The horizontal of the fire-air mandala is reproduced in the earth-water trines by the lines Taurus-Virgo and Scorpio- Pisces. Since the horizontal Aries-Libra, in relationship to Capricorn- Cancer, symbolizes "that which is begotten" the horizontals of the earth-water trines "pattern" the radiations to fixed and mutable from the two cardinal parentage-points. It is the horizontal of Taurus-Virgo that is the base of the symbol we use in astrology for the trine aspect. This one is the most perfectly static of the four triangles--the one which most perfectly symbolizes result.

A study of the three signs of the earth-trinity tells us that this trine is generated (initiated) by the sign Capricorn which, esoterically speaking, is the power to assume and fulfill responsibilities-- the insignia of the matured human consciousness. This initiating point is the exaltation of Mars: self-directed expression and self-initiated control of energy-powers. The radiation from Capricorn to Taurus, fixed-earth and Capricorn's fifth house-sign, "connects" or "channels" the principle and power of responsibility-fulfillment to the principle of steward-ship and equilibriated exchanges. Taurus is ruled by Venus, the principle of equilibrium, and this sign is exaltation-point of Capricorn's planetary polarity--the Moon, ruler of Cancer.

Taurus, furthermore, is eleventh house-sign of Moon's Cancer and liberation of the begotten to its individualized fulfillments is the initiation through the stewardship-principle. The second "radiation" from Capricorn is to Virgo, abstracting two-thirds of the circle represented by the arc of Capricorn to Virgo through Taurus. Virgo is earth- dignity of Mercury and is the wisdom octave (ninth house-sign) of Capricorn's responsibility-fulfillment power. This responsibility, channeled through Mercury's power, is that of putting to right use and service that which has been learned. Mercury's air-dignity is Gemini, the feminine polarity of the education-diameter (Sagittarius-Gemini) and, as such, it is the principle of Learning, the "inhalation of knowledge" and the "response to the stimulation of inner knowing." As has been said before, it is the author 's conviction that Mercury, as ruler of Virgo, is exalted in the fixed air-sign Aquarius, the love-octave of the air-trine which is initiated by the Cardinal Air-sign Libra, ruled by Venus. As such the fraternity-consciousness of the air-trine is correlated and synthesized with the earth-trine as the spiritual responsibility to fulfill human relationships through the power of love as "fraternity," the essence of joyousness in human relationship and the epitome of the human heart's highest aspirations.

In this study we are dealing with the astrology of humans while they are incarnate--"consciousness fused with the material universe." We use the horizontally-based triangle as our arch-symbol of spiritualized human consciousness because it is here on this plane that we perceive the out-picturings of our past alchemical endeavors and we have the responsibility to express them further in relationship to our fellow-humans. However, in the representation of the earth-trine is implied the fire-trine- just as Capricorn, or any other cusp-sign, is implied in the potentials of the abstract Ascendant, Aries. The fire-trine was expressed, in degree; the earth-trine is the resultant distillation in consciousness and outer conditions Capricorn, as an exaltation-sign, has inherent the powers of Mars matured by "affiliation" with the powers of Saturn.

A trine-aspect between two planets implies the condition of a grand-trine in the making. All grand-trines are "evolutionary high-water marks" because three points of an element (fire, earth, air, water) are patterned or "structuralized" as the result of previous regenerate expressions. A two-planet trine is (to analogize) the hundred-per cent mark on your examination paper in one particular subject during the school term; a grand-trine is the hundred percent mark on your term examination that qualifies you for promotion with honors. The implication is that, having distilled the grand-trine, you are qualified to express those powers, not just to "enjoy the promotion with honors." Any chart displaying a grand-trine displays spiritual pabulum to be used for regenerating the congestions in the chart. Some astrologers have said, in effect: "I don't like to see a grand-trine in a chart; the person always tries to take things too easy--he doesn't make effort." That is only because the person (represented by the chart) has not been instructed that states of development are powers that must be used. Anyone who just enjoys his grand- trine and ignores corrective measures is like a. person who graduates with high honors but does not apply that which he has learned when he enters business or professional life--he just "sails along, priding himself on the high mark." Trines and grand-trines do not imply mastery--only relative mastery in terms of the evolutionary status. The horoscope of an inhabitant of the Borneo jungles could register a trine, but it would only mean that the person possessed a superior quality in comparison with his fellow jungle- citizens. Basic principles apply regardless of outer identity, but some knowledge of outer identity does help the astrologer to interpret the evolutionary quality of trine aspects.

Planets, in relationship to each other, are either "dignified" or "disposited." If they are dignified, they are in the signs which they rule; if they are disposited, they are in signs ruled by another planet. A dignified planet that is trined (either "singly" or"grandly") tells us that the person will have, in this incarnation, a great variety of experience in those things to which the planet refers. A dignified planet is in a first house-sign placement; its "trined condition" is information that in this incarnation the person is to express dynamically a deep residue of powers distilled from many past incarnations. He has, as far as that planet is concerned, "returned to home-base after a tour of the zodiac" and he is now, by indication of the trine registration, qualified to radiate with great effect--and for great good--in terms of that planet's principles. Such a person will be provided with many objectives toward which he may "radiate" as well as many "reflective agencies" by reaction to which he may enjoy realizing the results of his past spiritualized expressions. A dignified planet that is grand-trined is one of the most important factors to study in the chart. Such a planet is an "arch-power" for regenerative adjustment for the entire wheel. A grand-trined exalted planet represents the maximum planetary expression in human astrology. Such a position is indicative of the fruitage of spiritual initiation in the past; an exalted planet having one single trine is indicative of the same but on a lesser octave.

It is, however, tremendous power which if rightly and progressively expressed, makes the person appear in the world of other humans as a personification of white light. Dignified and exalted planets (trined and grand-trined) will usually picture a remarkable amplitude in outer circumstances because those patterns and powers represent our consciousness of the infinitude of God's power and love. Therefore a certain abundance of good will be perceived in the external circumstances. Another "trine-pattern" that is deserving of much study is the placement of planets in their own fifth and ninth house-signs. Call the planet's sign of dignity "one" and in each case count around the wheel counter-clockwise (or "zodiac-wise") and see if any of your planets are so placed relative to their dignity-sign. It is felt by the author that all planets so placed, regardless of sign-placement or planetary aspects have a certain specialized spiritual significance because in the planet's "zodiacal tour" it has reached those "points" representing timings to express their principles in terms of love-power and wisdom-power. Exercise much elasticity of key-word approach in this study. It is complicated and sooner or later intuition must step in to take over where intellect cannot reach. The use of simplified mandalas is a clarifying technique which makes it possible for your intellect and intuition to focus on specific points.

Clarifying your awareness of the basic differences between the words "joyousness" and "happiness" results in an elasticization of your approach to trine-aspects that brings remarkable results. Just as birth on the physical plane marks a culmination (of the gestative process) so does it mark the initiation of the incarnation with its possibilities for growth, expression, and realization. We might speak of the joyousness of love-union (mutual expression) and the happiness experienced by the parents when their child is normally and healthily born; or the joyousness of musical practice and training and the happiness of a successful first recital. And so forth--there are many such illustrations to consider as representative of the trine aspect outpictured in terms of active and passive registration.

Thus, joyousness creates happiness. Even intensive effort, struggle, agony of mind and soul, and all such intense emotional states can be basically joyous. It is joyousness that makes it possible for us to fulfill our requirements in spite of all seeming external or internal obstacles. In joyousness we charge our expressions with the utmost of our love-power, devotion-power fidelity-power, improvement-power, harmonizing-power, esthetic-power, sympathy-power, intelligence-power, physical-power, etc. The great ones in this world, regardless of how "unhappy" their lives may seem to us, are basically joyous because the Divine Powers of Love and Wisdom are channeled through them. Their "personal elements" may register unfulfillment in many ways but TRULY GREAT people are much more than "just folks with homes, wives, husbands, and jobs." They, and what they do to express their consciousness, are gestures of the divine to this plane--the great therapeutists, artists, writers, teachers, humanitarians all testify to the invincible power of joyousness to fulfill the realization of idealities. They do not think of life in terms of "something to be enjoyed" in the easy-going way that most of us think of "enjoyment." They approach living as their opportunity to express the utmost of their highest and best-- to fulfill their specialized patternings of evolutionary law and progress.

The "unjoyous" are the apathetic, the careless, the indifferent, the mentally and emotionally slovenly; they exist in motion by response to things in themselves which, for the most part, they do not understand. The joyous ones are conscious -deeply so--of course and objective; they express their resources and fulfill their objectives with a focus of power, intelligence, and devotion that qualifies them to swing the tide of human evolution upward and onward. There are relatively few geniuses incarnate at any one time but every human can learn to live joyously in the sense that all who will to can become more clearly aware of their divine identity and of their divine resources. It is when we think of ourselves as "worms in the eyes of God" that we turn from our identity as "joyous Beings." We are, in truth, "sparks from the flame of God" and a spark has the attributes of light, warmth, and upward motion.

To recognize that any planet can be the ruler of a horoscope and that every sign has its place in the trine-symbol helps us to realize that no human is excluded from the privilege of living joyously. The old "image" that "misery is our lot" is true only when we ourselves express miserably, limitedly, fear-fully, congestively, and without recognition of divine potentials and spiritual objectives. Every action we perform, every reaction we experience, every emotional expression and every thought we hold has a particular vibratory qualification and that means that all of these things can be translated into higher octaves of joyousness in expression and happiness in reaction if we choose to make them so.

#### <h4 id="part-2">Part II</h4>

The sign Leo, ruled by the Sun as fifth house- sign of the great Mandala, will be taken, in this discourse, as the archetype of the consciousness of joyousness. When clearer realization of our solar identity and solar power is more and more revealed through alchemical functioning we recognize a greater amplitude of capacities and objectives. Our Solar Parent is the Source of ALL that we are, have, or can attain in our human functioning, and perception of our unity with this Source aligns us in consciousness, to the presence and the availability of solar abundance on all planes. A truly joyous-hearted person is so because he is aware, to a degree, of the availability of this abundance--he is relatively free from constricting fears which in most of us, minimize the quantity and quality of our expressiveness and reactiveness as we go through an incarnation. By exercise of Sun-consciousness, self-awareness,and self-direction, which are the roots of all security, are practiced; results are studied and mistakes learned by, which is the essence of all true education. Expression of Sun- consciousness is greater amplitude of out-givingness, the counter-active to the natural instinct for "intaking-ness" of the limited, insecure person. With the neutralization of these limitations and insecurities, the love- consciousness blooms like the red rose on its bush--the perception of the essential good in other humans takes the place, more and more, of prejudice, retaliation, jealousy and fear. Time is perceived to be an "ally," not a limitation, legitimate responsibilities are seen to be channelings for maturity, not heavy down-pulling burdens. All the planet-powers are derivations of Solar Power; let us consider each in turn as a channel uniquely qualified--for the expression of joyousness.

MARS--ruler of Aries: Joyousness as physical action and physical development; the joy of meeting internal and external challenges with courage; good sportsmanship by which the competitive instinct serves to stimulate for further and better efforts; the joy of childhood--the interested attitude toward "new things;" the joy of pioneering and "carving out new paths;" in higher consciousness this joy is moral courage-dynamic powers expressed through personal integration to stand for the right as it is understood by the individuals; it is that quality in the aspirant that enables him to "face the enemy in himself " and to overcome that "enemy" by regenerate living; it is the self-protective instinct translated into the "joy of protecting loved ones, a loved work or loved ideals;" it is courage as a channeling for the expression for love.

VENUS--ruler of Taurus: Joyousness as the sense of "identification with nature;" self-expression in terms of fulfilling one's physical needs by right exchanges with nature and with other people; love of earth-things, cultivation of plant-life for utility and beauty; the right use of the services of animal-life; joyousness as expression of good will in financial exchanges--to express the heart by financial means; the devotion to the principle of right stewardship on all planes so that equilibrium is maintained; joyousness as the form of expression by which our contributions to the physical aspects of human life are made in terms of esthetic values and standards.

MERCURY--ruler of Gemini: Joyousness as the exercise of an open mind in the functions of learning; the joys of communication by written and spoken words; the exchanges of thoughts and ideas by the fraternity of languages in which minds meet in mutuality and external differences are minimized; joyousness in expressing that which has been learned by study of the Law of Cause and Effect--the basis of all spiritualized education; actions based on the response to all opportunities to learn-exoterically or esoterically; the arch-octave of this vibration is the joyousness of communication--which is fraternity activated.

MOON--ruler of Cancer: Joyousness as the heart- quality which prompts us to express in terms of nurture, comfort, and protection; this joy is primitively based on self-sacrifice--the "feeding of life by the relinquishment of self;" it is the joy of mother-love and in its quality is seen the archetypal joy of giving; true giving, nurture, and protection depend on sympathetic at-tunement to truths, and the joy of superficial givingness is raised to higher and higher levels when discrimination is exercised so that the good in others is what we feel moved to nurture. Sympathy to another's true needs prompts our best expressions through this joy--we then are alerted to our utmost capacities to provide a degree of fulfillment for the required need. Sacrifice--on any level--that is made in response to compulsion may be made with remarkable completeness, but it is the voluntary, self-initiated sacrifice that is truly joyous because such an expression is based on integrity. This vibration is the essential base for all nutritive contributions to family, national, and international welfare and progress. Those who give to the race itself are often crucified for their giving, but the "possible opportunity of crucifixion " does not, to a joyous heart lessen the quality of the offered contribution.

SUN--ruler of Leo: Joyousness in the pure, unalloyed radiation of Love-power, regardless of response or return; the administration of power in terms of equity and honor; this joy is truly that of hospitality, expressing through that which was established in Cancer; it is the particular quality of joyousness that characterizes all great entertainers--whose talent expressions enable us to respond with laughter and the attendant release of tensions. Essentially, Leo is joyousness as amplitude, of any kind, in expression.

MERCURY--ruler of Virgo: Joyousness as the putting-to-use of that which has been learned; such expressions result in true service--the discriminating exercise of knowledge. Through Virgo we begin to "touch the impersonal" because it is the modulation from the lower six house- signs of the Great Mandala to the upper six. It is the joy of doing the work that one loves to do and it is also the joy of loving one's fellow-workers-- whether employers, colleagues or employees; these persons are fraternal to us in a specialized, impersonal way. Virgo is the joy of specialized physical, mental, and psychological training to equip us for the relatively perfect fulfillment of our chosen life-service and the "total enthusiasm" by which we effect that fulfillment

VENUS--ruler of Libra: the joy of expressing the consciousness of "we are"--extension, by polarity, of the individualized I AM; the joy of aspiring to include the good of others in our plans and expressions as amplification of our desires to realize our individualized good. This is the joy of love-exchange-mutual expression and mutual reflection of human ideality-perception; it is our joy to be in such ways that the beauty of the human archetype may, in degree, be perceived in us by others so that their deep dream of beauty may be relatively at least, gratified. Joyousness--as Libra--is that expression of soul-power which we call co- operation; it is one of the arch-virtues and the persons who, with amplitude and generosity, exercise the power of co-operation are those to whom joy is a life-long companion; the integrity of truly good hearts strikes a sympathetic key-note in the hearts of others with a"lifting power." As a result, the song of "we are" is sung more and more beautifully.

PLUTO--ruler of Scorpio: without love and beauty, generative exercise is a frenzied, self-centered compulsion, but as an expression of mutual love it becomes an intense, transfiguring co-operative joy; it is, as such, a dynamic expression of releasing deep resources of vibratory power toward the end that the" partnership-idealities " of each person concerned may be the more vividly realized; as love-expression, it is "Life giving life to itself"--the two persons concerned identify themselves with the procreative attribute of the Cosmos for the begetting of new life-vehicles or for the generation of deeper love-consciousness toward, and for, each other. On the subjective planes, Scorpio represents expressions from the deepest reaches of potential and consciousness--the most intense devotions and consecrations. It is the joy of the martyr, of the devotee and of the ascetic--of anyone in whom the fires of personalized desire have been transmuted into higher octaves of impersonalized love. Such an one is not only the priest--he is his own altar and his life is his Mass. His re-generations are the sacrifice that he offers daily so that life may be made more on-going and up- going. The joyousness of Scorpio is ecstasy because its expressions are released from the most intensely compressed and focussed of our potentials and aspirations.

JUPITER--ruler of Sagittarius: the joyousness of teaching; this planet is polarity of Mercury's Gemini--as such it is the radiation of wisdom; its position as ninth house-sign of the Great Mandala and fifth house sign of Leo tells us that all true teaching is an expression of love. The student (Mercury-Gemini) being loved, is taught; the teacher (Jupiter-Sagittarius), loving, teaches. Jupiter signifies the joyousness of all religious exercises, ceremonies, rituals, and festivals-symbolic dramatizations which align human consciousness to higher perceptions of life- principles. Exalted in the Moon's sign, Cancer, Jupiter represents a more purely self-directed joyousness in acts of giving--it is true giving which is devoid of ulterior motives. It is the joyousness of all truthful expressions by which the miasmas and distortions of ignorance are dispelled by the power of true teaching; instruction concerning the existence and nature of the Law of Cause and Effect represents the teaching--joy of Jupiter in its purest basic form.

SATURN--ruler of Capricorn: the "wordless" joyousness of legitimate responsibility-fulfillment; the powers of a matured consciousness that enables a human to function as a "corner-stone" of family, nation, and race. The joy of planning by exercise of the matured mind and carrying out the plan efficiently and thoroughly, step-by-step, until fulfillment is realized. The joy of awareness of capacities to assume, without exterior compulsion, that which must be fulfilled. The joy of living with rectitude which does not "confine and inhibit"--it matures the consciousness for evolutionary progress. This joy is deeply parental in essence; it is that of the father, in human terms--and that of the Redeemer, in higher octaves of consciousness. 

URANUS--ruler of Aquarius: when the human has integrated his consciousness through many incarnations of adherence to Spiritual Law, the joyousness of Uranus blooms as that of the joy of the liberated soul; such a one "dances where he wills, but he treads not on another's toes." This is the joy of creative genius and of prophecy; it is "Love that perceives the Soul of another"--it is no longer the "love that worships the body." It is the joy of all impersonalized group cooperation--it is the radiation of fellowship, which is fraternity extended into limit- lessness of scope. It is "creativity" or "manifestivity" by which the beautiful truths of the human archetype are recognized and acknowledged. This vibration is the joyousness of revolt by the human against those things in himself which have impeded his realization of true fellowship; it is the joy of alchemical exercise by which congestions and inhibitions are released into octaves of greater expressiveness; it is the joy of all resurrections--the "transcendence of all tombs."

NEPTUNE--ruler of Pisces: the joyousness of dynamic prayer; the "breathing of one's Self, with Love, into the ethers;" the, expansion of consciousness that results from focussed meditation and the resultant clearer perception of idealities. The joy of all inspired artistic expression--particularly that of the musician and the actor. It is the joy of inspirational at-tunement--and that of the heart's deepest and purest reverence. By Venus's exaltation herein, this is the joyousness of loving life itself and that of loving everything that life expresses. It is that love that creates beauty and the joyousness of perceiving life's most subtle and lost pure beauties. It is the truthful perception by which all hells are redeemed--by it, saints and saviors heal the wounds of body, mind, and Spirit. It is the joy of renouncing the "no longer needed" to "embrace the now-required." It is the faith in which all true progressive steps are taken--a faith made possible because love of life itself has recharged the consciousness and translated the agitations of fear, hate, and insecurity into the serenity of peace and wisdom through joyousness. 

### <h3 id="chapter-6">Chapter VI: Shakespearean Star Portraits</h3>

From the resources of his imagination and knowledge, the playwright chooses those elements of the spectrum of human personality and experience, which are appropriate to his concept of a theme, and he organizes those elements into a dramatic form which is to be interpreted by actors, actresses, and all others who function in the theater. All forms of art are distilled representations of human consciousness; works of art, like mirrors, reflect to humanity intensified representations of itself and its experiences. The playwright deals with human consciousness, emotion, and experience in terms of humanity's objective expressions; dramatic themes are presented and interpreted by humans in terms of objectively recognizable patterns of appearance, personality, activity, and relationship. Actors and actresses in performance are symbolic microcosms of humanity's own self--each role performed by an actor or actress is symbolic of a fragment of humanity's consciousness of identity and existence on this plane.

Therefore, in the creations of a true genius such as William Shakespeare was (or whoever it may have been who wrote under that name !) a protean quality of artistic skill and understanding made possible the dramatic characterizations which reflect the human archetype, localized by name, sex, period and nationality but which really symbolize universal patterns of human nature and experience. Sooner or later, we all come face to face with the Hamlet, the Cordelia, the Othello, the Lady Macbeth, the Romeo, and the Juliet in ourselves. We weep or laugh by response to these--and other--characterizations because something in our deep subconscious knowledge of ourselves is stimulated when we see great acting which interprets the creative imaginings of a genius play-wright. Our own existence--past or present--is reviewed to a degree. Old, long-forgotten feeling-memories of suffering and joy are ignited. Our awareness (consciousness of individualized self-hood in many incarnations) is reawakened, and what we see on the stage is ourselves, condensed and focussed by the dramatic requirements of the theme being interpreted. We are man-woman, all professions, all nationalities, all relationships, all strivings, all failures, all joys, and all sufferings. The playwright, through the esthetic principles inherent in creative dramatic art, and the players, through the esthetic principles inherent in interpretative drama the art recharge our consciousness of our total being, our total identity as individuals, and our total relationship to all other individuals.

Students of astrology: prepare a copy of the Great Astrological Mandala, a twelve-housed circle with Aries Ascendant, the other signs in sequence--thirty degrees to each house; Sun, Moon, and other planets in the signs and houses of their dignity. Meditate on this mandala a little as the symbolic composite portrait of humanity. It is from this design and symbol arrangement that all human horoscopes are derived and it represents the total of that which is interpreted, creatively or otherwise, in all of the fine arts. It is the picture of humanity's consciousness of its identities and experiences. Now, to specialize on dramatic art, "personalize" the Sun, Moon, and planets as characters in the Drama of Human Life; let your mind range over the scope of these "personalities" by imagining each planet (vibratory focalizer) in each one of the zodiacal signs, each one of the environmental houses, each aspected (by conjunction, sextile, trine, square, and opposition) to every other one. Add the factors of both sexes, all ages, all nationalities, all historical periods and you will glimpse the tremendous spectrum of that which is "grist" for the playwright's mill. You and I are in this picture--as we are, as we have been, and as we will be as long as our identity is "human being." You are now playing the role that your consciousness of life has created. Humans, in their Earth-living, are both playwrights and performers--each uses his consciousness to interpret life.

The Art of Theater, more directly than does any other art-form, makes possible the stimulus in human hearts to tears and laughter. Weeping and laughing are two of the ways by which life makes it possible for us to decrystallize the solar plexal tensions and congestions. In response to the contrived agonies, sufferings, longings, and despairs in dramatic tragedy, we are moved to weep in memory of our own agonies and sufferings. In response to buffoon-ery, satire, and caricature, our intellects are "tickled"in such ways that we are moved to shake loose in laughter in witnessing the reflections of our absurdities, awkwardnesses and embarrassments. In witnessing romantic drama (of the happy ending kind) we thrill to intense emotions, deep love, aspirations, efforts, and the realization of ideals. The occult purpose of tragic drama is to induce the feelings of sympathy for other humans--not the intensification of self pity. That of comedy and satire is to decrystallize congestions on pomposity self- righteousness, hypocrisy, and over-seriousness--to "shake us down from our high horses." Romantic drama has its inner purpose in intensifying our awareness of the "tone, color, and design" of our living--to spark awareness of greater capacities for love, devotion, effort, and aspiration. The "happy ending" of romantic plays is dramatized symbolism of the aspiration of all humans to realize ideals and evolve through regeneration and transmutation. The "happy ending" reminds us of the goodness of life.

The poetry and nobility of Shakespearean dramaturgy holds up an immense mirror in which humanity may see itself. Let us enjoy a consideration of some of the Shakespearean characterizations as they represent "focalized points" of human nature and human-experience patterns correlated with basic, simple astrological symbolism:

ROMEO AND JULIET: from a reincarnationists standpoint, this drama would have been much more truly tragic in tone and effect if the two "star-crossed lovers" had permitted crystallized adherence into family-prejudice to prevent or disintegrate their love-union. The "Romeo and Juliet" in each human is that which longs for the total polarization called the Hermetic Marriage; but this "inner union of the self with the Self " can be realized only by fulfillment of relationship unions and patterns through love: The "houses of Montague and Capulet" are the "graven images" of family prejudice and social position which are represented astrologically by the diameter Cancer-Capricorn and congested aspects to Moon and Saturn. We all derive our incarnation from a family pattern to which we are attracted by the laws of vibratory sympathy and karma. However, each must, in due time, decrystallize congestions of this pattern, from octave to octave, by more purely individualized love-expression. Romeo "o'er leapt the walls" to be with his Juliet; this "o'er leaping" is Uranus decrystallizing or transcending the boundaries set by Saturn, symbol of "congestion of forms." Personalizing a little--Romeo and Juliet were timed, evolutionarily speaking, to prove the power of their love for each other; their challenge was through the enmity, rivalry, and prejudice of their family groups. Though they died, their tragedy was ameliorated by their devotion to each other--rather than, in fear, to the "family-image." We all, at one time or another, have an incarnation in which we have opportunity to prove the sincerity of our heart's highest aspirations and ideals. To do this, we have to use the powers represented abstractly by the diameter Leo-Aquarius to transcend the fixations on Cancer- Capricorn. To remain fixated on Cancer-Capricorn is to back-track on the evolutionary powers working for liberation and progress. The luminous poetry of the Balcony Scene represents the radiant purity of resumption of true love; Romeo and Juliet loved each other from a past incarnation just as we love our ideal self through all of our incarnations. The inspirational beauty of the play--as poetry--typifies the inner radiance that accompanies recognition of our ideals.

KING LEAR: This drama is the tragedy of judgment corrupted by greed for approbation--doubly tragic because when the truth is perceived, the inner negatives are too deeply etched to be counteracted by constructive or regenerative effort. The realization of the hypocrisy and dishonor of the two oldest daughters, whom he had over-valuated, and the sincerity and fidelity of Cordelia, whom he had underestimated and spurned, caused Lear to react with such an excess of self-revulsion that madness ensued. Astrologically, it seemed that Lear is a portrait of "Jupiter afflicted." He based his favorable estimate of the oldest daughters on their protestations of devotion and affection--indicative that an insincerity in his own nature was counterparted by their falseness. Their greed for land and money and husbands of high position was counterparted by his greed for approbation. We can--we do--weep in witnessing the heartbreaking tragedy of the demented lying in his excess of self-loathing because we, too, have been moved by desire and greed to claim the false and spurn the true. The realization of such misdirected evaluation causes one of the most terrific kinds of disillusionment, the kind that can disintigrate our self-control if we are unable to learn from the disillusioning experience. Lear worshipped the false image of himself, synchronized in degree with the falseness of his two daughters. Because we can be Lear, it behooves us to exercise counter- actives to negative Jupiter-patterns by discrimination, sincerity, and detachment from subconscious creed-symbols and compensations. Cordelia personifies sincerity of self-evaluation--the quite-knowing what is true and real. When we spurn Cordelia, we enslave ourselves to false, betraying images; when we love and value Cordelia, we refuse the false and cling to the pure and true.

OTHELLO: This dramatic study of the destructiveness of jealousy warrants a little psychological consideration. We are never--in any true sense of the word--jealous of another person. Jealousy is self-hatred based on an actual or imagined inferiority which, in turn, is based on some phase of unfulfillment of a potential, or some discolored facet of self-evaluation. Othello, if we personalize him a little, may have felt inferiority because of his black skin, particularly in relationship to his white wife, Desdemona, who truly loved him. Iago symbolizes the craftiness and duplicity of self-justification--the disinclination to exercise self- honesty. Othello's murder of Desdemona symbolizes the "murder in consciousness" that we commit when, goaded by intense negative rationalizations and justifications, we "murder" true self-evaluation. By exercise of these negative rationalizations, we ascribe truth to an untruth, and our feet walk a tangling path until we fall. The qualities of nobility that Desdemona loved in Othello represent those virtues in human beings which inspire love and honor; but Othello, blinded by the inner negative, could not realize and value the truth of himself. Iago, symbol of Othello's enmity within himself, emphasized the untruth--representing Desdemona as having been unfaithful. Othello, under pressure of the psychological negative, preferred to believe the lie. Goaded beyond endurance by the inner pressure, he murdered the thing he loved most--the truth of his marriage to Desdemona. Mars as co-ruler of Scorpio, is the destructive--killing action by which we express our releasements of intensely compressed Scorpionic negatives--the levels and areas of untransmuted desires and emotional powers. The salvation of Mars is transmutation by constructive, intelligent expression in action. Othello betrayed himself twice: by giving ear to Iago's suggestion, and then putting into action that which represented his desire to "kill out" what Iago influenced him to believe. A nobleman, worthy of love and honor, had thrown away all, by focus on his unreal self rather than on his Reality. We "kill" when we put into action our belief in an untruth about ourselves. A truly tragic theme.

CLEOPATRA: The death of Cleopatra by suicide does not in any way neutralize the power of the play Antony and Cleopatra as an example of high romantic drama. Cleopatra, as a, woman-character, symbolizes the combination of Sun and Venus elements in human nature. According to historical and Shakespearean representation, she was magnificently endowed with attributes of physical beauty and charm, intelligence, culture, and skill--a woman so conscious of inner powers that she lived always in terms of amplitude. She had enormous wealth--and used it without stint. She had great capacity for love--and gave herself to love royally and completely. Whatever her short- comings may have been, there was nothing in her nature that was mean, petty, sordid, or vulgar. A great actress--such as Katherine Cornell--would project these qualities of character and personality in such a way that the audience would experience a recharging of its desire and aspiration to "live bigly"--in terms of power, wealth, beauty, culture, intelligence, and skill rather than continuing to live under the ignominy of capture and degradation, Cleopatra chose to end her life by her own hand; thus symbolizing THAT in human nature which wants to learn to live in terms of dignity and self-respect. Some of us crawl from time to time, through fear or feelings of inferiority; but we do not like ourselves for it and sooner or later we rebel against the inner negative. The "Cleopatra in us" symbolizes our disdain of the petty and mean; "she" is that in us which makes us long for vivid experience, met and fulfilled with courage and confidence in our abilities. We all have talents, ambitions, aspirations, and longings; the vibration of the Sun--as ruler of the royal sign Leo--is that which we use as the power of self-determination uncluttered by the down-draggings of "littleness feelings and thoughts."

BEATRICE AND BENEDICT: Much Ado About Nothing is one of the most delightful and delicious of comedies. It presents in a sprightly and sparkling way the "old story of the battle of the sexes"--source of much that has been presented throughout the ages in comic drama. The posturings, tricks, and devices which men and women display in relationship with each other are represented by the counter-clockwise turning of horizontal diameter--Aries-Libra of the Great Mandala. These two signs represent the polarization of the expressive individuality of humanity--as "male" and "female." Each of the two signs of this diameter symbolizes facets of personality which are peculiar to maleness and femaleness, but together they form one diameter; they appear to be "different" but each counterparts the other. Cosmic drama, in relationship to this subject, makes it possible for us to come into a more healthy appreciation of our subjective polarity through laughter. Humans are innately bi-polar--we have all had much experience in the sex opposite to that in which we now express. When we recognize that "opposite sex" is simply our "subjective self " we can enjoy and appreciate our "hidden selves" as we are portrayed on the comic stage. In laughter we relax subconscious feelings of tension and when we guffaw, roar, and shriek at the antics of comedy actors and actresses who are interpreting the--sometimes--ridiculous interplay of men and women in relationship to each other, we refreshen our viewpoint toward human polarity. Beatrice and Benedict are the protagonists of Humanity destined to fall in love and have experience together--regardless of silly prejudices, false self-esteem, and "images of disinclination." Life works continually to incline us toward each other for our mutual development and fulfillment of potentials symbolized by Aries-Libra. Benedict is Mars who sees the charm and lovableness of Venus in Beatrice; Beatrice is Venus who needs the "kiss of Mars" to awaken her to a clear realization of her value as a woman. There is a little of Benedict and Beatrice in each one of us--we may spat and quarrel for a time but sooner or later Benedict-Mars and Beatrice-Venus bring the play--of our relationship experience--to a happy end by their union. 

### <h3 id="chapter-7">Chapter VII: The Faculty of Intuition</h3>

Intuition: our winged inner sense, the magical perceptive power by which a human after many, many lives of conscious regeneration, purification, and simplification, is able to effect an instantaneous realization of spiritual fact or law inherent in any expression of phenomena, experience, or relationship. The presence of this perceptive power or faculty in the consciousness of a human is evidence of his dedicated pursuance of truth and dedicated endeavor to spiritualize his autonomy (self-rulership) through Love.

Egos who have evolved this faculty have appeared in many places throughout human history, but they are now incarnating in greater numbers than ever before. These persons, in degree, represent a vanguard in the evolutionary preparation for the New Age; they bring in from their developments in past lives the evidence of the potential of Intuition possessed by all humans and which all humans are eventually to develop and express. The present expansion in scientific exploration and invention externalizes this "New Age advent" because the human's ability to invent mechanisms and instruments is based on intuitive perception of principles. Consider for a moment that mechanism which most perfectly externalizes the intuitive faculty: the electronic calculator. This mechanism produces, almost instantly, the accurate solution of mathematical combinations and problems so complicated that highly trained people require hours to solve them. Recognize, by correspondence, that human intuition in action is based on the same power of accurate, synthesizing perception that is externalized by this fabulous machine.

The word "intuition" is directly derived from two Latin root-words which, together, mean to look into. By the synchronized action of our two eyes--the polarized physical expression of visual perception--we look at things. Even the study of an X-ray picture reveals only that aspect of the physical which is beneath the exterior surface. It is by the action of the single eye of truthful perception, externalized in the physical as the pituitary gland, that we "in-to- it-ively perceive that which is with-in the physical, that from which the physical proceeds. Every single mechanism ever devised by humans represents an externalization of an intuitive perception of a principle of the cosmos. Think of the genius possessed by the human who first intuitively perceived the principle of the wheel and reproduced that principle in physical form! Or the principle of the boat, or the use of fire, or the principle of the radio, or that of motion-pictures; all of these devices, from the simplest to the most complex, were perceived as applications of cosmic principles to form and the perception, in each case, was experienced inwardly as intuitive functioning. It has been said, with truth, that a human cannot invent a device or mechanism the principle of which does not have correspondence with an actual or a potential faculty of the human. The converse can be stated: The inner-power of humans can discover ways and means to externalize each and every principle of the cosmos which has correspondence with the human's potentialities. The old saw holds true: there is nothing new under the Sun; there are only different ways to externalize what is perceived "under the Sun" and the perceiving is always some degree of intuitive action. Only the higher faculties make possible the perception of that which is "new," and of all these Intuition is the one which most directly gives evidence of the "regeneration of the self by the Self."

One of the most perfectly pure correlations to be found in the entire realm of Astro-philosophy is that of the faculty of Intuition with the planet Uranus. There is complete correspondence in every point of this two-fold identification. Uranus is the liberative principle in the cosmos. Intuition is the most completely liberated faculty of the Ego; Uranus is the principle of synthesis, the faculty of Intuition provides the Ego with the most complete synthetic perception of things under consideration; Uranus symbolizes the purity of impersonal love, Intuition is that clear power of the Ego when it is completely free of the biases of prejudice--personal approval and disapproval; Uranus, in the realm of generic consciousness, symbolizes the perfect polaric balance of the true androgyne (man-woman). Intuition is that power of the Ego to draw on the deeply-hidden resources of knowledge and understanding derived from snaky past incarnations as finale and as female; Uranus, as ruler of Aquarius, symbolizes the apotheosis of the consciousness of fraternity; Intuition makes it possible for a human truly to perceive the similarities and correspondences between his own experiences and those of another human; Uranus symbolizes the Un-bound and un-binding apperception of Love; Intuition is the un-bound and un-binding apperception of truth inherent in any phase of phenomena or experience. Of all the planets in our solar system, Uranus represents that tendency to act, or to affect, with maximum speed- the transcendence of the limitations of time; Intuition acts with a speed that is designated as " time- less "--when it arises in consciousness to fulfill the requirements of directed attention it "just happens" and there are not words in our language that can describe the "instantaneousness" of its action. Only the experience itself can serve to "describe" it. Intuition, as the spiritualization of love united with the apperceptive power of the mind, can reveal all things, just as Love fulfills all things.

The study of a natal horoscope with regard to determining intuitive power or inclination must include a correlation of Uranus, the symbol of the faculty itself, with the mental equivalents of other planets in terms of aspect-pattern and dispositorship. All planetary points have mental equivalents, just as they have physical, astral, and spiritual equivalents; each planetary point designates a certain "kind of thinking" because each one depicts kinds of things upon which a human's mental attention can be focused, whether it be some object in the material world, a personal environment, an event, or a relationship.

Of the nine other planetary points, three are specifically representative of mental faculties, the other six may be understood, in terms of mental equivalents, to represent mental attributes. The three "mental faculty planets" are Moon, Mercury, and Neptune. The Moon symbolizes the instinctual mind, the reservoir of memories from past lives, the production mechanism of the mental faculty. Mercury symbolizes the conscious mind, the correlation between the brain and the sensory perceptions by which the human gains information of the exterior world, the mental power to identify specifically, to compute, to analyze, to study, and to communicate by speech and writing. Neptune symbolizes the faculty of the inspirational mind; it is the special mental principle which characterizes the creative and interpretive artist, it is the subtle mental faculty by which a human receives and apprehends communication from Higher Planes. These three planets may be considered to be the mental triad which characterizes communicative action: the Moon, as the instinctual mind, communicates the secrets of the past to the awareness of the present by producing effects which correspond to the stored-up memories; Mercury as the conscious mind, communicates the secrets of the external world to the mental awareness of the person and represents inter- communication between persons; Neptune, as the symbol of the inspirational mind, is the mental faculty which identifies channelship between the relatively higher to the relatively lower.

Referring to the trine aspects as representing the relative fulfillment of intuitive development, Moon trine Uranus identifies the intuitive awareness of needs and their fulfillment, the awareness of how the progress of human groups may be furthered, the "new age" consciousness of the principles of home- life, provision and protection; more than any other one aspect, Moon trine Uranus is the planetary insignia of the "emancipation of women," the liberating of mass- consciousness from ignorance, prejudice and crudeness, the electrifying reformation of the personal instinctual consciousness by internal apperception.

Mercury trine Uranus, more than any other aspect, identifies the intuitive knowledge of the scientific genius; it is the basis, in the mental body, for that which makes possible all discovery and invention. Children with this aspect very often reveal great ability in their studies at school. It is evidence of specialized knowledge brought over from studies and inquiries in past lives. These persons have exercised great independence of spirit in their intellectual pursuits in the past. They often reveal great ability in foreign languages, in which case the evidence is shown that in their present studies they are really recapitulating--"bringing to the surface"--much knowledge of languages gained in the past.

The Uranus-Neptune aspects have to be evaluated by correlation with the entire chart; these aspects are cyclic or "epochal" in nature and only by a careful analysis and synthesis with the basic tendencies of the chart as a whole can the predominance of intuitive or inspirational mental abilities be determined. All humans who come in with the aspect of Uranus trine Neptune comprise a life-wave who are, in a general sense, more at-tuned to the effects of higher forces. They, as a universal group, represent a cyclic emphasis of relatively progressive and spiritualizing consciousness. The most highly evolved of these people-- regardless of historical timing of incarnation--make a. great contribution, through their revelatory and inspirational powers, to the progress of the race. Those highly developed who come in when Uranus is square or opposition Neptune are evolutionary transposers, their timing of incarnation brings them in when dissolution of that which is outmoded and crystallized is needed by the race. These timings are always characterized by conditions of upheaval, revolution, terrific tension and conflict, but the Uranus factor of the highly evolved persons identifies them as "workers for the future." They have the apperception of that which is to be and, having intuitive enlightenment, they work to initiate those steps, methods, and procedures which will result in the new manifestations which characterize the future.

There are three other planets which, when correlated to Uranus, represent marked intuitive characteristics: Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus. Uranus correlated with Jupiter, or the ninth house influence gives a high degree of interpretive artistic genius, is intuitional and imaginative, spiritual qualities possessed by the Guru, the Teacher, the spiritual-law Interpreter and, in large degree, the Healer. Uranus trine Jupiter gives evidence of higher development of the abstract mind, the intuitive apperception of symbolism and principle. Uranus-Saturn identifies clairaudience and that quality of intuition which makes possible necessary reforms in the social, political, and business life of humanity. Uranus-Venus, one of the insignia of creative or interpretative artistic genius, is intuitional apperception particularly directed toward the comprehension of relationship; Uranus trine Venus gives evidence of the power to perceive the impersonal values of relationship and the ability to respond to a very high quality of spiritual affinity in relationship; it is one of the insignia, perhaps the principal one, of "biune love" or "soul-marriage."

Considering Mars as the co-ruler of Scorpio--action which releases the Scorpionic resources of desire-power--we may consider the aspect of Uranus trine Mars as being primarily an evidence of great capacity for action by which intuitive tendencies are directed for the fulfillment of enterprise. Mars "thinks" in terms of "how, what, where, when can I do;" Uranus trine Mars, therefore, could well be understood to represent an intuitive perception of right action. If Pluto may be considered as the planetary ruler of Scorpio, then Uranus trine Pluto indicates the intuitive faculty to be "backed up" by an enormous resource of desire-power and emotional force. This aspect is one which could be understood to be a "planetary insignia" of a magician-black or white. In the chart of a highly evolved, spiritually- minded human, Uranus trine Pluto could represent one whose reformative power is tremendous, both as regards his own personal regeneration and the power he may direct toward regenerating or transforming another individual or society at large. Externalized, this aspect could be thought of as the explosion of the first atomic bomb, opening up a new era in human experience regarding the knowledge and use of newly-perceived octaves of power.

Regarding Uranus and Sun we will give special consideration because the Great Astrological Mandala (the twelve-housed wheel, Aries Ascendant, the planets in the signs and houses of their dignity) gives us the clue to the essential evolutionary root and spiritual meaning of the faculty of Intuition, as a potential possessed by all humans. The Great Astrological Mandala is the abstract astrological significance of earthian humanity and any point of faculty or experience which humans have in common can be studied from this design. Create a copy of the Great Astrological Mandala, intensify the diameter Leo-Aquarius, draw straight lines connecting the cusps Leo-Aries and Aquarius-Scorpio.

No sign of the zodiac can be fully comprehended without a consideration of its opposite, just as two humans of opposite sex become aware of their subjective polarity by intimate relationship in strong magnetic attraction. To "know Aquarius" we have also to "know Leo," the fire sign ruled by the Sun, symbol of will, purpose, radiation, and individual autonomy. If the Sun is the radiation of love, Uranus is the liberative, transforming quality of love-radiation; if the Sun is the power of the Mind, Uranus is that form of individualism by which independence of thought has been evolved; if the Sun is the potential of Mastery, Uranus is that potential realized in and through all relationships by an increasing spiritualization and regeneration of the emotional nature. Aquarius, as spiritualized love, polarizes and "redeems" the egotistical love of unevolved Leo: Aquarius, through its ruler Uranus, as intuition, polarizes and redeems the "self-centered" mind of unevolved Leo. When Sun and Uranus are considered in their exaltations--Aries and Scorpio respectively--we see the symbolic apotheosis of the human as a Son of God and the human's potential to realize his spiritual identity through internal regeneration the "divine magic," the "creative alchemy," the transmutation by which the dross of the personal Ego is transformed into the White Light of the Spiritual Being. The unequivocal pursuit of Truth, the self- directed discipline and refinement of emotional and mental faculties, the expansion of Love-power through impersonalization, and the ever-more- clarified realization of true spiritual identity are seen to be the steps by which the Master Power of Intuition is focalized, evolved, and perfected in human consciousness. The astrologer looks at the symbols and numbers of a horoscope, but he intuitively looks in-to the chart to apprehend the truths of the person's consciousness. Astrological study for serviceable use and human enlightenment is one of the principle modes by which the Faculty of Intuition is developed in the human being. 

### <h3 id="chapter-8">Chapter VIII: Animal Experience</h3>

This discourse is presented for the consideration of students who in their studies often make inquiries regarding the " horoscopes of animals." These inquiries are, of course, perfectly legitimate- -being germane to a familiar factor of life-experience, one which is of great interest and concern to many people.

Because astrology is essentially a study of consciousness, as a vibratory science it is applicable to any form or plane of life and the consciousness which ensouls and informs that life. If our knowledge of astrology, per se, were greatly extended beyond its present scope we could--all other factors being equal--do the horoscope of individual animals as we do those of individual humans; we could do the horoscopes of planets, solar systems, and galaxies as well as those of minute forms of life which inhabit this planet. When astrology is apprehended as being the study of those principles or laws by which all consciousness evolves, then its useful application to life throughout the cosmos may be perceived by correspondence with the life we know as humans.

However, and here is the rub, in order to comprehend the astrology of other life-forms and life-waves, we have to know the consciousness pertaining to those forms and waves. We can observe and study the evidences of other types of consciousness than our own but we, being "particularly and peculiarly Earthian Humans," cannot apprehend the planes of consciousness to which other forms, sub-human and super-human, are aligned. In fact, many humans have but a dim and distorted comprehension of the consciousness of fellow-humans! Animal-life is informed, from a different center than we are--we humans being much more autonomous and the animals being much more completely under specialized guidance.

It has been told us that of the sub-human evolutionary lines, those that are now mammalian will make their higher evolution through the human pattern. Thus, it is not only of interest but of great importance that we learn to spiritualize our awareness of, and relationship with, the members of the animal kingdom; they are fraternal to us as inhabitants of this planet and we, as the higher evolutionary expression have a decided responsibility to them, as older brothers and sisters have to younger ones in a family--the correspondence in relationship is almost exact.

Therefore, though we cannot "do the charts"of animals, we can study our own charts in reference to our experiences with, and feelings about, sub-human life and thereby expand our consciousness of evolution on this planet. Using the astrological factors that we do use, a chart calculated for the birth time of, for example, a pet kitten or pup would picture the significance of the animal to our experience; the same would apply to the timing of our decision to bring a new pet into the home, or any animal into our personal experience. In the latter case, motivation and purpose would represent the keynotes of the astrological reading; that chart being correlated with our natal chart would picture the inter-related factors of the experience we might have with the animal. A chart calculated for the time when we select the animal could indicate basic points concerning the suitability of the animal to our purpose. Many people find that their relationship with an animal opens up a remarkably significant experience, and these experience-possibilities are what we will study.

Individual human relationship-consciousness is no respecter of persons or things. A man may love his wife and children with tender, solicitous devotion, but if his relationship-consciousness contains an area of hatred, fear, or prejudice toward another man--or other persons--who happens to be of another race or nationality, his relationship-consciousness is not clear or pure. A woman may fulfill the requirements of her professional work with unwavering conscientiousness, but if her attitude toward her colleagues--or a colleague--is tainted with envy or false superiority, then her relationship-consciousness toward her profession is correspondingly tainted.

Many such hypothetical illustrations may be considered; the point to keep in mind is this: our relationship with another person is primarily qualified qualified by our feeling about him or her; that area of feeling is ignited by vibratory contact with the person. In other words, other people symbolize qualities of consciousness to us because by the action of vibratory sympathy, any person can serve to stimulate any point of feeling in our relationship-consciousness. We, until we gain true understanding, tend to identify the person with the quality stimulated in our relationship-consciousness; when we have gained relationship-wisdom, we know that our reactions of an unpleasant nature are to be transmuted into the spiritual potency of good-will (Love). Therefore, all points in relationship-consciousness which we identify as hatred, envy, jealousy, fear, false superiority, tyranny, etc., may be apprehended as being "materials" to use for transmutative exercise. The fact that many, many people have proven the law of good-will through their transmutative efforts may be ascertained by a few moments of considered thought.

Any magnetic focus of relationship-attraction can be utilized to intensify existing negatives in consciousness or to nurture the already-evolved regenerate qualities. And "relationship" is your viewpoint of yourself in vibratory alignment with arty other person, any creature, thing, activity, event, endeavor, or environment. Your natal horoscope performs its greatest service to you in picturing to you your basic tendencies of viewpoint in relationship-consciousness. Truthfully to apprehend these tendencies and the ways of rightfully using them is to obtain the master-key to all other phases of studying your chart. The evolution of the Consciousness of Humanity is furthered in direct proportion as each human learns rightfully to align himself in relationship tofellow-humans and fellow-creatures.

Note carefully the last fifteen words of the previous sentence. That which is now was determined by that which was; that which is to be will be determined by that which is now. Each human of the present period of Earth-manifestation was at one time in the "animal status;" each creature now is potentially a human. In no absolute sense is a human "superior" to an animal; the difference is simply one of evolutionary timing. The truth of this statement will be instantly perceived from considering the fact that all initiates, masters, and adepts--the spiritual vanguard of present Humanity--serve by inspiring and encouraging our spiritual unfoldment and progress. If they, using an absurd hypothesis, were related to us by "absolute superiority," why would we be encouraged in any way at all to "walk the path they have trod"? If we were related to creatures by an "absolute superiority, " there would be no impulse in the human heart to improve the conditions of creatures, there would be no inspirational impetus to love them. Yet, many humans love creatures with unselfish and sympathetic deviation. Is that not in itself proof that we inwardly know that creatures will walk the path we are now treading? The realization, by a human, of his con-fraternity with creatures is a high peak in the course of his evolutionary sojourn; it is a tremendous expansion of his consciousness of Love and such a point in experience is inevitably attended by an increased apperception of the nature of divine love.

Every position and aspect in your natal chart can be studied as representing a phase of, or tendency in, your relationship- consciousness. Therefore, your attitudes toward, and feelings about, sub- human life are also pictured by these horoscope-factors. Since relationship with sub-human life is inextricably inter-woven into the fabric of human evolutionary experience, we will consider this subject as it is abstractly portrayed by the Great Astrological Mandala. For cross-reference, create a copy: The twelve-housed circle centered by the traditional symbol for the Sun; Aries as Ascendant-sign with thirty degrees of each sign to each house; the planetary rulers of the signs appropriately planed in the houses which they "rule." This is the abstract horoscope of humanity, of with your natal horoscope is an individualized variation.

To enter into a deeper sensing of the con-fraternity of humans and creatures, we will first consider the diameter Sagittarius-Gemini, the signs on the ninth and third houses of the Great Mandala which are ruled respectively by Jupiter and Mercury. Jupiter, in the cosmic sense, is the Principle of Organic Function and the Principle of Hierarchy. It is that power of Divine Mind by which every factor of an archetype is conceived in perfect relationship with every other factor, for function, expression and use. (It is the considered opinion of the author that Venus, as ruler of Libras is exalted in Sagittarius; its exaltation in Pisces derives from its rulership of Taurus.) As the Principle of Organic Function, Jupiter represents the growth of parts of a thing in terms of their purpose and in terms of inter-relationship with the other parts of the same thing. As the Principle of Hierarchy, Jupiter represents the inter-related function of things in terms of relative intelligence or relative susceptibility to the forces of intelligence.

In these terms is seen the placement of parts of a thing in relation to other parts corresponding to affinity with directive intelligence. Sagittarius is polarized by Gemini, the third sign of the Great Mandala in counter-clockwise sequence from Aries, the zodiacal significator of the root of fraternal consciousness; fraternal consciousness being that apperception of "parallelity" or "correspondent similarity" in relationship. All the cells of your body are fraternal to each other, being cell-parts of the same body; but the cells of both your eyes are fraternal by specialization. All inhabitants of this planet are fraternal to each other, but all mammals are fraternal by specialization, humans are "specially fraternal" to each other, quadrupeds are "specially fraternal" to each other, birds are "specially fraternal," etc. Each specialization has further specialization but all specializations are grouped in the unity: Earthian Inhabitant. The planets of our system are "fraternal to each other" and our system is specially fraternal to the six other systems which comprise our immediate galaxy. On whatever plane of dimension you care to consider, organic function in terms of hierarchy and fraternity is illustrated. That means that the human's consciousness of fraternity is not complete until he has perceived the value of this inter-related togetherness on this planet with all other creatures, sub-human and super-human. A question naturally arises from this point: what can we humans do, and what must we do, concerning our feelings about the inhabitants of other planets? This question can be solved by each human for himself, in date time.

Service is also a "two-way thing;" he who desires to be well served must in his turn serve well. Animal life has been utilized for service by humans for countless ages of time and in the abuse of service- principles, Man has engendered much uncomfortable karma. The sixth house and the sign Virgo symbolize the human's consciousness of the principle of service; it is externalized by his experiences as a server and by his relationships with those who serve him, animal as well as human. Animal life has been and is sacrificed to serve as food for the human kingdom, but what of the human who abuses the (unconscious) service of animal-life by senseless, wanton destructiveness? The sixth house is polarized by the twelfth house and the sign Pisces; can you see the possibility that many humans, through an act of uncontrolled passion in this life, spend many years confined in prison as a karmic result of malicious destruction of, or hurt to, sub-human life in a previous incarnation? Malice and destructiveness are in consciousness and whether they are directed in action toward humans or toward sub-humans does not invalidate the karmic potency.

Life, through some means or other, provides restraint for those who have, by action, proven themselves unqualified to enjoy freedom. Therefore, if you contemplate the purchase--or other means of admission into your experience--of animal-life for service, make it part of your project to give good service to those who are to serve you. If you are dependent on them for the fulfillment of work-programs, they are correspondingly dependent on you for care and protection. If your attitude toward your sub-human server is one of respect--which is Love you will not fail your responsibility and it will be enabled to perform its maximum of service for you. Also, by mutual experience in Love, you will further the creature's evolution in training and it will further your mundane requirements without your engendering retributive karma.

Many people give devoted care to creature- companions who, at the same time, reveal very limited and constricted attitudes toward fellow-humans. It would appear that karma to the animal- world is being expiated by this type of life-program. These persons are being focalized in the present life on a specialization of the consciousness of life and love; it is possible that only through expressing love to, and giving service to, their "creature-companions" can these persons spiritually polarize their relationship-consciousness so as subsequently to unfold richer and higher apperceptions of respect and good- will toward humans. This facet of human experience would be illustrated by the diameter Leo-Aquarius being cross-polarized by the diameter Scorpio- Taurus. The regeneration of negative emotional residues, represented by Scorpio, being externalized by the stewardship of the creature-life, represented by Taurus, being the way by which the temporarily restrained Leo-Aquarius consciousness of Love is inwardly repolarized for subsequent better releasement.

In conclusion, we will consider the significance of the air-trine to the relationships of humans to creatures. Libra, cardinal- air, ruled by Venus, is the apperception of relativity, the basic, essential core of relationship-consciousness; it is the apperception which makes it possible for any human to realize relationship with sub- human, human, and superhuman life. Aquarius, the fixed air-sign, ruled by Uranus, is the resource of impersonal, transcendental consciousness of love by which a human realizes an impulsion and a capacity to love life itself, through any of its external forms. Aquarius illustrates the love felt by Luther Burbank for plant-life, the love-bond which unites a blind human to his or her seeing-eye dog; it is the regenerated consciousness of love which unites humans in groups to serve the furthering of sub-human welfare. Gemini, the mutable air-sign, ruled by Mercury, and ninth sign from Libra, is the apperception of relationship as fraternity--that en-wisdomed consciousness of similarity by which humans perceive their togetherness with other humans and any or all other forms of life. St. Francis, the inspired and life-loving mystic, called all creatures by the terms "brother" or "sister;" he knew that he was "older brother" to those who crawl and fly and in loving them as he did he apprehended God 's love for him. May Light and Love permeate our consciousness of all of our fellows in life.
