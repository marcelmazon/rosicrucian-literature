### <h3 id="chapter-1">Chapter I: The Wedding Chart</h3>

This discourse on wedding charts is offered as an attempt to clarify to astrological students the processes and meanings of the togetherness of two persons who are united for mutual experience in marriage. It has been felt by the author for some time that to do a chart for the time that the wedding is scheduled to start is not really valid. Herein is presented a little food for thought as to the valid timing of a wedding chart.

From what occult philosophy has to say about human evolution through the processes of re-incarnation, to "be born" really means to "re-appear in the flesh." Since we have all been involved in the re- incarnative process for quite some time now, "to be married" really means "to be married again." It is extremely unlikely that any person now incarnate has never before been committed to the marital estate. We have all done the equivalent of saying "I do" in various languages, countries, and epochs--and in voices either loud or soft. Since "husband-wife" is a specialized identity of "man-woman," the twofold "I do" and the final pronouncements of the officiant (or their equivalents) is really a variation of "I AM;" in other words, as far as this incarnation is concerned, the birth of a new identity. There is a remarkable parallel between the "birth of husband-wife" and that of the individual as a physical expression. Let us consult the Great Mandala:

A circle with the vertical and horizontal diameters; the symbols of the cardinal signs (Aries, Capricorn, Libra, Cancer) at the left point, upper point, right point, and lower point, respectively (the cusps of the Ascendant, tenth, seventh, and fourth houses); from the midpoint of the Cancer-line through the midpoints of Libra-Capricorn and down to the midpoint of Aries, draw a curved line, resulting in three-quarters of a circle; connect, by drawing a straight line, the cusp-points of Aries-Cancer (the points where the cusp-lines strike the circle.)

To digress for just a moment to explain the symbolism of the straight Aries-Cancer line: until you arrive at the half-way point when you walk or drive through a tunnel you are entering the interior of the mountain or hill; the half-way point marks the change of your relationship with the interior and as you continue on from the interior toward the exit; as you pass through the exit you leave the interior. On the inner planes, between incarnated states, there is a "turning point" which is determined by your fitness to reincarnate. The vibratory gravitational pull of your unfulfilled ideals then goes into effect and your preparations for reincarnation begin to be activated. In other words, from that point you are leaving the interior of subjectivity--the "exit" of which is your first contact with your vehicle-to- be at conception.

While you are still in the subjective state but are preparing for reincarnation, things are happening on the objective plane. For example: those who are to be your parents may have recently met each other, recognized the mutual love-attraction and desire for union, prepared for their wedding-ceremony, established their home, effected the intimacy of their union, etc. Or, if another child or other children preceded you into the family, this outer preparation may simply be the mutual decision of your parents-to-be to fulfill their urge for further parental experience and, in response to that urge, they effect the emotional and physical synchronization which results in the conception of your vehicle. Whatever it may be, preparation is synchronized in both the inner and outer states. At the timing that is exactly right for your requirements, the seed of your body is ignited into expression and your vehicle commences its individualization. At the end of the prenatal period you are "born"--which simply means "physically individualized." Your body is, at one and the same time, the chemicalized expression of a desire-object upon which your parents are to exercise their individual and mutual Love-Wisdom resources and your desire to evolve through new expressions of your potentials.

The quadrant in the mandala represented by "Aries-to- Cancer" is the subjective preparation of your incarnation; Cancer is conception; Libra is the objectification of physical sex-to-be and subjectification of complementation-to-be; Capricorn is the solidification of the organism; Pisces, if it were to be shown at the twelfth cusp, is the condensed symbol of the unfulfilled residues of the three crosses; Aries, at the end of the three crosses; Aries at the end of the three pre-natal quadrants, is the symbol of your re-appearance, at birth, in physical individuality--the re-objectification of your "I AM" on this plane. From then on, until transition back to subjectivity, your "I AM" unfolds its potentials through your various relationship-exchanges with other human beings. Give this much thought and reflection--it is the "human picturing" of a cosmic pattern.

With this analogy in mind and keeping the mandala at hand, we will now translate this pattern into terms of the subject at hand-- the significance of the wedding ceremony as the establishment of a new identity of two human beings.

The "subjective turning-point" is the time when each person acts on a thought, a feeling, or an opportunity in such a way that their meeting is the inevitable outcome. Examples: they each accept an invitation (1) to dinner at the home of a mutual friend tomorrow evening; (2) to enjoy a camping trip with mutual friends next month; (3) to attend an exhibition of Chinese art on a certain day next January, or if they are both astrologers--bless their hearts; (4) to speak at a convention of "Star-lit Stargazers, Inc." at West Blubber, Greenland, in 1968. The receipt of the invitation marks the turning-point; the acceptance is the action which draws them, day by day, from the "subjectivity of bachelorhood-spinsterhood" toward the "objectivity of new identity as husband-wife." The time element is, of course, an individual variable, some couples must wait a long time before they meet while others meet and enjoy attraction to each other in sudden and (most delightfully) unexpected ways. The "mutual friends"--or the Board of Directors of "Star-lit Stargazers, Inc."--are chemicalized agencies of the one magnetic Love-power that is instrumental in effecting the contact of the two persons with each other.

The first meeting of the two persons ends the "subjective" phase and this "point in time" is analogous to the "conception- point" of the mandate. Now their togetherness is physically established and the vibratory exchange is, consciously or unconsciously, inaugurated.

From Cancer to Libra in the mandala is the time- element between the meeting of the two persons and their love-recognition of each other. When that takes place (the "maturing of the polarity-awareness of adolescence"), the subjectivity of gender, which coincided with the objectivity of sex in the actual pre-natal period, is mutually ignited by the action of sympathetic vibration; each sees the other as the ideal chemicalized symbol of the subjectified generic qualities--or "complementation" on all planes. They do not "fall" (awful word!) in love; they lift each other in consciousness by the mutual fusion of the best of their qualities. This "mutual fusion of vibration" is the archetype of that which is chemically expressed in the action we call sexual intercourse. Both of these "fusions" are releasements of tremendous resources and they are attended by "more- intense-than-ever-before" realizations of ideal, emotional, mental, and spiritual being-ness. The vibratory fusion organizes the conscious recognition, by each of "need for each other." In mutuality, this eventually leads--according to personal inclination--to the decision to marry; also, according to personal inclination, this is followed by announcement of the intention. The decision and the announcement are symbolized in the mandala by Capricorn at the uppermost point of the wheel--the symbol of concreteness, organization, and condensation--polarity of Cancer.

The emotional state objectified by the announcement establishes the identity of "betrothed" and it should be added that, in this "prenatal" explanation, the sign Leo and the fifth house--following Cancer-- would symbolize the individualized love of each of the persons for the other. Leo is love-radiation--an individualized matter; it is not love-exchange, and all of the "identity-points" of the cardinal mandala are such because they refer to "relationships-by-complementation;" a "mother" is such in relationship to "child" and a "brother" is such in relationship to another brother or to a sister; the Capricorn of this symbol is the objectified identity of individual and mutual, Leo-Libra, "loving and being loved"-ness. In our tradition a ring is given by the man to the woman as a "dramatization" of his uplifted awareness of ideality, the power of which is symbolized by the brilliant beauty of the jewel--usually a diamond, which is the jewel-symbol of the Sun. This ring and the one--sometimes two--used in the wedding ceremony is never, as some have thought, a symbol of woman's bondage to, or enslavement by, man; it is always, because it is a circle, the symbol of the perfect- fulfillment of perfect exchange in perfect union. Mutual decision, presentation, and acceptance of the ring, the formal announcement and the first plan for time and place of the wedding ceremony are summed up in the Capricorn-point. The Aquarius of this fourth quadrant from Aries would symbolize the radiation of invitations to persons who love, and are loved and appreciated by, the betrothed couple; the love-extension to family-members and friends; the parents may feel that they are "losing their children" but actually they are, by the fraternity of Aquarius, gaining a "younger brother and sister." The young couple, at marriage, become members of the fraternity of husbands and wives, and, subsequently, that of fathers and mothers--of which their own parents are "senior members."

The last phase of this "pre-natal" period of the marriage would be the sign Pisces in its regenerate meaning--symbol of faith and ideality. To marry is to signify an affirmation of one's realization of life's good and beauty and also to signify a willingness to contribute to Life of one's resources of Good and Beauty. The Pisces of the mandala symbolizes the wedding-ceremony as a dramatized symbol of the deepest and most heartfelt realizations of human joy, inspiration, and loveliness. The artistry of gowns and formal dress, flowers, and music symbolize Humanity's urge to reach and express realizations of eternal beauty--perfected manifestation. In our tradition, the ceremony usually starts with the first note of the musical prelude or of the wedding-march itself. The ceremony progresses, as we "travel through" Pisces, in points of prayer, meditation, music, and recitation of spiritual thoughts concerning the inner meaning of marriage. The officiant symbolizes in his person the intermediary between the personality and the reality of each of the two people. When he says "I now pronounce you husband and wife," the movement through Pisces--as the symbolic ceremony--is terminated at Aries and the emergence into Aries symbolizes the new identity of the couple as "husband and wife" in relationship to each other and in relationship, as individuals, to their individual life-pattern. Great bursts of music--and this music should be radiant and ecstatic in quality--and the couple walk together for the first time in their new identity. And--God bless them all--always.

Something is often done in wedding ceremonies that is really not in keeping with the symbolism of the ceremony; that is for the officiant to pronounce the couple--at the conclusion of the service--"man and wife." A "man" is an adult, male human being; as such, before he can even consider marriage he must, of necessity, function for a few days, weeks, months, or years as "an adult male human being." The identity that is newly established is "husband," and with the assumption of that identity the man "incarnates" into a new octave of his "I AM" awareness as a symbol of his capacity and willingness to unfold and to express new levels of consciousness, resources, and powers.

With the saying of the word "wife" in the above pronouncement, the statement of new identity is complete and integrated; the "pre-natal period" is finished and the material relationship is incarnated. It is the sincere and long-thought-of conviction of the author that the time of the officiants saying "wife" is the time that should be used for the wedding- chart. Regardless of plans, schedules, and announcements, the marriage is not "fully-born" until that pronouncement is complete. The child's birth-cry and the pronouncement of the wedding-officiant are both expressions of the power of the word--the living vibratory stamp of a new identity; from then on, the new-born child and the new-born husband-wife team are individualized "things- in-themselves;" they are, as it were, "on their own."

If you have the charts of the bride and groom, identify their planetary rulers with the wedding-chart to determine which factor in the chart is "personalized" by each. A wedding-chart is not a "composite of two people;" it is the astrological pattern of a specialized experience. Follow this out by correlating, as much as possible, each planetary pattern of the individuals with the wedding chart for study of vibratory groupings. Then apply to each person's chart the planetary ruler and positions of the wedding chart; this is to study the essential meanings--to each individual--of the experience as a most important factor in the sequence of life-experiences. Having either or both of the individual charts complete would, of course, impose the requirement of studying the progressed aspects-- particularly those of the Moon--to study the individualized chart-action. If you do not have the birth time you will not have the complete charts but you can still group the planetary positions by crosses (cardinal, fixed, mutable) and generic (Fire, Earth, Air, Water) trines and compare them with the planet- groupings of the wedding chart. In either case, since any event occurs between two junctions, apply the previous solar eclipse to the individual's charts (not to the wedding chart because the wedding was not yet "born" when the eclipse fell) and list the aspects that it, and its resultant Full Moon made. If the wedding occurred after an eclipse-month then note also the effects of the lunation preceding the wedding on the individual's charts. Note the effects--on all three charts--of the solar eclipse which first falls after the wedding; pay particular attention to the "point," if there is such, that this eclipse stimulates in all three charts and note the extent of time between it and the next eclipse. This eclipse-pattern stimulating all three charts opens up the first major testing of the people by marriage and of the marriage itself from a certain composite of weaknesses of the two people, as individuals and as a couple. Also, for basic reading, list all "points-in- common" in the three charts; all such planets in the persons' charts that are squared or opposed tell you that--because of synchronization with a planet in the wedding chart--the marital experience brings to the persons an "apex opportunity" to perceive congestions in consciousness; conversely, all such planets that are sextiled will urge the exercise of self-directed transmutation; all that are trined will represent the "marriage's ability" to "bless the people" and through which they will experience hyper-realizations of their ideality. In other words, all of those patterns are experiences that are especially focalized in the marriage. The "uniqueness" of the wedding chart focalizes the individual and mutual uniqueness of the persons.

When you study a wedding chart, pay much more attention to diameters than to separate house-cusps. Marriage is objectified human polarity and the diameters picture the foundations of the "two-in-one- ness" of all human experiences; in other words, the polarity foundations. Finance-stewardship is second-house--eighth-house; children are fifth-house-- eleventh-house, etc. The seventh house of a wedding chart, in its squares and oppositions, sums up the vibratory power that challenges the integrity of the union.

All this is an excellent exercise of your synthesizing ability as an interpreter, an important phase of your service and a delightful stimulus to everything in your nature that makes you love astrology.

One more suggestion; try reading your own natal horoscope as a "Marriage chart;" philosophically speaking--you figure this out--that's exactly what it is! 

### <h3 id="chapter-2">Chapter II: Marriage</h3>

For the pursuance of this material create mandalas as follows: (1) a Great Mandala: the Abstract Horoscope with Aries as the Ascendant-sign, including the Fire and Air trines--Aries, Leo, Sagittarius/Libra, Aquarius, Gemini); (2) a sign-mandala with Gemini as Ascendant; (3) a sign-mandala with Libra as Ascendant.

While "complementation" is the word-symbol that refers to vibratory exchange in general, "marriage" is that specialized form of complementation that includes interchange with a person of the opposite physical sex. In its most complete expression--vibratorily and physically, the generative exchange is evolved; but many times a man/woman relationship does not--or cannot--involve this physical exchange; even so, we recognize our "other selves" in those persons who most completely complement us and our relationships with them are, perhaps, the most intensely "focused" of all our relationship-patterns and experiences.

The quality of natural spontaneous joy that is found in significant relationships is resourced in the fraternity of the two people to each other. By the quality of our vibratory being at any particular point in the timing of our lives we magnetize to ourselves people who not only complement us-- "we need them and they need us"--but there is an inherent "simplicity" of each to the other. This simplicity is evidenced in a kind of "natural familiarity," an "easy recognition" that is quite different from the instinctive "uneasiness" that people feel toward each other when their fraternity is not recognized. (To have "no recognition" is "indifference" and no relationship results from the contact.) Mankind tends to fear and to hate that of which he is consciously ignorant; by this kind of recognition he sees others as "separate from himself" and the natural tendency to "defend himself from that which is not understood" takes the form of instinctive antagonisms and frictions. When we realize vibratory fraternity with even the most complete strangers we experience an easy attraction which may rapidly flower into friendship and happy beneficial exchange.

The mandala with the Fire and Air trines pictures the essence of this quality.

This mandala pictures a two-fold expression of the dynamic trine; the abstract of this trine is the Fire-trine; existence as power expressing with love and wisdom; its counterpart is the Air-trine initiated by Libra as the polarity of Aries; the two together form the six "points" of the sextile aspect--the mechanism of decrystallizing congestions. Give a little thought to this "trine-aspect symbol" as spiritualized expression. Now we will refer to our second mandala--the wheel with the sign Gemini as the Ascendant; connect the Ascendant with the fifth cusp (Libra), the fifth to the ninth (Aquarius), and the ninth to the Ascendant; thus creating the mandala of fraternity--since Gemini, as the Ascendant-sign, is the sign which refers to the third house of the Abstract Horoscope, and is the "root" of Humanity's fraternal Love-consciousness.

In this mandala of fraternity we see the picture of basic brotherhood/sisterhood as the initiating point for the flowering of Love-Wisdom; brothers and sisters, playmates and fellow-students in child- hood; fellow students of any age, people who are similar in vocational or avocational interests, those who have a similarity of spiritual goals, those who enjoy the same things, those who are learning the same life-lessons. When we contact our "vibratory brothers and sisters" we recognize them; to the degree that we are free of congestions we easily--and sometimes quickly-- establish acquaintance with them; we have an "affinity" with them that makes possible this "good vibratory recognition."

The experience of "falling in love" is an intensification of this vibratory affinity. In the Gemini mandala, Libra is on the cusp of the fifth house--the Love-aspect of the trine is now seen to be complementation of marriage and this vibratory recognition composites the most complete realization of "other-self-ness." The fraternity of brotherhood- sisterhood is here seen in an extended form of intensely focused complementation of one man and one woman whose fraternity with each other is the need for experience in the marital relationship. "Marriage" is here seen to be a twofold love-radiation and twofold stimulation by love-power. It is also the picture of the intense joy of lovers--the complementation is an ignition of the highest emotional octave of which each is capable at the particular timing of their lives. Truly, the love-joy of lovers is a radiation of beautiful and inspiring light--it charges the hearts of all with its ideal picturing. (Study your chart with the Gemini cusp as Ascendant.)

Let us again look at the Great Mandala--Aries Ascendant--with special reference to the Gemini-Sagittarius diameter. Gemini-- the "root of Fraternity"--is the twelfth house sign of Cancer, the mother- sign; it is the ninth house sign of Libra, the wife-sign; Sagittarius is the twelfth house sign of Capricorn, the father-sign and third (fraternal) house sign of Libra and ninth house sign of Aries, the husband-sign. Let us interpret the house sign patterns in this way:

Since Aries-Libra--the horizontal diameter--initiates the lower and upper halves of the circle, Gemini-Sagittarius is seen to be the modulation into the vertical division of the wheel, represented by the vertical diameter of Cancer-Capricorn. Virgo-Pisces is the modulation forward into the next expression of Libra-Aries. Mercury, through rulership of both mutable signs Gemini and Virgo, is the key-planet of modulation and adjustability into new octaves. Mercury, from a generic standpoint, is androgynous; it is "neutral" in the sense that it is not specifically masculine or feminine but is, in fact, inherently both. The quadrant initiated by male Mars is modulated by Mercury-Gemini (female sign, masculine gender) into the next quadrant, Cancer; which is ruled by the Moon and is, being Water, female-feminine; through Virgo (male sign, feminine gender) Mercury modulates the second quadrant and the lower half-circle into the third quadrant and the upper half-circle through cardinal Libra, ruled by Venus which is complement of Aries-Mars. The "masculinity" of the Air signs, initiated by Libra, simply pictures the "positive qualities of woman-nature," the masculine gender expressing in female sex or the initiation into upper octaves of consciousness by perception of the ideal reflection of one individual by another. Libra and its house--the seventh--is the portal to the temple of the soul; Aries--and the first house--is the portal into new experience by incarnation and by establishing a new octave of self-awareness. In Aries we say "I AM;" in Libra we extend our "I AM" into "WE ARE"--the transformation of separative self-consciousness by the power of Love- Fraternity; Love-Fraternity dissolves the "spaces" between ourselves and other human beings; we--and they--reach out vibratorily to each other and the "gaps are bridged" so that we and they are composited. The consciousness of individuality is thereby amplified into new and higher octaves of realization.

It is the personal belief of the author--here presented as "food for thought"--that Pluto, as ruler of Scorpio, is exalted in Gemini, the root-sign of Love-Fraternity ("exaltation" is "generic maturity"). When we respond to an ignition of our inner wisdom and realize our fraternity with another person, our subconscious mind begins automatically -- as fire automatically burns upward--to decrystallize the congestions of envy, jealousy, and hatred, thus enabling us to "throw off negative ballast" and we, as a result, rise in vibratory quality. (These negative qualities are resourced in intense congestions of unreleased desire-power.) Further--let's look at the Scorpio Mandala--the twelfth house is covered by Libra, initiator of the Air-trine of which Gemini is the third ("Wisdom") octave; Venus, ruler of Libra, is herself "matured" in Pisces, the twelfth house sign of the Great Mandala, ruled by the identity principle of Neptune. The intensely compressed desire-quality of Scorpio--as the "thing incarnated" in this mandala--was impelled into "incarnation" by the marriage-complementation of Libra--harmony- through-perfect-vibrational-exchange is the redemption of the intensely compressed potentials of the Scorpio vibration. The "wisdom octave" of any of the four elemental (generic) trines is "that which is learned about Life from experience"--in contrast to the third-house-sign pattern (which refers to Gemini in the Great Mandala), which is "that learned through intellectual exercise;" third house pattern is integration of intellect; ninth house pattern is integration of consciousness through experience, and "EXPERIENCE" means RELATIONSHIP since it is only through relationship that experience has any particular meaning for us; nothing else identifies an experience except the way we feel about, and react toward, other people.

So--Fraternity is the distilled essence of what is learned through Love-Relationship; when the intense potentials of Scorpio are constructively released we are, sooner or later (even if it takes years of incarnations), alerted to the brotherhood/sisterhood of all complementary relationships. The painful and terrible reaction we call "jealousy" is nothing but Fraternity that "has not yet seen its own face;" it is fraternal Love- attraction which, as yet, sees only differences, not similarities. The pain of this emotional reaction--a releasement of Pluto-Scorpio--is a deep-reaching one. No reaction of jealousy is to be taken as TRIVIAL or INSIGNIFICANT-- because it represents a timing for the greater unfoldment of fraternal Love; until the adjustment in consciousness is made--either as a "taker" or a "giver"--the subconscious will retain the "pain-pattern." The Scorpio Mandala- -with Libra as its twelfth house sign and Taurus (also ruled by Venus) as its seventh house sign--tells us how to deal with these intense pain-reactions: learn to perceive and to appreciate the best in the other fellow; appreciate him for his light and learn to emulate something of his regenerate qualities-- for, somewhere along the line, he is "high" where you are yet "low;" he has evolved something that you have yet to evolve--your pain-reaction is a moan of unfulfilled hunger from your sub-conscious which wants you to release something of your potentials and express more extensively. Don't waste time in envy--admire, appreciate, and learn from the person toward whom you tend to have this reaction; he is--whether he knows it or not--your "elder brother" from whom you can learn something of great importance toward realizing your ideal self.

We must, for clarity's sake, focus on the seventh house in this discussion, even though there are several ways of analyzing a chart with regard to "complementation." The seventh house is your marriage experience and, in a natal horoscope, it must, by its very nature, represent your relationship with a person--or with persons--of the opposite physical sex. Planets in your seventh house represent a focalization of principles represented by the signs they rule which find their most complete expression in the field of complementary relationship. Not everyone actually marries, in the sense of becoming someone's husband or wife; but everyone has a seventh house with a particular focalization of Life-principles and vibratory qualities represented.

Planets in the seventh house which are in the seventh house sign or intercepted in the seventh are the most definite focalizations of vibratory qualities to be dealt with in the marital relationship. These planets will represent a condensation of your experience-needs and will, consequently, represent a relatively strong compulsion to marry. Planets in the seventh house but in the eighth house-sign are a little different; these planets represent qualities which you need to regenerate--and the "ignition" of this inner need is brought to you in some form of intensely focused relationship-- which may, or may not, be with a person of the opposite sex or the same sex. Many times people are alerted to their most necessary regenerative need through contact with a person of the same sex--and until this regeneration is made, the other person will "appear as an enemy" to the subject.

The first step in vibratory analysis of the seventh house as indicator of marital experience is understanding of the two signs on the horizontal diameter of the horoscope. This diameter is the polarity of "you and your complement" and all astrological students should "ground themselves" in a philosophic approach to the diameters found in the twelve signs--one of our most important steps. Then, of the planets that rule the Ascendant (and sign intercepted in the first house, if there is one) and the seventh cusp (and its intercepted sign, if there is one such).

Determine the generic quality of these rulers: MALE SIGNS: Fire and Earth; FEMALE SIGNS: Air and Water; MASCULINE SIGNS: Fire and Air; FEMININE SIGNS: Earth and Water. Compare the generic quality of these house-rulers with the physical sex of yourself and your partner to determine which of the two is, basically, the more masculine and the more feminine; compare the general generic quality of both charts by synthesizing the generic qualities of all planets in both charts; the relative value of both charts as far as congested (square/opposition) aspects are pictured and the relative value of regenerate aspects; determine which planet, in each chart, is the most intensely congested and see how the other chart alleviates that congested planet. Do this with all congested patterns to determine how each can help the other to rise in vibratory quality.

A most important clue is given by the placement of your planetary ruler in your partner's chart, and his/hers in your chart. Your ruler is in a certain sign, having a certain generic quality. The placement of the chart-rulers in the other person's chart will give the clue as to the focus of influence that each has on the other. If your planetary ruler is conjunct a planet in your partner's chart, then your influence is enhanced greatly for good or ill--because that planet in your partner's chart is your personal identification in his/her life and you can, by the way you express your ruler, "make or break" your partner by the way you identify yourself as that particular planetary influence. Also, apply his/her ruler to your chart and see if it conjuncts a planet in your chart: if so, study that planet with might and main; the regeneracy of that planet is the purpose for which you are drawn to your partner--if the planet is congested. If not, then its expression, on your part, makes possible a "channeling" of constructive effect on him/her and the picture is therein shown that that particular planetary vibration will "condense his/her need of you." So, it is incumbent upon you to exercise your regeneracies so that your Light, not your "darkness," will be the "gift" that you make to your marital experience.

Then, of course, synchronize the two charts so that you may determine all mutual planetary conjunctions. These are "power-houses" by which light is generated in your relationship of marriage. Study the generic qualities represented by the sign-placement of these conjunctions to determine which phase of polarity is being exercised by the two of you together and study the planet that disposits each conjunction--that is very important because the planet that disposits such a conjunction represents the focalized life-principle that the two of you are, jointly, "working on" through the mutual conjunction.

Remember that your chart is your chart and therefore a picture of your consciousness. Your seventh house is your inner picture of marriage; as such, recognize the value of realizing the ideal represented by your seventh house ruler; it is the principle that your partner should alert you to, and is the ideal that you are, in your Inner Being, most earnestly seeking to realize.

To conclude, with a brief survey of the Libra mandala--the abstraction of humanity as a reflector of that which is of the soul.

The basic feminine portrait of Humanity--the faculty that every man and woman has of reflecting to others ideal realizations of them by perceptions of their inner light. Virgo is on the twelfth, so service is the redemptive key-word of marriage; the service that is performed by the fulfillment of partnership is the releasement of light through regenerating our reactions to each other and to our experiences together. The placement of Gemini on the ninth is a key-word that the wisdom-resource of marriage is in fraternity of each to the other; "Fraternity" is "parallelity;" when we, in consciousness keep side by side with our partners rather than "higher and lower" we truly "take hands in loving companionship"--and each can, with comparative ease, learn from the light of the other.

Those who have fulfilled the marital experience are much more aware of true Friendship--Leo is on the eleventh cusp of this mandala. Personal love-power is--or can be--released with great effect from the source of a loving and fulfilled heart to the extensions of impersonal relationships. Aquarius on the fifth tells us that the creativity of love, in marriage, has its impersonal meaning; we must not invite Egos into incarnation by making "graven images" of them; if we want to fulfill marriage through parenthood, we must do so in love, not with egotism and possessiveness. As parents, humanity fulfills his/her obligation by assisting the begotten to find its own realization of individuality and--having found it with integrity and clearness of perception--it must be liberated to its own fulfillments and experiences. The children grow up and go their ways, but the parents who love each other remain together. Their fraternity as husband-wife-brother-sister is integrated by love-wisdom and they are inwardly free to let their children find their maturity in expression of individuality on all planes. The fulfilled husband and wife stand, hand in hand, as a living symbol of the fraternity of men and women--as loving and beloved children of our parent-- Father-Mother God. 

### <h3 id="chapter-3">Chapter III: Fatherhood</h3>

This discourse, pertaining to a specialized human identity, will be dealt with by considering a correlation of mandalas. Three will be required: (1) The Great Mandala--Aries Ascendant; (2) The mandala of Love-Power--Leo Ascendant; (3) The mandala of archetypal Fatherhood-identity-- Capricorn Ascendant. For each of these, apply the zodiacal sign-symbols in sequence, the circular symbol of the Sun at the center and the personal-Sun symbol (the horizontal line and semi-circle of the rising Sun) in each Leo- house.

First--to consider the significance of Fatherhood- identity as a factor in the pattern of the Great Mandala, the horoscope of the archetype, Humanity. Capricorn, the upper of the two signs of the parentage-line (the vertical diameter) is the exaltation-sign of the male principle, Mars. Exaltation, vibratorily speaking, is maturity, and the maturity of the self-conscious, separative quality of Mars is found in the assumption and fulfillment of legitimate responsibilities. The responsibility implied in Capricorn as one of the two factors of the Cancer-Capricorn diameter, is that of providing form as an expression of Love-Power. The diameter of Cancer- Capricorn is the polarization of the Principle of Matrix; it is, in human terms, the essential design, or pattern, which identifies the human form.

The arch-symbol of matrix, is, of course, the maternal sign Cancer; it is the Mother who provides the essential seed from which the human form is emanated in gestation. The polarization of this arch-principle of Capricorn is the impregnation of the form-seed by the male aspect of the Principle of Form-begetting. As such, the human identity is Father--the male personification of that which represents, to the Begotten, the security of recognizable Form. Insecurity is one of the two arch-roots of negative conditioning; frictional and congestive aspects involving Moon and Saturn, are, in astrology, insecurity-patterns. Saturn, ruler of Capricorn, is initiator of the Earth-trine (Capricorn, Taurus, and Virgo)--the principle which identifies this trine is stewardship of begotten form. This refers to the begetting and guidance of children (Capricorn), life-sustainment by material exchange (Taurus), and work-expression (Virgo). Moon-Cancer is the security-symbol of the immature human; the immature ones find security in the nurture, protection and sympathetic affection represented by the Moon as symbol of the mother-instinct. Saturn-Capricorn is the security-symbol of the mature human; the mature ones assume and fulfill responsibilities, they perfect their expression of potentials in contributive action relative to the large family, Society.

If Cancer symbolizes our tendency to cling to that which protects us externally, Capricorn and the Saturn-vibration symbolizes our urge to establish our own individual security by regeneration of consciousness and expressing from that basis. Through Cancer we are the citizens of a family-group; through Capricorn we are citizens of the larger family of state, nation, and race; the archetype of this citizenship is, of course, our identity as Earthians--fellow-inhabitants of this planet of the solar system.

Everyone--male or female--has Moon-Cancer and Saturn-Capricorn somewhere in the chart. These picture the biune security symbol of Humanity. In each incarnation we specialize our archetype; we carry subconscious instinct-memories of experience as the opposite sex from one incarnation to the next; we also carry aspirational urges to realize unity all through our sequence of incarnations. That in which we default, through ignorance and desire-congestion in one incarnation, we experience retroactively in the next, or a subsequent, incarnation. A female can learn a great deal about fatherhood principles through her experience as daughter, wife, or mother in relationship to males who outpicture her past fatherhood defaults. A male actively recapitulates the essence of past fatherhood- defaults by (it starts in each incarnation with this) his subconscious reactions to his father when he is in the immature, impressionable state. We are magnetized to our fathers by composite of dissimilarities and similarities to them. In other words, our individualized consciousness (ignorance or wisdom) of the principles of fatherhood is that which makes our particular father-relationship what it is in a given incarnation. We do not create our fathers, but our consciousness is the conditioning factor that determines the quality of our relationship with our father. Consciousness always determines relationship-quality.

Now, the mandala with Leo as Ascendant. This is the archetypal mandala of Love-Power, that which is the resource of all emotional reaction and expression. It is the basic source of all emotional identification of relationship and, as the Creative Aspect of Father-Mother- God, it is the one love of which we all partake throughout our incarnations and which we are continually aspiring to realize and express in our relationship with human and sub-human life. Referring to the subject at hand we see that this power is "parented" in our consciousness by the generative force we call desire; the diameter of Scorpio-Taurus is the vertical of this mandala. The sexuality of the male and female gives incarnated form to the reappearance on this plane of a human focalizer of solar power. The personal desire of parents for union with each other masks the archetypal regenerative aspiration which, rooted by Scorpio at the fourth cusp of this mandala, starts as sex-expression but flowers as love-expression.

The Capricorn of fatherhood-identity is seen to be the sixth house sign of this mandala. The diameter of which it is the male polarization (Capricorn-Cancer) forms the sixth-house-twelfth-house diameter of this mandala, and it is analogous to the Virgo-Pisces diameter of the Great Mandala (Aries Ascendant). This diameter is the Principle of Redemption by personal (Virgo) and impersonal (Pisces) service. Since Love-Power is the "thing incarnated" in this mandala, every factor in it is an aspect of Love. The placement of fatherhood-Capricorn at the sixth cusp is, in the specialization of male consciousness, the human expression of Divine Love by willingly assuming the responsibilities (Saturn vibration) to serve the on- going of human life (sixth house) by male expression as a form-begettor. St. Joseph, the human father of Jesus, is a personification of the purity of spiritualized human fatherhood. His parental service and devotion were expressions of a consciousness of the one love to instrumentate the begetting of a perfected human form. A devotional exercise of great power has been performed by millions of humans who have knelt with reverence before images and pictures of this benign Vibration because they, as symbols, convey a sense of the livingness of the loving, protective stewardship of fatherhood as microcosm of the father-hood of the Solar Logos. This sanctified Consciousness, in male form, has transmuted personal, genetic, possessive desire into an octave of spiritualized epigenetic service; he, and his prototypes throughout the ages, symbolize to the inner knowing of Humanity the Love that is specialized in the fatherhood-identity; His purity and devotion are archetypal of that true security which all immature ones seek to receive from their fathers, which all fathers should seek to realize in themselves and which all humans must, sooner or later, realize to be an aspect of a divine attribute. Fathers: turn your natal chart so that your Leo-cusp becomes the Ascendant; study this arrangement as your specialization of the Leo-mandala with reference to the conditions indicated by the Saturn-vibration. What is your consciousness of fatherhood as a Love-Service? How is your consciousness of your own father's love pictured? Do you tend to repeat, in your experience, what you interpreted as defaults in him? For what things do you honor him in your heart and seek to be honored by your own children?

Here, for variety, is offered a reading-suggestion pertaining to literary portraits of highly evolved father-consciousness; you may, as an astrological student, enjoy a stimulus of your inner knowing by consideration of these imaginary archetypal personalities to correlate with your present study of fatherhood principles:

John Evered in "Strange Woman" by Ben Ames Williams; Ling Tang in "Dragon Seed" by Pearl Buck; Stephen Sorrel in "Sorrel and Son" by Warwick Deeping; Phillip Gordon in "Well of Loneliness" by Padclyffe Hall; Lavrans Bjorgulfson in "Kristin Lavransdatter" by Sigrid Undset; David Naughton in "Claudia" by Rose Kranken. The qualities of highly developed masculinity are combined with wisdom and protective strength in these characters which keynote the evolved father type.

Further consideration of Capricorn in the Leo mandala reveals it to be the ninth house sign of the Midheaven, Taurus, and hence the Wisdom-aspect of the principle of Stewardship. The man has, for the most part, been the "bread winner" of human families since primitive times. In such experiences, all Egos--incarnating periodically as males--distill clearer realization of the spiritual principles involved in the material stewardship of Life. It is clearly shown in this mandala that in all families of which the father is the material support, one of the father's basic responsibilities is to teach the principles of right exchange in material matters.

That duty becomes a focalization of his father-purpose in this incarnation. To the degree that he is unaware of such principles will the mother, or others, have to fulfill that responsibility. Right exchange is an aspect of true security and as such it is evidenced in all psychological and spiritual maturity. To the degree that the father is spiritually informed on this matter is it incumbent upon him to guide his sons and daughters in the spiritual preparation of their practical and professional experience. To the degree that he is free from congestion on desire-for- possession-of-things (a crystallizing lockjaw of the consciousness of stewardship) will he be qualified to instruct truthfully. This is wisdom illuminating the practical experience-chapters of human life and no one functioning as an adult male can be considered an evolved father who is ignorant of this Principle.

Now--the Capricorn Mandala: the abstract horoscope of fatherhood-identity; fourth aspect of the Great Mandala and first aspect based on the Earth Element as Ascendant. Because this mandala is that of an archetypal identity, we consider it from a little different standpoint than we do a natal horoscope. The vertical diameter becomes "parentage archetypalized." In other words, instead of male and female parent it is an archetypal instinct--an evolutionary urge--from which the identity is derived. Fatherhood and its polarity, motherhood, is "born of" the evolutionary instinct to transform the two "I AM's" of separative Aries and Libra into the composite "We Are" of the Aries-Libra diameter, herein pictured as the vertical diameter. Because our subject is a masculine specialization, we look to the male significator of this diameter. It is the Mars sign Aries, the matrix of Male Principle, the arch-vibratory symbol of individualized awareness of being. Fatherhood, primitively speaking, results from an action of the male to express his instinctive genetic urge and relax tensions. In primitive stages of consciousness, "love-exchange" is unknown--mating is a fusion of self-ish instinctive urge. But, from repetition through many incarnations the marital consciousness is distilled. The "WE ARE" of evolved husbandhood and wifehood distills, in its turn, regenerated consciousness of parentage principles--the laws of the Cosmos as they specialize through experience as human fatherhood and motherhood. If Mars, as ruler of this fourth house (the psycho-genetic base) is symbol of basic male quality, its ninth house sign, Sagittarius, at the cusp of the twelfth house, is the "matrix" of the spiritual redemption of the father-identity. This redemption is seen in the expressive giving-ness quality of Sagittarius's ruler, Jupiter. In back of every father is the Wisdom Aspect of his individualized consciousness. He incarnated as male, undertook fatherhood experience as an adult in order to redeem through wisdom. "What was good enough for me should be good enough for my kids" is an attitude completely outmoded--it is fatherhood congested. The urge to improve conditions for his children-- esoterically or exoterically--is the evolutionary progress specializing in the father consciousness. Also, Jupiter's exaltation in the Moon's sign, Cancer, pictures the masculine polarization of the Principle of Nurture; the tenderness, generosity, and out-going goodness of Jupiter identify the father as giver--of protection, guidance, and material good. Primitive man, like most animals, was not for the most part concerned with his children as individuals. Jupiter, in father-nature, is a distillment of compassion, sympathy, and interest in children--the result of epigenetic expression through many incarnations. If Jupiter pictures a man's expression of paternal love, as a specialization of Solar Love, Saturn pictures Humanity's archetypal symbol of the fatherhood identity and principle: He who gives form as expression of contributive love, who personifies to the Begotten the protective Principle, who out-pictures the mature masculine vibration, who out-pictures the unregeneracies and regeneracies of the individual's consciousness of the Father Principle and who personifies the masculine cornerstone of society's structure. The unregenerate father is the unregenerate citizen, the incapable teacher, blind to his essential attributes as a focalizer and expressor of Love-Power. The regenerate father, the "White-lighted Saturn," gives and sustains incarnation in Love-service, exemplifies in his person and character that upon which the family and society can build a better structure, expresses an awareness of the guiding truths of Life. He is one who influences and guides by principle, not by personal congestion, and he knows the truth of Love in human relationships.

So--Saturn in a natal horoscope is the instinctive or subconscious father-picture--one aspect of the security urge which is the consciousness of the ever-protectiveness of Father-Mother God. The Capricorn Mandala has the "Love-matrix" Leo on the eighth cusp. Spiritualized fatherhood is sexual expression raised to the octave of love-consciousness. It is not a "hit-or-miss" expression--it is spiritually inspired, spiritually planned, spiritually and beautifully expressed as a releasement of solar power. (Occult instruction tells this over and over.) The spiritual exercise of planned (Self-directed) fatherhood synchronizes perfectly with the essences of the eighth house, the sign Leo and the power of Saturn as a charging of generative experience, by the male, with the utmost resource of Love-Power. 

### <h3 id="chapter-4">Chapter IV: Childhood</h3>

"CHILD-HOOD" simply means "being in a state of involution"--on any octave of experience or unfoldment.

There is not much poetry but there is a great deal of truth in the statement that "the child is father to the man." The man is the result of all of the processes of involution which emanate, in sequence, from the time of conception to fullest incarnated maturity. All involutions are, of course, phases of the one life-direction: evolution. They are timings for organization and focus of faculties; they culminate at the "points" when the faculties can be consciously used and directed. "Conscious directive" is just another way of saying "Maturity."

Before we can undertake a technical approach to analyzing the charts of children, we must get a picture of what our various "childhoods" are; the structure of the Great Mandala will be used for illustration of the involution--and evolution--of human being-ness. The Law of Correspondence will be seen, here, to apply in this way: from Virgin Spirit through incarnations to liberation-from-form corresponds to from Virgin seed through incarnation to transition. From virginity--or innocence--on any Life- octave--we proceed through a succession of emanations, which we call "child- hoods," to cyclic maturities. A concrete example--the process of education: students on the first day of kindergarten, the first grade, the ninth grade, and freshmen in college are "virgin spirits" in relationship to the phase they are entering; the "most virgin" are, of course, the kindergarten students-- they have no educational experience in this life at all. All of these are "children" because they are still in the process of becoming educated. The "childhood of being educated" stops when the person first puts to use that which he has learned; on entering this phase, he enters into the "childhood" of his work-experience; as he applies that which he has learned, he "emanates toward" his maturity as a worker.

So, let us remember that "childhood" is the process between relative points of maturity on any--or all--octaves of Life- expression, as--let this be added--unfoldment of potentials is the process between relative points of happiness.

The start of your incarnation was the timing that determined the end of your necessary experience on the inner planes. From that point, qualified entirely by your karmic requirements, things began to happen that served the purpose of removing your consciousness from subjectivity to objectivity. The seed, nucleus of your vehicle-to-be, was matured within the maternal body; again, at the exact required timing, that seed received the effect of the paternal impregnation and the subjective phase of your incarnation was finished--the objective phase was begun. New childhood.

Now begins the involution, into the composite vehicle, called the pre-natal period. This is the first of your "objective childhoods." For illustration draw a large circle, add the horizontal and vertical diameters; place the symbols of the cardinal signs, as they are in the Great Mandala: 4th--Cancer, 7th--Libra, 10th--Capricorn, 1st--Aries. From a point on the Cancer-line, near the center, draw, through comparable points, a line up through Libra and Capricorn, then down to Aries--three-quarters of a circle. This is the "line of the gestation period"--nine months of time symbolized by nine astrological house-signs--three quadrants. This is the gathering and focalizing of generic consciousness into the etheric matrix and its physical condensation. The ending of this gestation (prenatal) line at Aries brings this particular "childhood" to an end by its "maturity" at birth. Now the composite vehicle is objectified as an individualized expression of the archetypal idea--"humanity." It is not a "new human being" but "a human being reappearing newly."

From the point on the Aries-line where the "gestation- line" ended, move your pencil-point outward--away from the center--a little. From that point draw a quarter-circle down to the comparable point on the Cancer-line. New octave--new dimension. This quadrant is the involution into conscious use of the physical vehicle--the individualized physical childhood. Astrologically, this period is represented by the "parallel voyages" of the progressed Moon and transiting Saturn (the formbuilders) from their natal positions to the first square. The last time that transiting Saturn, in direct motion, squares its natal position terminates this quadrant. More of this later.

Move your pencil-point down the Cancer-line a little and draw a quarter-circle to the comparable point on the Libra-line. This quadrant is the childhood of mental exercise--the training represents the schooling that is obtained by the child in the grades of grammar school. He takes his first steps in learning to understand the symbols we call letters and numbers which is for the (basic) purpose of coordinating and organizing his mental faculties. Then, a new and most vital "child-hood." This point on the Libra-line symbolizes the dawn of adolescence, the emanation of sex- consciousness and the awareness of polarity. On the gestation-line, this point represents the timing in the pre-natal period when the sex-characteristics of the incarnation to-be were objectified and those of the opposite sex were subjectified. At adolescence the physical body manifests the chemicalization of sex-consciousness; the subjective sex-consciousness is manifested by the vibratory response of the person to persons, for the most part, of opposite physical sex. (More of this in the following article.) This subconscious "emanation" of polarity-consciousness represents the "childhood of mate-love." The basic astrological pattern is: Progressed Moon opposition its natal position and Saturn transiting to the opposition of its natal position. Now move the pencil-point out a little on the Libra-line and draw a quarter-circle to the Capricorn line; three quadrants of the wheel and the second square of progressed Moon and transiting Saturn to their natal positions.

At this point--the second on the Capricorn-line--the first maturity after birth is reached. The person has evolved the use of his physical body, his conscious mentality and his erogenous, generative powers.

He is now qualified, as far as equipment is concerned, to leave the status of life-taker and emerge into the status of life-giver. In other words, he can now become a parent. He not only can provide body-substance for another's incarnation but he should be qualified to assume and fulfill the responsibilities attendant on that expression. Anyone with physical equipment, desire-power, and a partner can become a parent, but being a parent involves the exercise of love-power and wisdom-power, as well as desire-power. Therefore, in the fourth quadrant after birth, the person enters the childhood of culminating maturity. This "childhood" is pictured by moving the pencil-point upward a little on the Capricorn-line and drawing the remaining quarter-circle downward to the Aries-line, completing one circle from birth. This period is the psychological-spiritual "childhood"--fusion of all of the personality-elements--physical, generic, and mental. On the wheel it encloses the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth houses. Since the twelfth house abstractly symbolizes unfulfilled ideality, it symbolizes here the testing- time of the 28th, 29th, and 30th years. This period marks the end of the first cycle: progressed Moon and transiting Saturn (direct) conjunct their natal positions. During this "super-birth" time the essentials of the entire horoscope are brought into intense focus. On its octave, it is analogous to the struggle of the infant to emerge from the maternal body. Only this is emergence of consciousness from the gravitational pull of psychological (psychic-emotional-mental negatives, rather than the struggle of one physical body against another. The aspects made by the first solar-eclipse after the progressed Moon's conjunction of its own place are very important to indicate the focus of testing until Saturn has completed its cycle.

It is true that, from a standpoint of karmic conditionings, the gestation-period of a child's body may be attended by very difficult vibratory conditions due to the distresses, negative emotions, and tensions of the parents, particularly of the mother. However, since incarnation is made by vibratory attraction to specific parents and to specific environment, these conditions are outpicturings of vibratory patterns. The conditions are not "causes"--they are, in fact, specific effects of causes which the "child" himself has built from the way that he exercises his consciousness in the past. When we recognize that parentage and environment are effects, not causes, we recognize that we can redeem the quality of our relationship with our parents and the quality of our memory-pictures of our early environment by decrystallizing tension-thoughts and tension-feelings in substituting thought-patterns and feeling-patterns based on Love-Wisdom. Is this not, in essence, one of the principal meanings of the phrase "the Art of living"?

At the end of the period marked by the conjunction of the progressed Moon and transiting Saturn to their natal positions--which is coincidental to the trine, by direct transit, of Uranus to its natal position- -the man emerges from the "emanations" of his six "childhoods"--one subjective and five objective. To sum up: (subjective): preparation, on the inner planes, for incarnation; (objective): (1) The prenatal period, involution into physical and etheric vehicles, culminating at birth; (2) birth to seven years; involution into use of physical vehicle; (3) seven to fourteen years: involution of use of mental faculties; (4) fourteen to twenty-one years: involution of polarity-consciousness, sex-awareness and emergence of the erogenous nature; (5) twenty-one to twenty-eight years: completion of the first cycle of the progressed Moon, culminated by the transit--in last direct motion--of Saturn to the conjunction of its natal position and the trine of Uranus to its own natal position; the latter two take place in the twenty- ninth and thirtieth years. This period is "summing up" of total childhood of the incarnation, the testings which serve to solidify the consciousness for mature years, the inner struggles by which we prove how much has been learned of Life-Principles so far, and then the action of Uranus provides a measure of liberation for progressive emanation.

Since recapitulation is a principle in evolutionary emanations, the next period, ending with the third square of the progressed Moon and transiting Saturn to their natal positions (first square of the second cycle) in about the thirty-sixth year, is a recapitulative period in which life gives us the opportunity to learn from the results of the testing- time of the 28th to 30th years, and to redeem, at least in part, whatever needs to be redeemed. Life does not want us to go from one octave to another all slogged down by burdens of accumulated congestions--the vibration of Uranus is Nature's provision to insure some degree of inner freedom--and that freedom is a direct derivative from whatever we have learned by our testing. After all, the congestion we call "ignorance" is decrystallized only by wisdom "and the truth shall make ye free." This is the period to "fix what needs to be fixed" from the first thirty years and then we emerge, after the thirty- sixth year--having learned things we needed to learn--into the next phase (comparable to the erogenous-sexual period of adolescence), which is the period of greatest creativity so far. Our polarity-powers--higher octave of sexual powers--now dawn for a blaze of expression through the maturities of physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual equipment.

At the end of this period, the sixth quadrant, we come to the modulation into the fullest maturity of the incarnation; a threefold vibratory action takes place from forty-two to about forty-five; progressed Moon and transiting Saturn make the second opposition to their natal positions and transiting Uranus opposes its natal position. This period is another "birth struggle"--of great occult significance: it is the struggle, in consciousness, between the "slowing-up crystallization" of Saturn and the "progressive decrystallization of Uranus--Dying vs. Living. It is a conviction of the author that this "struggle" and its outcome have much to say about the "psychological foundation" and the "evolutionary status" of the next incarnation. At this time we, by our reactions and expressions, prove whether we intend to become inertial or to remain dynamic. Whatever in our consciousness tends to congest and to impede progress is shaken to its roots at this time. If we--in fear--cling to the old and no-longer-needed we build in inertia; if we adjust to needed changes we build in progress which results in a radiant new birth of spiritual consciousness. After this period we climb to the summit of our life-mountain--the fullest maturity of our later years.

Now, a little technical study. Six sets of accurate calculations:

1\. The months in which the progressed Moon makes its first square, first opposition, second square, conjunction, third square, and second opposition to its natal position.

2\. Correlate to each of the above the timing of the solar eclipse which falls (after the progressed Moon aspect) conjunct square or opposition the natal Moon. (The succeeding solar eclipse "opens up" the Moon-patterns.)

3\. The dates on which Saturn, by last direct transit, makes its first square, opposition, second square, conjunction, third square, and second opposition.

4\. To each of the above (Number 3), correlate the lunation nearest the aspect-time which conjuncts, squares or opposes the natal Saturn. These lunations "ignite" the Saturn-aspects in correlation to the solar-eclipses in their relationship to the progressed-Moon aspects. (If your ephemeris provides.)

5\. The period when Uranus, by first and last direct transit, opposes its natal position. Find the timing of the solar-eclipses that conjunct, square, or oppose the natal Uranus in this period. This is the apex of the "shaking up" time--Uranus rumbles and roars at everything he dislikes about Moon-Saturn.

6\. A composite list of everything in the above- mentioned two-point period of Uranus-opposition-Uranus that ignites the natal Uranus by sextile or trine. That is, the progressed Moon itself, solar eclipses and their full-Moons, lunation-patterns and their full Moons, and majority planetary transits that represent stimulation of Uranus according to his powers for establishing inner liberations and progressiveness. Also, the study of the Uranus-opposition-Uranus requires a careful synthesis of the contrast of natal Uranus with natal Saturn to evaluate the relative powers of gravity and progress in the individual chart.

It is also suggested that special attention be given to the progressed Moon aspects in this way: Make a list of the months when progressed Moon, in sequence, makes aspect to every planet which makes legitimate aspect to the natal Moon in the horoscope. Each of the "quadrant turning points" is focalized by the aspects of progressed Moon and transiting Saturn to their natal positions, but Moon-aspects in the natal chart are personal specializations of the Moon-principles and all of these aspects have important bearing on the "turning-points."

When you are reading the chart of anyone, keep in mind what "childhood" he or she is in; analyze the chart for its basic values but keep in mind the "equipment" that is presented for the time of the experience you are studying.

In conclusion: the astrologer's "first quadrant" is in "learning the calculation"--the body of astrological study. All of his other "childhoods"--as an interpreter-artist--are coincidental with his various stages of spiritual unfoldment. 

### <h3 id="chapter-5">Chapter V: Adolescence</h3>

The word "adolescence" means "to continue to grow." In its application to human involution and evolution it refers to the periods on various octaves which succeed each new turning-point. It is the process during which is manifested the unfoldment of potentials after the new identity has been established. Abstractly, "adolescence" is a part of the "childhood" of the octave; it is not maturity--it is the unfoldment toward the maturity of the octave. In music, each "C" inaugurates a new tonal octave--a "turning- point" in the tonal spectrum; the "adolescence" of the musical octave would be al1 the tones between that "C" and the next one--above or below it--depending on the direction of the musical passage.

Abstractly, the "childhood" of human-experience octaves might be designated as "being born," "starting school," "becoming an adolescent," "becoming a parent, or a worker, or a teacher." All of these designations refer to new points of experience. A man who has only one child-- only a few years old--is an "adolescent" in father experience. Another man, who has a number of children who are all adult, or even married and themselves parents, is in the maturity of father-experience. The younger father is in the process of parentage-maturing; the older man has reached maturity in this particular >experience. "Fatherhood-motherhood," as a new turning-point of identity, is established when the first child is born; the experiences between that time and the adulthood of the last child of the family is the "growing-up of parentage." When the "baby" of the family has reached the status of a self- sustaining adult, the father and mother reach their maturity, as parents. The birth of each child into the family is, in turn, a "variation" of the basic parentage identity because each child brings in a different vibratory pattern on which the parents must, in the ensuing years, exercise their potentials of Love-Wisdom. The development of each child is coincidental with a different "adolescence" of the parents, as a fraternal husband-wife "team."

Give yourself a little mind-exercise on the word "adolescent." Turn your attention to many phases of Nature and observe the processes of "growing-up-ness:" the growth of plants and trees and the maturing of their flowers and fruits; the development of young animals and birds; the unfoldment, even, of daytime and nighttime that follows the appearance of the Sun and the Moon on the Eastern horizon. The seeming "arc" in which the Sun and Moon travel across the sky from horizon to horizon is a natural symbol of "manifestation and childhood," "adolescence," "maturity," "decline" and--with the disappearance of the luminaries below the Western horizon--"transition." This is a natural symbol of Cosmic Beauty because it symbolizes the essential pattern of all Life-expressions in their unfoldment of potentials, maturity and, finally, recession into subjectivity.

The subject of this discourse is the concrete application of the word "adolescent" as it refers to a specialized phase of human experience. It is the timing for manifestation of the Bi-polar essence of the individual; he manifests a new maturing of his physical organism, his emotional potentials and a most significant evidence of his karma. (We will-- for simplicity--use the masculine pronoun "he" as the subject; but "he" will refer to any adolescent, male or female.)

The first mandala we will study is a very simple one: a circle with the horizontal diameter; the symbol for Aries at the left point, the symbol for Libra at the right point. From the standpoint of the "on-going- ness" of the individual's life, this mandala is the arch-symbol of polarity, of which the Capricorn-Cancer diameter is the first basic variation. These two signs are "masculine" in the sense that they picture the dynamic individuality--"capable of initiating causes"--of male and of female, respectively. But, in relationship to Aries, Libra is "feminine" because "she" symbolizes the effect from (or reflection of) causes that were expressed by the Individuality.

The two radii which comprise this diameter--appearing as a "single line"--are the archetypes of the two semi-circles. All of the potentials of the first six houses (of the twelve-housed wheel) are implied in the Aries-radius; those of the upper six houses are implied in the Libra- radius. The semi-circles are simply the unfoldments of resources initiated by these two cardinal signs. Therefore it is shown, in a way so simple as to be almost deceptive, that the horizontal diameter itself comprises the polarity- potential of the entire circle.

As a result of the generative action of the parents (Capricorn-Cancer) this line is an effect: horizontal, feminine, resultant, matter, the begotten. But as a symbol of dynamic expressiveness of the individual human, it is a cause--the effect of which is the Capricorn-Cancer diameter symbolizing maturity of the individual, during incarnation in parenthood or any other expression of "life-giving-ness."

So now we see the "magic" of symbology: the Cosmic Principle of Cause-and-Effect, in bi-polar expression (both abstract and generic) pictured by one and the same line. Give this a lot of meditative thought with reference to your own experience as a human. Your expressions as an individual are symbolized by Aries; your emotional-reaction-awareness of your complement is Libra. But--your expressions and your reactions are all you; your complements are living symbols of those elements in your physical and generic being which have not yet been fulfilled by your individuality.

Now, in reference to the four-quadrant, twenty-eight- year cycle of the wheel, the period we designate as "adolescence" is the third quadrant--counterclockwise--from Aries, the one that is initiated by Libra The generic elements which were objectified in the prenatal period are now objectified by new octaves of emotional consciousness and outpictured by other humans. At this "new birth," "I AM" is transposed--as a musician transposes into a different key--into "WE ARE." The subject walks around in time and space and perceives "parts of himself" reflected by persons of complementary polarity-patterns. The scorn, bashfulness, antipathies, etc., which adolescents exhibit toward those of the opposite sex need not be objects of anxiety of parents; fear is the normal, natural reaction of the human-being when he is brought face-to-face with something he doesn't understand. However, when boys and girls respond to the power of attraction of each to the other, in bi-polar couples, we witness the charmingly ludicrous performances of "young things" trying to orient themselves in the distracting, fascinating dimensions of new emotional octaves. Such dramatizings, such tricks, such gigglings and weepings, such dreamings --both by day and by night--such new self-confidences and courages followed by their complete deflations, such vanities and true beauties, such hopes and disappointments, such star- lightings and moon-glowings, such irritations and absent-mindednesses, such fantasies, and such ideals and worshippings!

Not only do the "young things" go through the travail of "new Beginnings" at this time--their parents do too! Sex-consciousness is attended by the need to understand sex; how do the parents, individually and as a team, deal with this phase (it is not essentially a "problem" except in their own minds) of their children's growth as individuals and their own as parents? Family-polarity really "goes to town" at these times: the son (and his girl-friend), the daughter (and her boy-friend), the parent who is husband-father (as well as "older brother" to his son because he has gone through the same experience himself) and the one who is wife-mother and "older sister," all are in processes of union with their unfulfillments-- individually, as couples, and as a family-group.

Sex-education, as is any other phase of educative process, is symbolized by Gemini and the third house in the sense that any little child can learn the names and purposes of "things concerning sex" many years before he becomes adolescent. In the third quadrant of the wheel the educative process transcends the "mere naming of things."

When the child becomes conscious of his sexual nature, his education must involve a learning to understand the principles of sexuality as they manifest in his being and in all Nature. When parents, because of "congestions in ignorance," confine their sex-instruction simply to names (sometimes, pathetically, not even that much) they fail their responsibility to their adolescent sons and daughters. Let us point our attention at the third quadrant of the mandala: Three signs are represented-- Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius; add the symbols of the latter two to the mandala. Libra is the turning-point, the new awareness of "We Are;" Scorpio, Fixed Water, is the desire to sustain the "we are" as its complement, Taurus, is the desire to sustain the individuality. "Traveling through Scorpio" is the releasement of generative resources at puberty, the physical changes, the magnetic processes of sexual attraction and the instinctive urges to make the "We Are" manifested chemically in physical union. Scorpio symbolizes the resource of most intense aspiration to realize the ideal of uniting personality with soul. Anyone in love who addresses the beloved as "my soul" is not being just emotionally fatuous--he is putting into words a recognition that the vibratory nature of the loved one has ignited the lover's consciousness of spiritual identity.

Adolescence is the "pre-natal period of parenthood" and, as such, it is the timing for ignition of the person's inner ignorance and inner wisdom concerning the principles of generation and polarity- relationship. And, in this "ignition," very important facets of "secret karma" are manifested; karmic residues of unfulfilled relationship-patterns are "brought out into the open" after the dormancy of childhood. The adolescent's own latent fatherhood is now emerging as an effect from his expressions as husband-father in his last male incarnation; so with the girl--her previous wifehood-motherhood now reappears for further fulfilling. Since the father and mother have been, up to this time, the living symbols of "man with woman," the emergences of adolescence can intensify the affectional patterns of the child's feelings toward either parent or both of them, or a latent animosity can now appear. The boy has become conscious of "female" as a Life-symbol, so it is to be expected that his feelings toward mother and sister will intensify--according to his generic elements--and a deeper sense of affection and comradeliness toward the father and brother or a growing sense of rivalry toward them (as "fellow males") can manifest. Also "transferences of affection" from husband to son or from wife to daughter can take place in the emotional patterns of the parents because the "new adult male" and "new adult female" can represent, to the parent of the opposite sex, a symbol of new love. Many times the mother tries to recompense herself for marital frustrations by extending her wife-love to her adolescent son and so may a man to his daughter. Absolutely nothing "evil" need be intended by these transferences but when they happen they are evidences--effects--from having repeatedly expressed according to emotional congestions. The often-seen tragic congestions of intense mutual feeling of family-pairs toward each other are evidences of past relationships of a deeply emotional type--the persons are "nailed together" by the magnetic attraction of unredeemed desire forces. If these attractions are not decrystallized by the exercise of mutual respect of individuality, then the relationships take on the coloring that we call "generic complexes" and the adolescent phase, in such case, results in a congestion in old patterns rather than a liberation for greater fulfillment.

If this period is to result in individual ongoing- ness, the parents must exercise their Love-Wisdom as never before and the adolescent must strive to learn more about the principles of generation and relationship than he ever knew before. The parents become teachers and the children become students; this is one of Nature's ways of encouraging impersonalization of the emotional attachments within the family organization. It is "Uranus at work" to decrystallize Scorpio-Taurus-congestions from the past. The emotional and desire-resources of the adolescent male and female must be encouraged to extend into the octaves of healthy individual mate-love. The parent who seeks to discourage this development makes bitter karma. Parents who "exercise this constraint" do so because their own frustrated urges (intense desires) are permitted to transpose normal and natural protective concern into a voracious "something" compounded of possessiveness, egotisticalness, and fear. Herein lies one of the most important responsibilities of parents as thinking people. The woman who makes her son a substitute-symbol for "husband" and at the same time retains the status of "wife" to the man she married is deflecting the reality of her marital identity into something that resembles a terrible illusion. The same for the man who, in compensation for marital disappointments, makes use of his daughter's womanly affections and devotion. Such relationship-mix-ups are tragic and "human tragedy" is summed up in "congestion in desire-ignorance." The transmutation of "tragedy" is releasement of congestions.

When the "We Are"--the marital individuality--of a husband/father-wife/mother team is maintained in mutual Love-Wisdom, the individuality of the son and daughter is automatically respected, since neither parent has need of "emotional substitute-symbols." Then instruction regarding "facts and principles of love, marriage, and generation" can be naturally, intelligently, and inspiringly given and absorbed. Hence the adolescent is rhythmically conditioned to enter the Sagittarius-part of the third quadrant as he or she opens naturally to new realizations of old wisdom. From that, he/she is prepared, in consciousness, to "reach the Midheaven" and enter the fourth quadrant as an adult--a "younger contemporary," as man or woman--of the parents. To give the instruction and to absorb it is to fulfill the Capricorn-Cancer line--fulfilling parentage responsibility and fulfilling the requirements of parenthood-to-be.

(If "learning calculations" is the "childhood" of the astrologer, then his "adolescence" is the study of symbols in their individual and collective significance; "maturity" is in outgiving of what has been learned; as consultant, writer, lecturer, and teacher, the astrologer is "spiritual parent" and he takes his place in the ranks of World-servers; in this service he is in the "adolescence" of his "elder-brother-ship-to-be.")

TECHNICAL: it is suggested, from the author's experience, that the study of the adolescent's chart be made in this way:

1\. Careful analysis of each natal Moon-aspect; of squares and oppositions to planets in Cancer (ruled by the Moon) and their correctives.

2\. Analysis of squares, oppositions, and correctives of aspects to the planet which "disposits" (rules the Moon-sign) the Moon.

3\. Analysis of the seventh house of the horoscope as the resource of the "I Am" that emerges, in adolescence, as "We Are;" that which is to be fulfilled principally in the marital relationship.

4\. List--by careful calculations and in sequence: all aspects made by the progressed Moon to planets which it legitimately aspects in the natal chart before and after it opposes its natal position the first time --approximately in the fourteenth year; "pattern" this listing so that you are made aware of each corrective to every congested aspect; it is necessary to know to what extent the subject is capable of decrystallizing his desire-congestions.

5\. Include in this listing every solar eclipse that falls in this period of the "progressed Moon opposing its natal position"-- even if the listing of progressed-Moon aspects extends beyond the time when Moon-opposes-Moon--and it could.

6\. Include the date when Saturn, by last direct transit opposes its natal position; this and progressed Moon opposition-its- natal-position is the vibratory focus of the adolescent period--the "building- in" vibratory mechanism.

We suggest use of mandalas for focus of concentration in order to release your interpretative awareness of the subject's generic potentials. 

### <h3 id="chapter-6">Chapter VI: Fraternity</h3>

FRATERNITY is parallelity in human relationship. In our endeavor to decrystallize our congestions on "being different from other people," let us focus our attention now on "how like unto other people we really are" by meditating on the Great Mandala called the Abstract Horoscope: a twelve-housed wheel with the symbols of the signs on the cusps starting with Aries as the Ascendant, and the symbols for the planets placed in the houses corresponding to their signs of dignity. The fraternity of all human beings to each other is here illustrated in so far as it is the entire essential astrological symbology of all human beings. It is interesting--and illuminating--to note that physical sex, absolute evolutionary development, and "nationality, creed, and color" are not pictured in this design. The above-mentioned qualifications are temporary levels of expression by which man separates himself from his fellows through his feelings of inferiority and superiority, betterness and worseness, higherness and lowerness and, in general, "differentness." Man differs from his fellows, in any real sense, only in the dimension of time; some of us leave the level of primitivity a little sooner than others and, correspondingly some attain liberation sooner. But, we all travel the same road and we all fulfill the same evolutionary requirements as expressions of the idea "Humanity." When we clearly realize that our reactions of fear and hatred toward a "wrong-doer and his deed" are simply--repeat simply--memory-stimuli of our commitments of that deed in the past, then we recognize that condemnation of a "fellow wrong-doer" is the perversion of what should be fraternal love; he is fraternal to us in so far as he--and we--are parallel to each other in negative exercise of consciousness--the releasing of our vibratory resources in ignorance of principle.

Actually, is not "condemnation of a wrong-doer" a protest of the consciousness in being made to see an outpicturing of its "naughty childhood?" We tend to blame ourselves, at times, when we remember mistakes or foolishness that we have done in past years; does not consciousness, then, "blame itself" when we exercise a reaction of intense negative feeling against something done by another person? Our consciousness is one with that of our brother/sister--essential resource for the expression of the one love and the one wisdom of our Father-Mother-God. We are parallel to each other in being expressions of an idea of our bi-polar parent; the masculine/feminine of each human being is, actually, what is meant by the brotherhood/sisterhood of humanity.

We are parallel with other human beings in our patterns of similarity in suffering. Define "suffering" as "the way in which we involuntarily decrystallize our congestions in consciousness."

We do not consciously invite suffering--the whole impulse of the human nature is to avoid pain and trouble to the utmost; but since we do not consciously exercise our capacities for growth and unfoldment, Life has its way--through rhythmic stimulus of our vibratory patterns--to alert us to needed correctives for the better releasement of our spiritual potentials. Suffering is the stimulus of a vibratory congestion and a parallelity of vibratory conditioning is found in the "doer of the wrong deed" and the one who reacts to the deed with pain; the former is functioning dynamically, the latter functions reflectively; both, in composite, represent the masculine/feminine of the congested pattern. Should not the "parallelity in suffering" be the ground on which we establish our most acutely sensitive sympathy with fellow human beings? What about the person who exacts revenge as a retaliation against a "wrong done unto him?" Is he really "balancing the account in justice?" His commitment of the same--or a similar--deed ties him in parallelity to the one through whom he experienced his hurt--the congestion is intensified and both are further "imprisoned." The negative condition in the basic consciousness is emphasized thereby and both will have to face a more drastic "recrystallization" in due time until the parallelity is mutually harmonized through love-wisdom.

Students ask: "Why for goodness sake, is the third house called the house of brothers and sisters?" Let us see what two copies of the Great Mandala have to say:

Turn one so that the fourth cusp (Cancer) takes the place of the Ascendant; turn the other one so that the tenth cusp (Capricorn) takes the place of the Ascendant. In the first, Gemini is the twelfth house- sign; in the second, Sagittarius is the twelfth house-sign. Basic keyword of the twelfth house-sign-pattern is redemption of unfulfilled ideals; Gemini is the ninth--Wisdom--house-sign from Libra, the symbol of feminine complementation; Sagittarius is the ninth house-sign from Aries, symbol of masculine complementation. Who makes incarnation possible? The Mother (Cancer) and the Father (Capricorn), as the bipolar generative expression of life. In other words, then, why does a woman become a mother and why does a man become a father?

(1) To contribute to the redemption of human life by making possible the incarnation of more "Lights;"

(2) To extend their scope of knowledge and understanding through their stewardship of their begotten;

(3) In present female and male expression to "ignite" knowledge-resources derived from wisdom when each was incarnate as the opposite sex;

(4) To experience "karmic return"--the agency of redemption--by fulfilling karmic relationship-patterns through the experience chapter of parentage--thereby elasticizing the expression of their Love-Wisdom resources through a variation of polarity and gender, in an extension (from the past) of the dimension of Time.

Since the third house is the "twelfth-house-of-the- fourth-house," we see that the brothers and sisters (replicas, in part, of the masculinity-femininity of both parents) on the inner planes overshadow the embryonic seeds in the mother's body. The impregnating action of the father makes this "contact-ignition" possible and those "in the third house" emerge (Cancer-Capricorn are cardinal signs) from the invisible into the visible through incarnation.

In the Great Mandala, the sign Gemini is the "root" of the fraternal diameter, being in the first quadrant of the wheel. Its ruler, Mercury--the intellectual faculty--is neutral as far as gender is concerned; the sign is third of the air-trine initiated by Libra, therefore "reflective" in quality. The mythological Mercury transmitted messages from the gods to human-beings; are not our brothers/sisters messengers from father/mother God to us? It is through our childhood relationships with brothers and sisters--in the physical sense--that we receive our first "messages" or relationship-parallelity and acquaintance with the opposite sex. "Brothers and sisters" also means "fellow-students," "playmates" and "childhood companions:" the "togetherness of children" in the early years of incarnation is the root of "togetherness of men and women" in adult life; the relationship of ourselves with our physical brothers and sisters is a focused, karmic expression of this parallelity. Also, the "neutral" quality--or "androgyny"--of Mercury as ruler of Gemini is symbolic of the passionless-ness (for the most part) of our affections for fellow-children; boys and girls play together and associate simply as "kids"--it is not until the emergence of the passional qualities in adolescence and sexual recognition of the opposite sex that the "differences of male and female" are perceived in a marked way.

Now--an extended approach to the third house (referring to the Great Mandala).

It is the first relationship house in the cycle of the wheel starting with the Ascendant; consequently, it represents our "childhood-relationships" in any experience level. As long as we are new to an experience-pattern, we are children, regardless of how old we may be chronologically. A person who starts a study of anything is a "child" in that particular endeavor. Adults who have congestions to the third house, to the sign Gemini and to the planet Mercury are persons who have difficulty in adjusting to a new mental horizon--and very likely will experience difficulties in adjusting to relationships with fellow-students. In adult years, there may be an "accumulation of negatives" (rigidity of opinions, false-pride, envies, and jealousies, inferiority and superiority complexes, etc.) which have accrued during the years of growth. When such an adult is moved--for whatever reason--to "inaugurate a new learning," these accrued negatives will emerge from his subconscious through his "fraternal contact" with fellow students; he may find his going "a little tough" because of his negative reactions to others and consequently find that the actual mental exercise is difficult. He may blame his age or his not having studied anything for a long time, but contact with other people is the ignition of negatives, and careful observation may serve to prove that his feelings of "un- fraternity" are really the root of his difficulties. (The author's experience in the war--paralleled by that of many other men--bears this out: being ordered to carry out a line of work that was completely new and unfamiliar, the third-house-Gemini-Mercury congestions brought about feelings and reactions of great disturbance and unpleasantness toward fellow-workers; this made the adjustment to the new work very difficult; when, however, adjustment to others was established in friendliness and familiarity--brotherhood--the adjustment to duty-fulfillment became one of harmony and actually, of pleasure.)

The exercise of our third house faculties is focused on exercise of mind; consequently, the impersonality of approach can be a remarkable corrective for unpleasantness through contact with people with whom we are associated in both study (Gemini) and work (Virgo)-also ruled by Mercury--experience. Mentally to let every other fellow-student and fellow- worker fulfill his pattern according to his equipment is a most effective psychological decrystallization of false pride, envy, and inferiority. When we make our goal the best of our own learning and working, we free others from the unpleasantness of our negatives and we free ourselves from inner discomforts, resulting in greater efficiency all around. We cannot have personal feelings about knowledge and work since Gemini and Virgo are "roots" of our impersonal flowerings--Gemini is polarized by the wisdom of Sagittarius-ninth house; Virgo is the "modulation" from the lower semi-circle into the upper semi-circle through the cardinal sign Libra. To perceive and appreciate the abilities and potentials of fellow-students and fellow-workers is to charge the study and work-experiences with the glow of Love-power and congestions automatically loosen.

What are some of the results from holding on to Gemini-Virgo, third-house sixth-house, Mercury congestions? Create the mandala of the mutable cross: a wheel with the cusps of the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth houses covered by the symbols for Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces, respectively. Connect these points by straight lines, forming the mutable square. Emphasize the Gemini-Sagittarius and Virgo-Pisces diameters. A significant thing: the two "lower points" of the mutable square give us a clue to a remarkable "generic composite" through the rulership by Mercury. The masculine polarity is Gemini (female) and Sagittarius (male); the feminine polarity is Virgo (male) and Pisces (female). Herein Mercury is seen to be the only planet which "roots" the entire generic spectrum of two-fold quality of two-fold polarity, hence Mercury's androgynous nature is pictured completely.

Various types of Mercury-congestion may be classified as follows:

(1) Gemini: lack of mental focus, organization, and concentration; this results in superficial inquiry, dabbling, and mental vacillation; Mercury, remaining "childish" is "mental activity, but to no purpose," study without perception, thought without wisdom, speech and writing without pattern or technique; the best that can be said for this pattern is "acquisition of facts" but absorption of knowledge is difficult or purposeless, and expression, without wisdom, can be lacking in truthfulness which, in its turn, is evidence of immaturity. The first line of the mutable cross cuts across the cardinal sign Cancer, initiator of the second (or "family") quadrant and Leo, the resource of love-power, to the second mutable sign:

(2) Virgo--ninth house-sign of the earth-trine, initiated by Capricorn--symbol of service as the wisdom-aspect of the element of earth and the releasement of creative-love potentials as a contribution to life; congested, Virgo is a "doing for material return;" it is "working without knowledge or wisdom;" the slogan "Employer (Capital) versus Employee (Labor)" is an archetypal word-symbol for "Sixth House Congestion;" both capital and labor are workers-in-the-world and only through fraternity can the slogan be reworded into "Capital and Labor as the composite of true service--each fulfilling his part with equity--with cooperation and the best possible personal contribution to the work-pattern; "Capital versus Labor" is service congested and depleted by lack of technical knowledge and (very important) its principle: wisdom concerning human values. Just as fraternal composites are found in the combination such as father/mother, husband/wife, etc., so is capital/labor the composite identity of service. From Virgo the second line cuts across the cardinal sign Libra (reflective complementation) and its emotional resource, Scorpio, to:

(3) Sagittarius: ninth house-sign from Aries, third aspect of the fire-trine, the polarity of Gemini, the radiation of knowledge as wisdom, the fraternity of fathers and the fraternity of our elder brothers/sisters--our teachers, the parents of our Spirits. Congested, the ninth house is theory and abstraction that is put to no practical purpose; it is wisdom that is not demonstrated in daily living; it is religion that emphasizes forms, distinctions, and differences; it is a subtle testing-point in higher octaves of development because the congestion that we call "pride" is herein evidenced in our condescensions toward those we choose to feel are "lower" or "less wise" than we are; it is wisdom utilized to channel expressions of personal power-gratification, thus defeating its own purpose because of being out of line with its own principle; its essence, being congested, is failure to learn from experience, the consciousness being unperceptive of the principles involved in experience-patterns. Just as inharmony and contention between parents can result in the infliction of grievous wounds on the minds and emotions of growing children, so can--with much more drastic effect-- jealousies, envies, competitions, and feelings of unfraternity in the hearts of our teachers, educators, religious leaders and artists inflict double wounds on our minds and emotions because thereby the spiritual work of the world is congested, distracted, and depleted; as children sometimes tend to feel that they are "competitors against each other for the love of the parents," and fellow-workers (Capital OR Labor) are mutual "competitors for income-getting," so our Elder Brothers and Sisters may strive against each other for prestige, acclaim, fame, power, and influence; they should, actually, stand as living symbols of spiritual fraternity so that the consciousness of the "younger ones" may be more securely and certainly lifted in understanding and perception; if they are to "parent" our Spirits, they must undertake to do so with wisdom that channels their love-power. From Sagittarius the fourth line cuts across the apex of the wheel at the sign Capricorn (responsibility-fulfillment) and across the " Soul-quadrant" to:

(4) Pisces and the twelfth house, polarity of Mercury's Virgo and sign of "redemption of unfulfilled ideals;" the fraternity of soul is pictured by this transcendent, Neptune-ruled sign; herein we face the out-picturings of our most serious expressions of "un-fraternity"--our violations against the Divine in man and through it, by karmic-return, we are brought face-to-face with our "fraternity with the worst in man"--the imprisoned, the persecuted, the betrayer of ideals and the worshipper of graven images; congested twelfth house is the "Judas" in each of us--through its picturings we see the "dust" that we have thrown into the eyes of our brother/sister--blinding him/her with illusions; Neptune, congested, sums up the worst that is inaugurated by congested Mercury and congested Jupiter; only the most drastic revisions of consciousness--through realizing and living the ideal--can bring these patterns into constructive realignment; the twelfth house and the sign Pisces are interpreted as "self-undoing" (the one self cannot be undone) because in them we walk into the traps we have set, in the past, for our brother/sister and make ourselves "messengers of darkness" rather than "messengers of the gods."

Gemini (abstractly) and your third cusp (concretely), are the ninth house-sign from Libra (abstract sign of complementation) and your seventh house (concrete); "ninth house-sign" conveys "wisdom aspect;" the wisdom we derived from our last incarnation in the opposite sex manifests in the love we now receive--and happiness enjoyed--with brother/sister of that sex; and, that wisdom-resource makes possible greater unfoldments in this incarnation through our new chapters of fraternity.

The first trine from Gemini is Libra itself--the intensely focused love aspect of fraternity; our husband/wife is truly our brother/sister and the next "extension" to Aquarius, the eleventh house-sign, is the picturing of fraternity in its most widely extended octave--that of friendship, the love-vibration, in parallelity, which unites us in consciousness with all of our brothers/sisters, transcending all barriers of relationship-classification and difference. Fraternity, then, is in the final analysis, the archetypal relationship-pattern of humanity since we all must fulfill all patterns of inter-relationship with each other to fulfill the manifestation, on this plane, of the human ideal. 

### <h3 id="chapter-7">Chapter VII: The Sun Sign</h3>

This discourse is presented as an attempt to give answer to often-propounded questions by astrological students such as: Why, in astrology, is the Sun considered and treated as a planet? What is really meant by "afflictions" to the Sun? Of what significance is the Sun in the astrological consideration of psychological problems? How can the Sun--the Creative Source of our system--be taken as a symbol of "bad karma?"

Looking at a diagram of the astrological wheel without its cusp lines, we are impressed with its exact resemblance to the symbol we use for the Sun--a central dot circumscribed by a perfect circle. As the power-radius of the Sun enfolds the entirety of the solar system so the total symbol of the astrological mandala parallels the Sun symbol. Adding the cusps' lines by drawing them as radiations from the center, we recognize that the Law of Correspondences is being pictured in action: the Sun or the human is seen to vitalize every factor which is the reflection of the consciousness of each. In other words, the solar system of the Sun and the body of the human are objectifications of the potentials inherent in the attributes of each. Before there was vitalization as "energy" there was vitalization as "Light." LIGHT is the archetypal creative fiat throughout the Cosmos on all creative octaves. Creativity expresses Light; Light is that which is revealed by Epigenesis; in Light all manifestation is; by Light it lives. God is Light, and in astrology, the Sun symbolizes man's consciousness of his divine source. The unity that is depicted in the symbol for the Sun--it is the most undiffused of astrological symbols--pictures the focused consciousness which exists to express. The unity of a Master's consciousness is the result of his having transcended darknesses, congestions, and ignorances through epigenetic action in many incarnations in such a way that he has conditioned himself to become relatively perceptive of the One Light. The diffusion of an unevolved person's consciousness is "un-Mastership;" the darknessess of congestion serve to scatter and diffuse the expression of potentials, and the resultant "clouds and storms" obscure his perception of Light. He is at the mercy of his tendency to react to the clouds and darknesses of others--out-picturings of his own darknesses; the Master abides serenely in his perception of the Unity of Life that is Light and Love.

For your consideration--an example of manifestive symbolism originated by the author, which pertains to the subject at hand: an upward semicircle, the end of which rests on a horizontal which extends a little beyond on either side. As a picture, this figure represents a half- circle of the rising Sun above the horizon; as a symbol it is one-half (the upper part) of the circle of both the Sun symbol and the horoscopical wheel. The placement of the traditional circular Sun symbol at the center of the human horoscope, and the use of this new symbol in the horoscope as the ruler, Leo, could clarify to students the differences between the Sun as the creative source of our planetary system and the consciousness of evolving humanity regarding the principle inherent in the sign Leo. In other words, we think of the Sun as the focalizer of the sign Leo, the Love attribute of Father-Mother God, but the new symbol ("half the Sun") could much more easily convey the relative realization of the Central Principle that is held by the individual evolving human. It is placed in the human chart not (horary) just as you would place the traditional symbol of the Sun, aspected by other planets just as though it were a planet.

Actually, the planets, as focalizers of the sign principles, symbolize in their positions and groupings the consciousness of life principles held by the evolving human, but the Central Sun abides as the emanative Source of everything pictured inside the wheel. The houses and signs of the upper semi-circle of the astrological mandala represent the "daylight part" of the Sun's seeming travel around the Earth each day; occultly, these signs and houses refer to the soul-consciousness of humanity; the lower six houses and signs refer to the "night-time part" of consciousness--that of the individual seemingly separated from his fellows.

It is through the vibratory powers of the upper six signs (begun by Venus's Libra) that we enter into the consciousness of unity through the life of relationship; when the "tour" through the zodiac has been completed at Pisces the result is a completed circle--the microcosm of that which is represented by the circle of the Central Sun. The essence of your horoscope, in toto, is your perception of unity in diversity; to the degree that you become focused in consciousness of the one light, will your horoscope dissolve its "separate bits" and emerge--closer and closer--to its essential representation--the one perfect undifferentiated circle: one love, one wisdom as the expressions of the power which is Light. The new Sun Symbol (the picture of Light-radiation of each sunrise) conveys in a practical way the truth that each regenerative expression of a human is a "sunrise in his consciousness" and one revelation of the Light to all who contact him. The radiance, beauty, and truth of our identity as children of Father-Mother-God becomes evident with each evolutionary step.

Since humans, being humans, are not creative but epigenetic, this new Sun symbol could represent the essence of perfect epigenesis--the octave of Creative Power which, in our archetype, corresponds to (not "is parallel to") the power of the Solar Logos. The new symbol is, in the individual horoscope, the Spark of Solar Light; the traditional symbol, placed in the center of the horoscope, is the Divine Source of all Light Sparks, or Power focalizers, of the human archetype of this planet. Every time you look at this new symbol in your horoscope you will impress your subconscious mind with the truth that you are an evolving being, you are revealing your inner light, you are rising to a higher octave of perception of your divine source and your divine identity.

The disorganized, incoherent, stumbling, congested, fearful, hateful, ignorant human is so because he is focused on the diffusion of his planetary patterns; he sees himself separate from all other humans, he sees no common denominator in his experience-patterns, the manifestations of life are, in his reactions and feelings, outside of (and against) him; therefore, living in his inner microcosms he expresses the lesser of his potentials and all of their possible congestions.

The Sun is Master of this system. A human Master is so because he is focused, co-ordinated, harmonized, simplified, refined, and centered in his perception of identity as "begotten of Father-Mother-God." (Herein is seen the explanation for the exaltation of the Sun in the first zodiacal sign, Aries, ninth house-sign of Leo and fifth house-sign of Sagittarius. For reference consult your Great Mandala.) He is clearly aware that he is a focalizer of solar power and he knows that his purpose in existing on this plane is to express that power according to the highest of his epigenetic capacities. His consciousness is fused, his actions are harmonious and efficient, his Love transcends all of the self-created barriers in the natures of less evolved persons. The secret of all mastery is (correspondent to the essence of the Solar Source) UNIFICATION.

In this respect, study the Sun in your chart and recognize that (even if you have to decrystallize a mental habit of many years) the Sun cannot be afflicted. There it abides in the center of your chart, macrocosm of every factor in the chart; it radiates its divine blessings throughout the contents of the wheel. But, your "personal Sun" (like any planet) can be "squared" or "opposed" and it means that, in such cases. your consciousness of Light-Power as Love and Wisdom tends, to a degree, to be limited, dull and ineffectual. The cusp of your chart carrying the sign Leo (as "matrix" of Light in your consciousness) will tell the story of persons, who serve to alert you to the existence of your Light; the placement of the "personal Sun" by sign-position points to the microcosmic planetary vibration (unless the Sun is in Leo) from which you tend to distill your Light consciousness; the house-placement of your personal Sun is the command from the Most High (within yourself) to express light in that particular experience-chapter or relationship-chapter during this incarnation.

In this part of your life, if your personal Sun has squares or oppositions, you will be challenged (depend on this!) by the vibratory powers of other people in order to stimulate your attention to focus on the existence of your Divine Attributes. Some of these people may be tyrannical by nature. You must learn to keep your Light alive and radiant in spite of everything they--seemingly--try to do to you. Others may be inclined to take advantage of your weaknesses in order to use you for their own purposes. You must study yourself and learn how to transmute your energies from disorganization and weakness to strength. (Persons you may know who have no squares or oppositions to their personal Suns will prove to be the best objects for study and the best teachers to help you learn how to unify and focus your potentials.) If you deflect from what you know to be your life- purpose, then you default on Divine Command. If your personal Sun has no squares or oppositions, then the congestions of the planet which disposits it are the focalizations for "Sun-exercise." Through increasing unification and focusing of positive powers, discipline of expression, purification of desire- urges and clarification of your awareness of Spiritual Identity, you are to deal with the problems represented by these "planetary afflictions." Frictional aspects involving planets in the sign Leo are to be redeemed by transmutations of egotistical congestion through expressions of radiative Love--through our Leo-points we must become contributors of the Good, the True, and the Beautiful for the ongoing of Life. Transcendence of diffused separativeness is the action of Mastership; radiation of focused Power as Love and Wisdom is the service of Mastership.

The "first grade" of expression of Power is "power over things and people." The lust to dominate other people, to circumscribe their actions and thoughts is an exercise of power but it is based on ignorance of what power really is. We have the attribute--because we are causers--to influence people if they respond to us, but we cannot influence anyone who is either indifferent to us or who is more perfectly focused and organized than we are. To say "I have power" is to congest the consciousness of the personal-Sun with the urgings of the desire nature. This is an illusion which has made possible innumerable perpetrations of injustice and cruelty, by man toward man. "I have power" implies "I have the right to exercise my power in any way that I want (desire) to." The truth of the matter is "I AM Power" or "I AM a focalizer of Solar Power;" the responsibility attendant on this identity is to BE the best focalizer of Solar Power that is possible. Power is NOT a possession--it is a Divine Attribute and its expressions (radiations) as Love and Wisdom through individualized human consciousness testify to the omnipresence of the Divine on this plane. Release "I have" from your astrological approach to the personal Sun; substitute "I AM." Remember that the "I have power" approach is Leo as the fire-sign initiator of the fixed cross--the four signs that symbolize the utmost compression and congestion of the desire-potentials. "I AM POWER" is Leo as the fixed (centered, focalized, organized resource) sign of the fire trine of Divine Attributes; as such it is the creative Love aspect of Father-Mother God and the resource of every aspirational effort of humanity to realize the ideal of Love as the truth of all relationships. We cannot HAVE something that is not, by its nature, a possession; we can only aspire to BE that which our Divine Source ordains that we are. Perfected radiation (epigenetic action) is the livingness of this True Identity in human terms.

The Leo Mandala: a twelve-housed wheel, Leo as Ascendant and the signs in sequence; the traditional circular Sun symbol at the center, the new "personal Sun" symbol in the first house. This is the abstract astrological portrait of humanity as epigenitors--radiators of focalized Solar Power and expressors of this Power as Love. The desire- diameter of Taurus-Scorpio appears as the parentage-diameter in this mandala-- the sexuality of male and female parents provides reincarnation for a human focalization of Solar Power. The polarity of this focalization (the Uranian air sign Aquarius) is liberation. All regenerate epigenetic action is liberation from the no-longer-needed. The caterpillar needs his cocoon but only when he emerges from its confines does he establish his identity as "butterfly." The mother human nurtures and then liberates the body of her child; both parents fulfill their experience in relationship to their children and then, with respect for the individuality of the children as fellow-human, they liberate them to their own experiences. Does this mandala not show us that parentage-default is rooted in possessiveness? Leo is "married to" Aquarius (Love that does not liberate for greater growth of development, and expression is not love--it is desire to express power on others by holding them static with constraint) physically, mentally, and emotionally; it should be the aspiration to express Love-power for others.

The individualized Leo-Love of each parent for the other expressed through intense fusion by Taurus-Scorpio made possible a liberation from the inner planes of another Ego so that that Ego might progress in his evolution by reincarnation. He, in his turn, is further liberated when his epigenetic radiation is fused with that of another. So we see in this mandala that the "possessiveness aspect" of Taurus-Scorpio is the congestion of human progress; its regeneration is the impersonalized aspect of stewardship. Spiritualized (self determined) parentage is intelligent, loving stewardship of the individual growth of the begotten and respect for the begotten's right to realize the best of his individuality.

The house-sign patterns of the personal Sun as indicated in this Leo mandala are: Leo, 1; Virgo, 2; Libra, 3; Scorpio, 4; Sagittarius, 5; Capricorn, 6; Aquarius, 7; Pisces, 8; Aries, 9; Taurus, 10; Gemini,11; Cancer, 12. (Correlate for clarification with a copy of the Great Mandala (Aries Ascendant) to perceive how the archetype sign-principles are expressed when Leo is Ascendant of the horoscope. For example, the personal Sun in Virgo is practical, not just because Mercury is ruler of Virgo, but because in Virgo the personal Sun is in its own second house-sign, stewardship principle, correspondent to the Taurus-Aries relationship of the Great Mandala. And so forth.

Exoterically, the personal Sun involved in square and opposition patterns pictures karma resultant from ignorance of the true meaning of Power. "Planets are people"--and the squared or opposed personal Sun represents the challenges to your integrity from people who outpicture your past ignorance of this principle. By the very meaning of the personal Sun as an astrological symbol you are to decrystallize all "enmity-reactions" to such persons by (1) learning from their negative example what not to do, and (2) transmute your negatively-colored relationship to them by a strengthening of your inner purposes, your personal integrity and your love-consciousness and radiate that higher octave of consciousness to them. This is astrology's way of saving: "Love your enemies." The converse of a previous statement about Leo is appropriate here: WE DO NOT HAVE ENEMIES; we (by congestion of potentials) ARE enemies to our own best and highest good. The Light that is symbolized by the Central Sun is microcosmically reflected in the personal Sun of the individual human; it and its polarity, Aquarius-Uranus, is the arch- decrystallizer of all "enmities."

In the above statement is seen an answer to inquiries by students concerning the psychological value of the Sun symbol in astrology: To the degree that you remain unfocused will your weaknesses be challenged by the desire-power-authority urges of others; to the degree that you unfold awareness of your true identity as a focalizer of solar power and express that awareness through love in which no shadows can exist will you epigenetically improve the quality of your entire psychological base. The therapy of the Sun is JOY--the house-position of your personal Sun in this incarnation is where you have chosen to banish shadows by the radiance of your purified love nature. You created the shadows in the first place--the squares and oppositions to your personal Sun; only you, as a focalizer of solar power, can redeem those congested energies and transform their expression by constructive epigenesis. With reverence and joy identify yourself with your source--know that Its Power transcends that of any seeming outer negative. This is the therapy that has been given to us by every teaching-Master and in your horoscope (sooner or later) if you knock, the secret of your solar identity will be "opened unto you." Your purpose is not to "be submerged;" it is to love, to express, to radiate, to be a living testimonial to the divine in the human archetype. 

### <h3 id="chapter-8">Chapter VIII: The Generic Spectrum</h3>

In the last few years of the eighteenth century and the first two decades or so of the nineteenth occurred one of the most remarkable stellar phenomena of modern history--the conjunction of Uranus and Neptune, in Sagittarius and Capricorn. This "hyper-lunation" was "seed- planting" in terms of the cosmic vibratory powers of these two giants--rulers of the last two signs of the zodiacal belt.

As a conjunction of any two planets carries out the pattern of the Sun-conjunct-Moon lunation (with its extensions of "first quarter," "trine," "opposition" and so forth), so it was with this conjunction; during the years of the nineteenth century and up through the first fourteen years or so of this one Uranus and Neptune moved, in relationship to the "conjunction-point" and to each other, to make patterns of aspects that represented a turning-point in the vibratory evolution of the human race.

The "Full Moon pattern" of this tremendous aspect was represented by the opposition of Uranus to Neptune; this pattern prevailed when Uranus had returned to Sagittarius and Capricorn and Neptune had gone half-way around the wheel to Gemini and Cancer. This crescendo of vibratory powers on the part of Neptune included the last four signs of the zodiacal sequence (Sagittarius through Pisces) and the first four signs (Aries through Cancer). The objectified climax, shortly following the period of exact opposition in the middle degrees of Capricorn-Cancer, was the first World War- the spewing forth of congested and putrefied energies on the part of nations all over the world and the imagination of an entirely new phase of unfoldment on all planes.

Let us consider this great conjunction in terms of house-sign patterns:

The inception of this conjunction occurred in the abstract ninth-house-sign Sagittarius, ruled by Jupiter, significator of abstract mentality, ideas, concepts, understanding, and philosophy. Jupiter is the Principle of Improvement and of Expansion. In Sagittarius, Uranus--ruler of Aquarius, the eleventh house-sign--was in its own eleventh house-sign, the keyword of which is liberation through universal, or impersonalized Love- Power. This position of Uranus had the effect of an electrification of human consciousness in the form of a vitalization of humanity's need for greater freedom on all planes; there were revolutions like nothing that had been known for ages--by actual warfare and by protest against the effect of centuries of spiritual and intellectual shackling by temporal powers; there was a "blasting open" of horizons of knowledge and thought so that the mental and spiritual capacities of humanity might find "new pastures." New philosophies and religious forms sprang up on all sides that man's need for broader understanding might be fulfilled.

Neptune in Sagittarius was in its own tenth house-sign from its dignity in Pisces; it had reached the three-quarter mark in its own cycle and had come to the point analogous to Capricorn in its relationship to Aries. This was a timing for a new releasement of the powers that serve the purposes of redemption; that which was to be "re-redeemed" was the effect of many preceding centuries during which mankind's ideality had become congested to the choking-point by corruption and perversion of ideals.

In Capricorn, Uranus reached its own twelfth house-sign, the last position in the cycle from its dignity in Aquarius; in this sign, Uranus' influence was to disintegrate outmoded forms to make way for new formations on all planes. In Capricorn, Neptune reached its own eleventh house-sign; a "wave" of Egos (Elder Brothers and Sisters) incarnated during this period who served to act as "instruments" (Neptune is the Principle of Instrumentation) for the down-pouring of tremendous spiritual powers to re- charge the spiritual consciousness of mankind.

During the years of the nineteenth century Egos of great and remarkable development incarnated in, shall we say, "swarms;" philosophers and religionists, musicians, artists and writers, scientists and mathematicians, healers and teachers. These persons, whatever their specific field of activity was, served to bring humanity closer to each other by the tremendous range of their influence. A particularly significant opening-up took place by the advent--in the western world--of the sciences pertaining to psychology and psycho-analysis; a few great minds incarnated during this period who were determined to investigate the principles pertaining to human sexuality, emotionality, and the function of the subconscious mind. To these people we owe an unpayable debt. They pioneered in a field of research that had scarcely been tapped, and they stood strong and unshakable against the powers of crystallization, ignorance, and prejudice in order to bring to mankind a "new Light" toward greater understanding.

In our particular subject at hand--the "generic spectrum"--we will deal, in astrological symbology, with one of the most important of the factors pertaining to the "inner nature" of man's constitution: the factor of bi-polarity.

"Experience as male" and "experience as female" is represented abstractly by the division of the wheel by any diameter; the arch- symbol of this pattern is, of course, the Aries-Libra diameter of the Great Mandala--the abstract or "natural" wheel having thirty degrees of each sign per house, starting with Aries as Ascendant and moving counterclockwise around the wheel to Pisces at the twelfth cusp. The Aries cusp is the "I AM" of human consciousness; it is the projection of all potentials from the center of the wheel to the circumference--the "point of incarnation" or "the objectification on the physical plane." All radii of the wheel are simply emanations of this Ascendant-line, since there is only one radius for any circle.

The horoscope in its totality is the composite of all consciousness of the individual, and this means the composite of all masculine and feminine potentials. Relationship is "within;" it is not, essentially, "outside of the individual." This can be easily proven by consideration of the fact that when you change your reaction to another person, you change your relationship with him/her. The outer aspect of relationship is its picturing in space-time on the physical plane--the mirroring of inner states by their expressions in form. The "maleness" and the "femaleness" of human beings serve to focus generic qualities, both in expression and by reflection. Certain experience-patterns, in actual physical living are peculiar to the male, others are peculiar to the female; each in its own way, is a picture of karma, since we incarnate by law in the dimensions of space-time and the physical expressions of gender: sex.

Since our essential bi-polarity is not, as yet, fully realized, Nature makes possible, by the faculty of emotional reaction, a recognition of our latent generic states. This recognition is found in our relationships with other people, and we identify them--seemingly outside ourselves--by the stimulation that they make of our vibratory being. Because the quality of our relationship patterns resides in our consciousness, we now recognize--when our viewpoint is sufficiently detached--that each human being is his/her own father/mother, husband/wife, brother/sister, and son/daughter. Our generic being serves to identify other human beings as factors in one or more of these basic relationship-patterns--and their many variations--in accordance with our generic patterns and our congested or regenerate levels of consciousness. We do not have enemies; we, ourselves, are the source of what we interpret as "enmity." The regeneration of our emotional-reaction faculty improves the quality of our vibratory being and thus improves our consciousness of relationship with other people. That is the only way we can "defeat our enemies" and redeem relationship-karma.

In consideration of this material, it is suggested that each student try a little "inner adjustment:" stop thinking of yourself as "male" or as "female;" think of yourself--and this may require considerable "elasticization"--as composite of masculine and feminine. Recognize that you, as an individual expression of the idea, "humanity," contain in your vibratory being everything that is meant by the words "man" and "woman." You are simply specializing as male or as female in this incarnation; you may have been the opposite in the previous incarnation, you may be the opposite in the one to come. If you are male your feminine patterns will, for the most part, be objectified by reflection in the "women in your life" and the reverse holds true for females. But--and this is very important--the bi-polarity of our being is coming into clearer manifestation as we evolve through the exercise of our potentials of Love-Power and Wisdom-Power--one of the remarkable phenomena resulting from the Uranus-Neptune conjunction and opposition during the last century and a half. The study of human relationships is no longer centered on the differences between the sexes as much as it is on the similarities of men and women as bi-polar mechanisms. We are coming into a realization that "opposite sex" really means "latent generic quality" which is "ignited" by contact with persons whose vibratory being complements ours, in some degree or pattern.

The astrologer, in fulfilling his/her service, functions--or should function--as a bi-polar consciousness. If he/she is to understand the problems of the client he/she must draw on his/her experience- memories as male and as female in order to perceive the vibratory roots of the client's problems and potentials. The astrologer, in this functioning, is not neutral; he/she is compositing his/her vibratory elements as a ray of Light, focused into whiteness, to enlighten the consciousness of the client to clearer awareness of the source of the problems and their inherent correctives. "Masculinity" and "femininity" are not words of opprobrium when applied to females and to males, respectively They are words that refer to the two-fold expression of our vibratory being which, in the final analysis, is the basic life expression of our inner nature. Cause (masculine) and Effect (feminine) may be said to designate the Life-expression--polarity--of the Cosmos.

The consultant astrologer who does not function with awareness of his/her bipolar reality will not do justice to his work as an analyst of relationship and sex problems. He/she must be able to perceive the combined masculinity- femininity of any one whose chart is studied to assist this person to recognize more clearly the inner source of relationship-problems. The male who does not know or recognize his own femininity is not going to perceive the "woman-part" of anyone he reads for. Truly, our "brother-human" is the masculine element of human nature; our "sister" is the feminine element, regardless of the physical envelope that is worn. Each astrologer should apply his/her analytical powers toward a more clarified understanding of his/her own personal relationships and see, with the Eye of White Light, how he/she affects, and is affected by, each person with whom there is close association. It is necessary to analyze the chart from the generic standpoint to determine the relative masculinity/femininity that is pictured. We now offer, as food for thought, a generic analysis of the twelve signs.

Use a copy of the Great Mandala without the planetary symbols--just the sign-symbols outside the wheel. Notice that the first four signs--Aries, Taurus, Gemini, and Cancer--each represent one of the generic elements: fire, earth, air, and water, respectively; two of these, Aries and Cancer, are cardinal "structure-points."

Since rhythm is the archetype of movement (in time-space), we recognize that the progress around the wheel, through the twelve signs, is a rhythmic progression; the simplest basic rhythm is what we call "two-four" rhythm--two counts, each of which has a down-beat and an up-beat. The down-beat is the masculine "initiation" of the count, the up-beat is the releasement--or feminine complementation--of the down-beat.

In this sector of four signs we see two halves of two full rhythmic beats; "count one" is Aries-Taurus--the down-beat is Aries, the up-beat is Taurus, count "two" is Gemini-Cancer--Gemini is the down-beat and Cancer is the up-beat. Each count, then, has its two-fold generic quality, and the four-fold sector has its two-fold generic quality in its division of two complete counts. Aries-Taurus is, then, the male down-beat of the sector; Gemini-Cancer is the female up-beat, or complementation, Aries and Gemini are the masculine down-beats of each of the two counts; Taurus-Cancer are the feminine up-beats of each of the two counts.

The ideal realization of humanity's vibratory nature is found in the spiritualization of all generic qualities: the "Grand Man" is the perfection of composite masculinity/femininity. So we see how this spiritualization is pictured in astrology: the circumference of the wheel is the seconds, minutes, and degrees of the sequence of twelve signs. There are four groups of trines, each representing the Power-Love-Wisdom aspects of one of the elements. Each element, in three octaves, covers the wheel and each one is a specialization of generic quality. The trines are initiated by the four cardinal signs, each of which is a basic generic statement of "I AM," and each represents one of the structure-points in the total pattern of human relationship: the male as husband and father; the female as complement--wife and mother.

Number the signs around the wheel as follows: Aries-- 1, Leo--2, Sagittarius--3, Capricorn--4, Taurus--5, Virgo--6, Libra--7, Aquarius--8, Gemini--9, Cancer--10, Scorpio--11, and Pisces--12. Place your pencil-point on Aries and travel through the zodiac this way: Aries to Leo to Sagittarius to Aries--to Capricorn; Capricorn to Taurus to Virgo to Capricorn- -to Libra; Libra to Aquarius to Gemini to Libra--to Cancer; Cancer to Scorpio to Pisces--to Aries. This "tour" of the zodiac starts with the most masculine of male signs and ends with the most feminine of female signs; each cardinal sign is the most masculine of its element, each mutable is the most feminine and adjustable. Aries (dignity of Mars) joins the earth-element at Capricorn (exaltation of Mars); Capricorn (dignity of Saturn) joins the air-element at Libra (exaltation of Saturn); Libra joins the water-element at Cancer (dignity of the Moon) as initiator of the water-trine, the third octave of which is Pisces, exaltation of Venus, which is ruler of Libra; the Moon, ruler of Cancer, is exalted in Taurus, earth-dignity of Venus and second--or love-power octave--of the earth-trine initiated by the Moon's complement, Saturn, ruler of Capricorn. Pisces, exaltation of Venus, is ruled by Neptune and represents ideality. Venus's exaltation in this hyper-feminine sign symbolizes the perfected mirroring of the best in humanity's consciousness; the "renunciation" implied by the Piscean vibration is that of giving up the negative, unregenerate feeling-reactions in favor of perception of the inherent ideal--which is goodness, truth, and beauty.

Now we have the entire zodiac "lined up" by generic quality; the whole belt of twelve signs by trine division represents the healing power of three-four rhythm--each element thus picturing a spiritualized key-note in which the music of human consciousness can be played. Each sign, by three-fold decanate-division, composites its element. You can now list your own planetary positions by generic quality, synthesize them with your Ascendant and ruler, and evaluate your listing by comparison with the gender of planets. We suggest Mars, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn (the father- symbol), and Uranus as masculine planets; Moon, Venus, Pluto (ruler of Scorpio--the "womb" of compressed desire-power), and Neptune as feminine planets. Mercury, the intellect, is neutral--or rather androgynous; Mercury, in its rulership of Virgo (a male sign) is masculine; as ruler of Gemini it is feminine. This planet adapts to the sign in which it is placed and adds an emphasis to the generic quality represented by the sign.

Apply this listing to many charts in addition to your own. Learn to "size up" the generic values of charts for practical analysis of relationship-problems. Pay particular attention to all planets that are dignified by sign-placement; a planet in dignity is a "first-house" vibratory placement--a "start" of a new cycle of aspect-patterns to be made by that planet in future incarnations. Also--pay careful attention to the "structural rulers:" Mars, Moon, Venus, and Saturn as respective rulers of the cardinal (structural) signs; also planets placed in the cardinal signs--because they will be disposited by the structural rulers. If you wish, it may be helpful to list the planets of a given chart by their "maleness and femaleness" (fire- earth, air-water) as well as "masculinity and femininity" (fire-air, earth- water). Check the element--or grouping (this is very important)--that contains the most of uncongested planets, or any chart that is uncongested. In this factor, we see a registration of definite spiritualization of generic quality- -an important signification of inner freedom. Also, the structural planet (Mars, Moon, Venus, and Saturn) that is most congested and most regenerate. Study these two planets not only by their aspect-patterns but also in terms of the congestion and regeneration of the planet which disposits it. We must know the generic quality that each planet is focalizing, and this "dispositorship" gives us that key. 

### <h3 id="chapter-9">Chapter IX: Your Life-Assignment</h3>

The verb to assign is defined as "to mark out," "to point out specifically," "to set apart, as for a special person or purpose." These definitions imply that "to assign" is an action of selectivity by which a "something" is indicated to be appropriate or necessary for someone to undertake, to work with, to work on, or to fulfill. The act of assignment is made by someone for someone else or it is self-assumed; in either case, that which is to be dealt with is cognized or recognized to be a legitimate factor of endeavor or experience, a necessary part of an over-all plan or objective.

Whether imposed or assumed, the acceptance of assignment is always a decision to move from a state of relative inertia or relative equilibrium. This acceptance proceeds from a cognition or a recognition that something more or something new, actual or recapitulative, is to be done. All action or "doing" is an extension from that which already has been done or achieved. The evolution of a human during the span of an incarnation is externalized as a sequence of actions proceeding from decisions qualified by reactions to the effects of previous decisions and consequent actions. The regeneration of residual reaction brought into the present life from the past is the basic assignment of any human for any life. The archetypal assignment for all individualized beings through the entire span of sequential incarnations is the conscious reattainment of perfect equilibrium, the state from which we were sent forth, or creatively projected, as innocent Spirits. This projection was made possible by a creative decision of God--in Him we move and have our Being, through us He moves and has Externalization; we are filled-full of Him. He fulfills through us.

Macrocosm is externalized by myriads of microcosms which have correspondent similarity to it. This truth of creativity and manifestation is conveyed by the Hermetic axiom "as above, so below; as below, so above." In geometry this axiom is illustrated by such figures as circles, squares, and equilateral triangles. The size of corresponding figures may very infinitely but their nature, general appearance, and plan of construction are identical. Circles, squares, and equilateral triangles are graphic microcosms of the macrocosmic structural ideas circle, square, and equilateral triangle, respectively.

All assignments are microcosms of the essential, or macrocosmic, idea assignment, which refers basically to the acceptance, by cognition or recognition, of that which is necessary to be done for complete fulfillment. Human life-assignments are revealed and perceived in an infinite variety of relative significance, in terms of immediate need, immediate objective, relationship-factors, ideals, etc. However, there is a two-fold equation which applies to all: degree of difficulty in fulfillment is directly proportionate to degree of needed regeneracy; degree of ease in fulfillment is directly proportionate to degree of consciously- attained equilibrium. To the degree that a human is removed from equilibrium is he removed from the consciousness of capacity to fulfill his assignments with efficiency, inspiration, and enjoyment; to the degree that he is aware of equilibrium within himself is he able to enforce or recharge his endeavors with the powers of his Spirit. The re-charging by Spirit-power brings about the revealment of equilibrium in body, mind, emotion, relationship, and endeavors. Since a human is a composite of many faculties, bodies, inclinations, abilities, and objectives it is necessary, through a given incarnation, that he or she specialize on that phase, or on those phases, of unfoldment that are most directly consistent with karmic requirements; incarnation is made by vibratory law in terms of time, place, parentage, and environment that are appropriate to the inception of self-imposed, self-assumed assignments.

Planetary aspects alone do not picture "life- assignment." Each aspect pictures an inter-relationship between basic qualities and powers of consciousness and thus portrays a mode by which assignments are to be fulfilled. The tabulation of aspects in a given chart gives a summary of how the person has used the powers of consciousness in the past, how he tends to use them in this life and how he may tend to use them in future. The fulfillment of an assignment necessitates equipment as well as objective and, in the incarnated state, environment is as inevitable and as important a factor of equipment as is consciousness. All environmental and relationship factors correspond to individual human experience as the Earth itself corresponds to the evolution of Humanity. Therefore, the co-relation of the house-position of aspects with the vibratory factors represented by the planets and signs is necessary to the evaluation of life-activities as "assignments."

Since there are twelve houses which indicate the environmental patterning for the aspects made by the ten planetary points (Sun, Moon, and planets) there will be, in every chart, some unoccupied houses. The houses symbolize the externalization of the signs, just as the planetary points represent the focalization of the signs as expressive powers. Those houses which do contain the planetary points represent the exterior patterning in terms of relationships and places of the life-activities. Part of the "over-all evolutionary assignment" of all humans is to learn to relate the self wisely to environment so that environment be rightly understood and rightly used as a "tool," but is never allowed to become a bondage to the person or an impediment to unfoldment. Each relationship and environment externalizes particular principles of consciousness and spiritual responsibility and the objective to be gained by experience in a relationship or environment is the apperception of a Truth of Life. All factors of Principle, Powers, and Externalization must be co-related for evaluation.

Since regenerative transcendence of the past is the assignment assumed by each human for each incarnation, it is a practical idea to begin your study of the planetary aspect of a chart by relative evaluation. This is done by tabulating the various types of aspects and computing the orb of each, starting with the one that is closest to ninety degrees by orb. Avoid concentrating on this aspect as being "the most evil aspect in the chart." Rather, study it from the standpoint of what it tells about the person's consciousness and tendencies: it is the pattern that indicates the greatest need for regeneration of consciousness, it indicates the point of minimum internal equilibrium and maximum tendency to resist evolution. Therefore, it pictures those experiences--or that general type of experience--in which the person will have to make his maximum internal effort to learn his spiritual and evolutionary lesson.

Your enlightening the person regarding the meaning and significance of his closest-to-exact square aspect is a paramount service, because to the degree that he understands how to handle the stimulations to the aspect will he realize power and wisdom to handle the other "less constricted" aspects in his chart. Your study of the aspect requires concentrated meditation because it is necessary for you to realize the evolutionary implications of it as representing phases of power, love, and truth yet-to-be-admitted into the person's consciousness. A square or opposition of wider orb will be activated for a relatively longer time, but the timing of the wider orb permits alleviating conditions (trines and sextiles to the natal made by transits, new Moons, etc.) to act at the same time. The timing of stimulus to a close-to-exact square focalizes and concentrates the "pain-potential" as well as the timing element. The pain we experience through stimulus of our squares is proportionate to an inherent tendency to resist evolutionary requirements. Remember always that a square aspect in a horoscope is evidence of the person's consciousness being grounded in a specialized way in this life in order to learn an urgent lesson; it is evidence of neglect of that lesson, or mis-used opportunity, in the past and it pictures the present opportunity to remedy that neglect in this life.

All manifestation is projected from ordered plan or pattern and since all human life-assignments, in degree of fulfillment, manifest evolution of consciousness and refinement of nature it is necessary to give special attention to certain other factors that have many important things to tell the reader and the subject of the chart. One of these is the Moon, symbol of the instinctual nature. The Moon-aspects and position in a chart give us the most direct clues to that which, in consciousness, is brought into this life from the past experiences. It indicates the most pronounced habit- tendencies from the past which, when emphasized in the present life, externalize chaotic conditions. The faculty of feeling-reaction (which represents an aspect of the feminine polarity of consciousness) is forever seeking to deliver to our conscious awareness those modes and qualities of thought which we have planted in it. In this way the instinctual mind is recognized to be a production mechanism and a reproduction mechanism. If, by recognition, we do not like what the instinctual mind produces through our faculty of feeling-reaction-- to events, environments, and people--then we have to change the quality of our reaction-faculty; this can be done only by improving and refining the quality of our reactions. This process makes use of the regenerative or spiritual essences of all the planetary points, and especially those which are "unregeneratively" aspected to the Moon in the natal chart. As we regenerate those "planetary essences" we plant in the instinctual mind an improved vibratory quality, more ordered and refined.

Those factors of the life-assignment which concern the Saturn-vibration are those which have as their evolutionary goal the consciousness of true security. Saturn is the principle of responsibility-fulfillment and it is only by the fulfillment of all assigned assignments and responsibilities that the form of equilibrium we identify as "security" is realized. It is very important, due to the influence which the astrologer's words and interpretations have on the client's consciousness, that a constructive philosophical-psychological understanding of Saturn be attained. Saturn is the symbol of dense form which serves as the vehicle for evolving consciousness; it is the tendency by which humans identify "security" as being a certain kind of material state--without which the human experiences what he identifies as "fear," "insecurity," and "uncertainty." If Saturn--in the cosmic sense-- symbolizes dense form, then its correspondence in evolving human consciousness is either "trouble and sorrow from having wrongly used form in the past" or "the realization of true inner security from having rightly and fulfillingly used form as a tool or vehicle of the Spirit." Saturn is the cosmic Principle of Gravity; its vibration in our consciousness tends to "bring us down to the root and essence of our as-yet-unfulfilled states" in order that our evolutionary ascent may be made thorough and complete. Some charts register Saturn in several square and opposition aspects--what some readers call "terribly afflicted charts." If there is, in truth, any "affliction" represented it is only by the indication that the person in this life needs to recapitulate a great deal from the past, redeem, and fulfill it with Love and Intelligence before he can progress. The aspects themselves are not "evil"--they are simply astrological indications of a certain kind of evolutionary need. The Spirit-ual qualities implied by the Saturn vibration are thoroughness, accuracy, patience (the use of Time as a building-substance), and concentrated devotion to right action (Saturn's sign Capricorn is the exaltation-sign of Mars, the principle of energy and action).

It is becoming increasingly evident that the life- assignments of progressively-minded, aspiring people include degrees of participation in those measures having to do with the establishment of the New Age. As a humanity, we are being synthesized in this age more than ever before in our history, and those persons who are welcoming opportunities in study, activity, work, and recreation to expand their fraternal recognition of fellow-humans are signifying their spiritual and evolutionary alignment with the principles of the New Age. This evolutionary tendency is astrologically indicated by the planet Uranus, ruler of Aquarius and planetary polarization of the Sun's sign Leo. The establishment of the New Age is an inevitable result of spiritual progression in Human-- individual or collective-- consciousness; the study and intuitive realization of the Uranus-factor in charts has become a vital portion of the astrological reader's service. Many people in this age are finding their greatest difficulties in adjusting to the rapid expansion of thought, knowledge, and understanding which is now being promulgated. The internal resistance to that which is new or as-yet-not-understood can be an indication of much residual fear, inflexibility of mind, prejudice, or tendency-to-inertia. Some people cannot seem to "forgive Life" for"shaking them up," "taking things away from them," "upsetting their routines," or "making them so uncertain" and the astrological reader is often called upon to help these persons by spiritual and philosophical enlightenment. Regeneration of consciousness is made possible only through decrystallization and redistribution of internal energies, and adjustability of mind is the key to all expanding comprehension. As a reader, you will seek to understand the Uranus-factor in a chart to help the person concerned make a better fulfillment of his this-life's assignments through clearer understanding of the great evolutionary currents now prevailing and their reason for being. Uranus acts always to shatter and decrystallize the no- longer-needed so that the fullness of progress on all planes may be revealed and realized.

Every living thing is composed of a hierarchy of parts and functions by which the organic experience of the thing is perpetuated. A human horoscope is a picture of a living consciousness, and all of its parts (signs, planetary points, houses, positions, aspects, activations by transit and progression) comprise a hierarchy of indications pertaining to the life-assignment. If one factor is to be designated as the most important in any chart or in all charts, that factor is certainly the Sun and its co-relative sign Leo. We are told that the Sun, by precession, was in Leo at the time of the inception of the present manifestation; as a planetary point the Sun represents pure creativity and pure apperception of the divine will, to which the "personal will" of the individual must eventually be brought in alignment. Therefore, any and all "separate life-assignments" are parts of a Hierarchy of evolutionary assignments, the apex of which, indicated by the Sun, is the conscious attainment of realization of divine will, love, and wisdom, conscious attainment of complete equilibrium, and conscious attainment of realized unity with divine source.

In the study of any horoscope regarding "determining the life-assignment" remember that "know thy self" is the inherent objective throughout. The Sun as a planetary factor can be squared or opposed by all other points, except Mercury and Venus; but, as a planetary factor, the Sun represents the individual's relative non-attainment or relative attainment of realized spiritual identity, purpose, and function. Aspects involving the planetary Sun indicate relative inability or ability to externalize autonomy (self-rule); in the fullest sense, and as the apex of hierarchy of evolutionary assignments, the Sun represents, by conscious alignment with and realization of the Divine, the "rule of self by self." The self of a human is his divine essence and it is by ascending degrees, through evolution, of exercising the realization of divine nature that most effectively fulfills each "life-assignment" and the life assignment.
