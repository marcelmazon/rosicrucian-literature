### <h3 id="chapter-1">Chapter I: The Point, The Line, and the Circle</h3>

For a long time it has been one of the author's most deeply-rooted personal convictions that astrology is humanity's supreme interpretative art. "Supreme" because its elements of structure and symbolism composite the structural and symbolic elements of the other arts. It is the symbolic picturing of cosmic principles "expressing humanly;" as such, it pictures everything which humanity itself seeks to express in the fine arts. It is the patterning of actions and reactions and these two words together are the macrocosm of what we call "human experience" which, in turn, is the "distillation of spiritual consciousness." Art, in whatever form, serves to intensify and vivify Man's awareness of himself, other people, and the world around him.

The fundamental simplicity of astrological symbolism has the deep-reaching effect on our consciousness that it does have because of its archetypal quality; hence its messages--through planets, signs, houses, and aspects--reach us continually as we ourselves unfold our resources of wisdom and perception. All artists, universally considered great, are considered so because of an unusually high development in at least one branch of their particular art; the great astrologer is one who has effected a harmonious integration of intellect with love and intuition. He is, by nature of his talent, an intellect and an instrument, a stimulator and a reflector, a parent and a brother. He knows darkness but his awareness is centered in Light; he serves to illuminate the consciousness of others regarding their real identity as expressions of the Law of Cause and Effect, which is cosmic polarity in action through the human archetype.

This introductory discourse on the "point, line, and circle" is for the purpose of mental preparation for consideration of the analogies between the fine arts and astrology. Any work of art is a chemicalized organization of elements, abstract and concrete, which serves to embody an archetypal idea. The conception of the idea is the action of the artist's feminine polarity; it represents his functioning as a"focus-er" of inspirational powers and as a perceptor of the archetype, by intuition. By exercise of will-power and technical skill (the masculine polarity) a vibratory fusion takes place which makes possible the gestation of the embodiment--the archetype is condensed and objectified through the particular artistic medium--the inherent perfection of the archetype is relatively manifested in tone, color, designs, movement, gesture, words, etc. The fusion of intuition with will is the exercise of bi-polarity--the artist is, at one and the same time, the "father-mother" of his work. Human beings do not and cannot--CREATE tones, colors, designs, movements, gestures, etc. We do, however, have the faculty of becoming aware of the existence and nature of archetypes, and our talents permit us to manifest our concepts of the archetypes, which are, and always have been, resident in Divine Mind. We as individuals, simply give individualized expressions of them. The transcendent quality of the work of a truly great artistic genius has its resource in the clarity with which he perceives the archetype and the efficiency with which he gives it expression. Think about this in connection with those works of art which you love most deeply and which have inspired you the most intensely. They live always in your consciousness and they serve to symbolize inner realities to you. Your response to them is part and parcel of your soul body; their essence will live in it as long as you exist. They are, in whatever form, vibratory statements of truth. The "creativity" of the artistic manifestor is the originality with which he embodies the archetype.

A few examples--to illustrate the archetypal quality of great art: The music of Johann Sebastian Bach; the singing of Marian Anderson; the dance-arts of Isadora Duncan, Vaslav Nijinsky, and Mary Wigman; the acting of Eleanora Duse and John Barrymore; the dramas of Shakespeare; the sculpture of Rodin; the novels of Pearl Buck; the architecture of ancient Egypt; the poetry of Verlaine, etc.

Without the "point, line and circle" there can be no astrological picturing. Without understanding the archetypal significance of these three we cannot understand the archetypal significance of either a work of art or a horoscope. In the composite of "point, line and circle, " as a sequence, is seen the symbol of emanation--macrocosmic and microcosmic, divine and human. Have you ever wondered what to do to create a symbol of "nothing?" Simple enough. You abide by the meaning of the word and do nothing. You leave the paper blank. The instant you have indicated anything on the paper, you have given embodiment to a " something. " The most fascinating factor in symbology is the study of the point--because the point is the start of all outpicturing. Can you draw a line"all-at-once"? No--you have to start with a point. To counter with "but I can use a stamp and draw the line all at once" is equivocation; the stamp (made to draw a line) was itself made by process.

People--most people--are inclined to think that a zero (circle) is the symbol for "nothing." The mere fact that a zero is a "drawn thing" automatically invalidates such an interpretation. ("One and zero"--as a drawing--is not "one" but "ten.") Let us consider the nature of a "zero-circle" from the standpoint of how it is essentially made; from that, perhaps, we can attain a clearer perception of what it essentially symbolizes. (Note that, in addition and multiplication, our "numerical results" emanate to the left--just as the Ascendant-line "emanates" from the center of the Great Mandala in specific time-space. The number farthest to the left in the arithmetical result is analogous to the Ascendant-point.)

The instant your pencil-point touches the paper you have established the point. By sequence of movement in time-space, you draw the line from that point. The point, then, is the source of the line, as far as representation is concerned. Polarity is represented here: your will and mind impose themselves on the material substances of the pencil and paper; the thought of drawing the line is your subjective action; the drawing is the objective action which results in the manifestation of the line. Of the two instruments, the pencil is masculine because its substance is qualified to make the mark; the paper is feminine because its nature is to "receive" the impress of the pencil-point and reflect back the picturing of your idea. By correspondence, you are (in this action) God; the pencil and paper are matter and the line is the specific result of the action of your will on the material substance; by correspondence again--just as Father-Mother God (creative Will and Imagination) utilizes the material universe to manifest archetypes--and those archetypes might be "humanity, ""cat," "oak tree," or "humming bird" (human, quadruped, vegetable, or bird). The action of the pencil-point on the paper is analogous to the action of cosmic polarity on and through the material universe. resulting in a specialized manifestation.

Just as you, as an "emanation" of Father-Mother God, are the source of your expressions, so the point you have drawn is the source of all lines, planes and (theoretically) solids which can, or might, emanate from it. As such, it is the abstract symbol of infinite subjectivity; from that point lines can be drawn in infinite space and infinite time. Because the line "lives" is evidence that the point exists; because we are sustained in manifestation is evidence that our source exists. The line, then, is specific effect from a specific cause; the drawing of it is a chemicalizing process; the measurement of it is the exercise of your will to manifest perfectly the archetype in your mind. (An indefinite line is unfulfilled manifestation of the archetype; a measured line is specifically, definitely qualified as an archetypal outpicturing. ) Actually the point is a "filled-in dot;" abstractly, and we are now dealing with abstractions, it symbolizes the pure composite of all dimensions. Give the word "archetype" a great deal of thought--it could be made the subject of a life-time study for it is one of the most fascinating and illuminating of words.

The point is now seen to be--as an abstract symbol--the archetype of source: God, cause, subjective essence, nucleus, seed, etc. The line, correspondingly, is the first emanation of the potential- -source because no other line was, as yet, drawn from the point. When the line is completed by specific measurement it is fully "chemicalized" and it is qualified, by its attributes of fineness" to emanate planes and solids.(just as a child, "emanated" by his parents, possesses the attributes of becoming a parent himself when he matures; his maturity, of body and emotion, qualifies him for a specific identity--parenthood--as the measurement of the line specifically qualifies it.

Applying to the subject of this discourse, the point is the archetypal idea of the artist. The drawing of the line is the action of manifesting the archetype. The measured line, complete, is the finished work now qualified by its attributes to be seen heard, and enjoyed-- responded to. In the Great Astrological Mandala the center-point is the inherent Divinity of the archetype humanity; the line drawn to the left is the abstract ascendant, Aries, the "I AM" of all human-beings. In the horoscope of the individual human the central point is his "God-spark," his individualized "portion" of Divinity, the chemicalization of which is the line drawn horizontally to the left from the point; its contact with the circumference of the circle is his physical birth--the objectification of his "I AM. " Since there is only one radius of any circle, this "Ascendant-line" is the composite of the human's four basic identities: male and/or female; complementation (and these two comprise the sexual identity); masculine and feminine gender (these two comprise the identities of being Causers and Effects of Causes or Expressors and Reactors).

The word "Art" corresponds to the word "Artist " as the word, " Humanity " corresponds to the composite word " Man-Woman. " There are many forms of Art--expression just as there are various types of human beings. Art, as an archetypal word, means: the manifestation of archetypes through the media of tone, color, substance, word, and movement and the abstract elements of design and rhythm."Humanity" means: manifestation, on this planet, of an archetypal idea of Father-Mother God; it is expressed through the two media of male and female sex appearing in the "evolutionary dimensions" of unfulfillment and relative fulfillment of Divine potentials. Now, the emanations of the line--as, in itself, a "source":

Just as the Archetypal number is "one," so there is only one center to any horoscope and one radius--though, consequently, two diameters. The artist possesses--manifestively and/or interpretatively--one artistic endowment and that is his ability to perceive archetypes and to manifest them. But there may be many ways by which he can exercise his artistic "I AM"--both by participation in different art-forms or in different phases of one particular form There are in astrology three expressions of the four basic identities which were previously mentioned. In each of these twelve identities, the human expresses his specialized potentials; in each of the phases of the artist 's endowment (the genders of which, masculine and feminine, are manifestor and interpreter, respectively) he expresses his specialized artistic potentials; the playwright expresses through various dramatic forms and the actress learns to interpret various types of roles; the musician deals, or can deal, with different instruments and musical forms; the architect and the sculptor learn to adapt different substances to give embodiment to their ideas. The artist fulfills the " radii of the wheel "with each satisfactory demonstration of his manifestive and/or interpretative endowment; the human individual fulfills "his radii" when he becomes aware of the spiritual principles involved in his experience-patterns and expresses that realization in his daily living. How is the "end" of all this symbolized? Let us consider the fulfillment of the point--the circle:

The ineffable beauty of a perfect circle is man- kind's supreme symbol of spiritual realization and perfect fulfillment of potentials. Subsequent to realization and potential-fulfillment comes perfect releasement, in perfect timing, from bondage to form. "Form" can mean a specific relationship, a specific experience-pattern on a particular octave, a specific state of manifestation, or a specific evolutionary cycle. To illustrate:

On a paper draw the next simplest geometric form- -an equilateral triangle. The mid-points of the sides are the three points that are closest to the center (of the figure). As you move along the triangle from anyone of these three points you recede from the center until you come to the next angle-point. Do the same with the square--the mid-points of its sides are the four points closest to the center and the angle-points are most removed from the center. All three-or-more-sided enclosed figures are crystal symbols--they represent static states. Movement around them, though rhythmic in equilateral figures is not constant in relationship to the center. In this respect, the circle differs from all other enclosed figures. Trace your pencil-point from any place on the circumference of a perfect circle around the wheel and back to the starting-place: your pencil-point was the same distance from the center at all times. Hence, the "spiritual perfection" of the circle and its esthetic perfection (a continuous, perfectly controlled, "flow" from a given point) represents the ideal of rhythmic, harmonious expression of potentials and their perfect fulfillments in Love-Wisdom.

Since the equilateral triangle--the " Grand Trine"--is the next most significant as a spiritual symbol (because of the "closeness" of its mid-points to the center) we have, in it, the picture of the relative perfection of the human being exercising, from time to time, the highest and best of his attributes. He doesn't--being human--stay at those high points (those closest to the center--and they have an analogy to the mid- points of a horoscopical diameter); he tends to recede from his Center toward the next angle-point--which symbolizes a new identity for further releasements of Love-Wisdom powers. Study the four generic trines, each one enclosed in a circle, with the mid-points of the sides connected to the center--to picture the "closeness." The angle-points, being furthest from the center, are in each of the four symbols, the triune power of identity (cardinal) to be expressed and fulfilled through love (fixed) and wisdom (mutable). The enclosing of a smaller circle by the three mid-points represents the"returning" of individualization (Adam-and-Eve) to unity (Paradise) by redemption through Love-Wisdom (the Christos). Continuing this process of creating smaller circles in the same way would eventually, from an abstract symbolic standpoint, reduce the original circle to its original Center-point, the conclusions of the experience of a manifested archetype: "from "Subjectivity through Objectivity and back to Subjectivity." To conclude:

The circle is not a "chemical symbol." it is manifestation of the inherent perfection of a chemicalized expression. It is the ideal of perfect objectification and of perfect realization. It is the infinity of perfect effect as the center-point is the infinite perfection of the archetype. The circle of the horoscopical wheel is the human archetype to be manifested (Mastership); it is the truth, the goodness, and the BEAUTY-- the inspirational power--of the fulfilled work of art. It is the refined and sensitized consciousness of the artist as manifestor--interpreter--and " interpreter " means "teacher" as well as "performer"--and the fulfillment of his sacred endowment as a spiritual instrument. The circle's center-point is the divine source of manifestation--on all planes, octaves, and cycles. 

### <h3 id="chapter-2">Chapter II: Spectrum</h3>

"Spectrum" is one of the most important archetypal words involved in a study of art-expressions; the word, in archetypal or concrete application, is derived from a Latin word meaning "to look at." "Emanation" is the process by which the potentials of a thing are made manifest; "spectrum" is the result--the total of PERCEPTIBLE potentials, qualities and parts. We usually use the word "spectrum" to designate that appearance of a ray of light that has been refracted into its component colors (parts) and this is an excellent example for the purposes of this study because astrology is, itself, perceived visually. The rainbow is a perfect concrete example. It is a natural spectrum; but it is more than that--it is a perfect symbol of "spectrum" as an archetypal--word. The ray of sunlight is macrocosm, the rainbow is microcosm; the rainbow as a spectrum is macrocosm to each of its designable colors, its "microcosms;" "Spectrum," as an archetypal word, applies to each of the colors as "macrocosm" to each of its shades or gradations or qualities. In other words it is the "offspring" of luminosity and refraction; its basic characteristics are "designable colors ;"they, in turn, are qualified by gradations and shadings which can also be designated by specific words.

As far as our solar system is concerned, the original spectrum is in the creative imaginations of Father-Mother God. The Divine Mind, since it is the Source of each archetype (ex: rainbow) manifested in this system, is the source of all "manifestation-spectrums" (ex: all kinds of rainbows) and all spectrums-of-manifestation of each manifested archetype (ex: the total and separate colors, and their gradations, of each rainbow). By analogy, then, Divine Mind corresponds to the ray of sunlight in our illustration; one archetype is rainbow (a manifestation of Light); a sub- archetype is one of the designable colors resident in the rainbow.

The archetypal manifestation of Divine Mind (the creative imagination of Father-Mother God) is perceived to be our own solar system. The "spectrum of emanation" would be the gradation of the planets from the time the first one was emanated until the last one was emanated. The spectrum of its occult qualities would be the evolutionary gradation of the Planetary Logoi of the system analogous to the differentiated colors of the rainbow. Color has a spectrum of vibratory rate (specific shades) and also a spectrum of vibratory quality (relative radiance or dullness). The vibratory quality-spectrum of the entire solar system would be the sum total gradation of all inhabitants of this system in terms of "most-to-least" (or "least-to- most") exercises of spiritualized consciousness. The same classification would designate vibratory quality-spectrum of the inhabitants of any one particular planet and, in turn, their grouping by race and/or nation. This analogy is also applicable to the archetype tone--the essential material of the musical manifestor and interpreter.

Tone is the archetype of all sound since, by its nature, it is rhythmic vibration perceived audibly. "Fraternal" with color, tone has a two-fold spectrum: vibratory rate (low and high) and vibratory quality; the spectrum of tonal vibratory quality is also twofold: that of Dynamic (softness and loudness) and Power (dullness and brilliance). The spectrum of "tonal rate" is the entire manifestation of the tonal scale from the slowest vibratory speed (lowest) to the fastest (highest). This "total scale"is divided into "octaves" as the rainbow is divided into "colors." (Colors are simply the "octaves" in a light-ray. ) As each rainbow-color is, in itself, a "spectrum of shades" so each tonal octave is a "spectrum." Every perceptible and designable shade of a specific color, the sum total of which is the "matrix"of the specific color, is analogous to each overtone of the musical note, the overtones of a specific musical note in composite, are the "matrix" of the note just as the etheric envelope of human, animal, plant, or mineral is its matrix. The tone, in relationship to its overtones, is "condensed vibratory embodiment' '--a specific factor of a musical system.

The dynamic spectrum of color is its gradation from white to utmost density; the dynamic spectrum of tone is the gradation representing "softness-loudness." The power spectrum of both color and tone is the gradation from "least impinging power" (dullness) to "maximum impinging power" (brilliance of carrying-quality). A great pianist, by a controlling action of hand, wrist, or finger on the complete depression of the key, can create a "pianissimo" of delicate softness whose power will carry to the far corners of the audience-room. Others, less skilled, can play as loudly as possible and the tones they bring forth will sound hard or lifeless. The analogy of this to the Astrologer's "dullness" or "brilliance" in interpreting principles as they are pictured in a horoscope is one of the things to which you should give considerable thought; the analogy if exact.

The manifestive artist uses a spectrum of media for his expressions. This spectrum ranges from the most concrete abstract medium (design) to the most evanescent abstract medium-rhythm. It also includes the three concrete media: tone, color and substance Line is the abstract medium between design and rhythm. Line is the archetype-symbol of "process of manifestation." The drawing of a line can be "spaced" (rhythmitized) and from line all embodied (enclosed) forms (designs) are derived; just as the line itself was emanated from its source, the point.

Letter and word; tone and chord; line and design (two-dimensional embodiment) and mass (three-dimensional design) composite the artist's means of outpicturing his concepts of archetypes, whether manifestively or interpretatively. Rhythm, the spacing of sequence, or of sequential manifestation, is a "common denominator" of all art forms because rhythm is the archetype of the nature of all movement.

The analogy of "spectrum in Astrology" to "spectrum in the arts" is fascinating because of its clarity. The archetypal resource of both forms of interpretation is human consciousness; the archetypal purpose of both is to interpret the nature of divine archetypes through manifested concepts of those archetypes the archetypal action of both is to intensify, vivify, and illuminate man's awareness of himself, other people and the world around him; the archetypal reaction to both is from the composite of man's instinctual feeling and instinctual knowing.

The word "artist" is archetypal; its two principle "emanations" are manifestive (creative) artist and interpretative artist. The first human being who moved or posed his body in a certain way to give expression to a specific emotional state was the "first" manifestive dancer. The first human being who recognized that "the point, the line and the circle" could he utilized to symbolize the being, the consciousness, and the existence of humanity--or of a human being-was the "first" manifestive astrologer. (It might be observed at this point, that the "point, line, and circle" are the archetypal "ingredients" of the planetary symbols as well as of the structure- design of the wheel.) The manifestive astrologer-like the manifestive artist-- embodies his concept of an archetype by an originally--conceived symbol; the symbol is his way of outpicturing the nature, purpose, and objectification of a cosmic principle. The interpretative astrologer studies and intuitively perceives the meanings of already manifested symbols; he fulfills his function by applying his understanding of these symbols to the interpretation of the horoscope. (For example, the author suggests consideration of the following as a "manifestive" symbol for the planet Pluto: a circle enclosing the up- pointing arrow used in the symbol for Mars; the arrow is the energy- expression-potential; the circle is the collective subconscious of humanity- the archetypal desire-power as a "frozen fluid" waiting releasement through expression; it is the author's concept of the meaning of Scorpio's rulership by Pluto and co-rulership by Mars. (The letter P in an initial).

The archetypal word spectrum has polarity. The masculine polarity is "spectrum of vibratory quality:" the feminine polarity is the "spectrum of manifested forms" which is the crystallization of archetypal design. These two polarities of spectrum are seen in astrology this way: the masculine polarity (subjectivity) is the entire "vibratory spread" of the twelve zodiacal signs, from the first second of Aries to the last second of Pisces. This is the spectrum of consciousness, humanly speaking; it is the spectrum of cosmic powers, divinely speaking. From the standpoint of polarity as it is manifested in the attributes of human nature, it is the spectrum of generic quality--the composite of "activeness" and "reactiveness" of which every human, male or female, partakes. It composites the essence of our projectiveness and reflectiveness, our expression and our perception. Since "polarity" is a composite, we recognize that this "masculine-subjective" aspect of the wheel is a "spread of points," any one of which is a potential by which we express according to our perceptions, and we perceive according to our capacity to express. Expression is the process by which individuality is manifested; perception is polarity experienced. These actions occur in time-sequence, but their source is a unity-consciousness.

The "negative" or "feminine" objective polarity of astrological spectrum is the sequence of the twelve houses, through the twelfth-counterclockwise from the first. These depict specific experience- designations in which, and through which, consciousness is both expressed and perceived. They refer to the"objectivity" of Life. Each house is a "mechanism"for focalizing (as "parentage" focalizes the identity of a small child) the expressions of our perceptions of specific life-principles. Each house is a sub-archetype of the archetype-word "matrix;" it nurtures our experience and growth as the maternal body nurtures the gestation of the child internally and the father's power nurtures the welfare of both mother and child externally. So these twelve experience-patterns "parent" our spiritual unfoldments in time-space. In congestion (unregenerate expression of crystallized perception) we remain "bound" to the experience-matrix; through regenerated expression of decrystallized perceptions, we gain dominion over environment just as, with maturity, we gain "dominion" over our dependencies upon our bi-polar matrix: father and mother. Thus we enable ourselves to function more and more with individualized awareness of principles rather than in repetitious conformity to the limitation of appearances. Remember that this"spectrum of houses" is one polarity of the archetype human experience; therefore no part of it is "bad"or "evil." The houses, in composite, are materials to be used; they are designations of which we must learn the principle--just as the study of colors helps us to understand the nature of light.

The planets are focalizers of the signs which they rule; they are specifically placed, by the Law of Cause and Effect, in the two representations of the astrological spectrum-sign and house. Just as each color has its own gradations and each tone has its oven overtones, so each planet has a "personal spectrum" of a two-fold nature. One is the "pattern-spectrum"--all possible aspects with all other planets; the other is the "focus-spectrum"--all possible placements in signs and houses as specifications of the significant generic "points" in the individual horoscope. An unaspected planet is like a "dull" tone in music--it has little "carrying power." A congestion of a planet 's relationship to another is like any technical problem in any art--the person has to "learn the principles" involved just as the artist has to overcome his ignorance or his inadequacies in order more perfectly to manifest or interpret his concepts of archetypes. The artist's "overcoming his problem" is analogous to the person with the congested aspect becoming aware of the principles involved in his particular experience-pattern and going into action from the basis of extended consciousness.

The arch-spectrum of "astrological pattern" is two-fold: the sub-spectrum of the three-fold square (cardinal, fixed, and mutable) and the sub-spectrum of the four-fold generic trine (fire, earth, air and water). The three-fold square, in four variations, is the arch-symbol of: the attribute of Father-Mother God to take form. The four-fold trine in three variations, is arch-symbol of: the divine potential inherent in every form (manifestation or identity). The conjunction of two planets is really the archetypal symbol of marriage; two planets are "fused" for the start of an entire series of aspect-relationships to each other during the ensuing many incarnations. (Just as in marriage two individual persons are "fused" for a series of mutual relationships during the ensuing years. Think about this.) In other words, the conjunct-aspect is analogous to the central point of the circle because the central point "emanates" the potentials to the Ascendant; the conjunction-aspect is going to emanate a series of planetary aspects as the person progresses through his succeeding incarnations.

All planetary aspects have "spectrum" in this way: by the significance of "orb" two planets have exact aspect to each other, they have approximate aspect to each other, or they have no aspect to each other. This is the spectrum of "aspect-exactitude"--the exactness of an aspect determines the intensity of its effects, congestively or expressively The square aspect has polarity in the sense that it, in itself, symbolizes archetypally congestion of (masculine) expression or congestion of (feminine) perception. The square, the sextile (alchemy, dynamic regeneration) the conjunction (fusion of powers), and the opposition (planetary focalization of a diameter) have spectrum only in the sense that any signs, houses, or planets can appear in these patterns. The trine-symbol has the two-fold spectrum of polarity:

We use the equilateral triangle resting on its horizontal base (the three earth-signs of the Great Mandala) as the symbol for "trine-aspect." Because the earth-signs are used, and because this is the most static representation of the trine, this is really the feminine polarity of the trine; it is the result of having exercised relative love-wisdom in the past, and this is another way of saying "relative Mastership." The person with a trine aspect enjoys a certain harmony, or abundance, or integration in this incarnation because of his efforts in the past. The masculine polarity of the trine is the fire-trine of Aries-Leo-Sagittarius. This is the dynamic exercise of spiritualized consciousness and it is the higher octave of the sextile aspect. Because cause and effect have the same source, we can see that this two-fold representation of tile polarity of the trine tells us: "Yes, enjoy the fruits of this aspect but remember that you are evolving; you must also use the trine as a dynamic power to raise the quality of your relative Mastership for greater perceptions in the future.

Your horoscope will take on an added "glow"and "radiance" if you will think of it in terms of spectrum just as your appreciation of art takes on depth to the degree that you become aware of the values and beauties of its several attributes and essences. "See" the four generic trines unfold from the cardinal, fixed, and mutable structure points; "see" the chemicalization of spirit into objectification by unfolding the four structure-crosses from the three fire, earth, air, and water signs. Think spectrum regarding everything that comes to your attention -- archetypes, sub- archetypes, and so forth -- for a while. You will unfold, at the same time, a remarkable scope of perceiving the values of planetary positions and patterning To "think spectrum"is to think archetypically. To "think archetypically" is to exercise the mind rhythmically. 

### <h3 id="chapter-3">Chapter III: Rhythm</h3>

In this study of Rhythm we are attempting to comprehend the nature and essence of the most intangible and evanescent attribute of cosmic manifestation. We will discuss this subject from as archetypal a standpoint as possible; it is necessary to do so if we are to perceive the meaning of this attribute to the essentials of the arts.

Movement is the archetypal word which means the action of cosmic alchemy. The manifestations of the universe are continually in a state of change from one form, degree, size, quality, volume, cycle, and octave to another. No manifestated thing stays exactly the same from year to year--or even from day to day. Everything responds to the dynamic essence of evolutionary forces toward the end that inherent potentials will be released and fulfilled. Your body grows in size and in capacity-to-express or it deteriorates and lessens in capacity; whatever the direction, you, in your vehicle, move from one state to another. Your consciousness "moves" from one state to another and this movement is directly dependent on two things: (1) your reaction to a specific experience and (2) your succeeding action on the stimulator of your reaction. When your repetition of a negative reaction is carried into expression by corresponding action, you set up another negative cause and you move backward. This is so because experience-patterns manifest in sequence; if you fail to learn from the previous effect of a specific cause and put the ignorance into action again, your "lifeline" retrogresses instead of progresses. A repetition of a negative reaction which is counteracted by constructive action from the exercise of intelligence moves your evolutionary direction forward and upward. Think about this in terms of your movement in consciousness through your incarnation. The complete freedom to move forward from a specific aspect of a specific experience-pattern means that you have learned to apply the principle inherent in the experience-pattern in terms of your cycle-status.

Rhythm is the cosmic law of cause and effect working through movement. In rhythm, all effects occur in natural timing. By rhythm, every specific emanation is "born" at the time that is consistent with its attributes.

The reference to "Cosmic Alchemy" is applicable to the human body in this way: breathing is the inhalation that makes oxidation possible; the exhalation is the casting out of the un-needed residue. The heart-beat makes it possible for the body to inhale in order to feed and refresh the tissues of the body by the arterial action; the venous action is the withdrawing of that which is not needed. These two actions of the body, in addition to the "inhalation" of foodstuffs and the "exhalation" of wastes, are the primary illustrations of rhythmic action in the alchemicalization of the body. Though the body is timed for the fulfillment of its needs, we eat and drink according to conscious action; the breath and heart-beat are directed by the subconscious--they "go on" automatically. Think a bit about the natural rhythms of your physical life-alchemy is the purpose which is being fulfilled by these timed processes. Mankind has other ways of being alerted to the rhythms of the universe. Let us consider a few examples of the evidences of rhythm in the natural world:

That metrical indication in music which we call "two four" rhythm--two full counts to each measure (one-and-two-and) not only illustrates the polarity of time but it is the archetype of all rhythmic action. Count one is male-masculine, the "and" is the feminine completion of the count; count two is female-masculine, its "and" is the feminine completion. (The masculine-feminine of male-female is cosmic polarity in four- fold expression-the Universal "Adam-and-Eve. ") Now-

BREATHING: count one is the beginning of the inhalation; "and" is the completion of the inhalation; count two is the beginning of the exhalation; its "and" is the completion of the exhalation.

WAVES: count one-the "inhalation"--is the "gathering of water-forces" as they recede from the shore; "and" is the forward surge to the apex of the wave; count two is the down-crashing of the wave: "and" is the farthest point reached by the forward-action of the wave on the shore. This illustrates the wave's "breathing," but the music of the wave is counted by the "pulse" of its sound; count one is the down-beat--the loud crashing sound; "and" is the forward surge to the highest point on the shore; count two is the "ingathering noise;" its "and" is the forward surge to the apex of the wave. The noise of the "crash" is analogous to the down-beat of count one in the musical measure, the heaviest" accent. "

DAYS: the spectrum of the days of a year has rhythmic polarity in several ways. One is the polarity of day-time (conscious existence) and night-time (subconscious existence). Count one is sunrise; its "and" is noon; count two is sunset; its "and" is midnight. Seasonally, the spring equinox--Aries is analogous to sunrise; Cancer, to noon; Libra, to sunset; and Capricorn, to midnight. (This analogy does not refer to the Great Mandala, which has Cancer at the midnight-point and Capricorn at the noon- point; it is an analogy of the powers of sunlight during each day to its occult significance during the sequences in the year.)

LIFE-CYCLE: a perfect illustration of "two-four" rhythm; count one is birth; "and" is adolescence; count two is maturity; "and" is transition. This "process" is, of course, a cosmic pattern; it is the action of Life manifesting Itself.

HUMAN LOVE: count one is mutual love-recognition; "and" is generation; count two is fulfillment of assumed responsibilities; "and" is realization of principles involved in the experience (fulfillment of Relationship).

EDUCATION: count one is the action which initiates a study-experience; "and" is the process of learning; count two is the action of applying that which has been intellectually learned; "and" is learning through work and/or through applying what was learned intellectually. If two-four is the rhythmic archetype of time measurement, three-four is the basic sub-archetype. Two-four and three-four are the metrical indications from which all other meters are derived. Two-four rhythm is symbolized in astrology by the archetypal symbol of the cross, four each of cardinal, fixed, and mutable signs. The cross is alchemicalization of consciousness through reaction to (or interpretation of)incarnated experience. Three-four rhythm is symbolized by the archetypal symbol of the trine which is the inherent spiritual potential; this potential is released and expressed by the sextile onto--and into--the square, which is the cross congested. The six radii--three diameters--of the sextile symbol representing the six fire and air signs, pictures the cardinal, fixed, and mutable of these masculine signs, the male of which is fire, the female is air. The sextile then, is "two 3's"; each one of these 3's, in enclosed form, is the equilateral triangle, half of the double grand trine, the power-love-wisdom of the individualized male or female. The four points of the archetypal Cross are the basic human relationships: male and female as "giver," male and female as "taker;" or male and female as "initiators of causes,"and male and female as "reactors to the effects of causes." This great symbol pictures the identities of inter-action and inter-exchange of all human beings with each other. The (enclosed) trine is potential for individualized spiritual radiation; this potential is the "fruitage" of that which was "fermented" by the cross congested through fear- ignorance, decrystallized by the counter-actives of the sextile and resulting in the pure residue of spiritual power, love and wisdom. The trine is "that which the soul has kept after the inhalation of experience and the decrystallization of congestions has been fulfilled. "Think of the analogy between the physical body and the soul body--each "inhales and feeds" "alchemicalizes, casts off what is not needed, and retains the essences of what it requires."

The occult significance of the trine has much to say regarding the mystical healing power of three-four rhythm. Astrology illustrates this in the sequence of the cardinal-fixed-mutable signs. Each sign "enfolds" three decanates and each element "enfolds " three signs. The generic-element trines are cosmic three-four rhythm expressing from the four basic identities; this illustrates the "enfoldment"of the horoscopical wheel as divinity enfolds the universe. Therefore, three-four rhythm conveys to our instinctual knowing the reminder of the eternal Presence of the Divine. There is a subtle, almost indescribable, grace and charm in three-four rhythm that two-four and four-four do not have. The occult significance of the latter two is structural; even in three-four rhythm, phrases are basically constructed in groups of two or four measures, thus carrying out the affiliation of trine with cross. In music therapy, three-four rhythm has been proved to possess a greater power for soothing and quieting. Three-four rhythm, in the archetypal structure of four-measure phrases. is divine power in manifestation.

When we apply the occult significanees of rhythm to astrology-in-action we see remarkable things. The basic breathing of vibratory action is the down-beat and the up-beat of the lunation and its Full Moon. This action is analogous to the inhalation-exhalation of air by the human-being; it is the vibratory alchemicalization on the entire archetypal body, humanity, as oxidation and eating are the composite of individual physical alchemical processes. According to our consciousness, our bodies "move" harmoniously or otherwise with the actions of sustenance. Correspondingly, our souls develop (move) with our responses to the action of vibration. An extension of "lunation-breathing" is seen in the study of solar eclipse, which is macrocosm to the microcosmic lunation. A solar-eclipse- pattern is the stimulation of two signs of a zodiacal diameter by two eclipses which are six months (six signs) apart. Such a pattern covers one year; a solar-eclipse-cycle (stimulation twice of the two signs of a zodiacal diameter) covers a period of two years and is remarkably analogous to a complete composition of music--in three-four rhythm.

Count one is the first eclipse; counts two and three of that first "measure" are the succeeding two lunations; count one of the second measure is the "mid-point" lunation which squares the eclipse; counts two and three are the lunations which succeed the "mid-point;" count one of the third measure is the next eclipse; the five lunations which follow it repeat the sequence of the first two measures: the total of the two eclipses and their ten lunations comprises a "pattern;" the "cycle" is completed by thenext two eclipses and their ten lunationsw makinga complete vibratory composition; the Full Moon of the fourth eclipse of a cycle will fall approximately conjunct the first eclipse. To sum up: a cycle of two stimulations of two signs of a zodiacal diameter; each eclipse having its "mid-point lunation;" this is analogous to, in music, twenty-four measures in three-four rhythm-two eight-measure-phrases, four four-measure-phrases. The "and" of each "separate count" is, of course, the Full Moon of each eclipse or lunation.

Example: eclipse Scorpio 20, November, 1947; mid- point lunation Aquarius 20, February, 1948; eclipse Taurus 19, May, 1948, mid- point Leo 13, August, 1946. Lunations in Virgo and Libra, September and October, 1948, complete the "pattern," first half of the Scorpio-Taurus "cycle." Eclipse Scorpio 9, November, 1948, mid-point lunation Aquarius 9, February, 1949; eclipse Taurus 9, May,1949, followed by five lunations to the eclipse in Libra (Taurus-Libra ruled by Venus--stimulus of one planetary vibration), October, 1949, which was followed by five lunations to the eclipse in Pisces 28, in March,1950, which, in turn, inaugurated another "cycle of vibratory music" entitled "Pisces-Virgo;" this one will carry over into 1952-- two eclipses in Pisces, two in Virgo with their mid-point lunations. How did you react to your chart-stimulations under the Scorpio-Taurus cycle? How are you preparing to meet the conditions represented in your chart by the four eclipses in Pisces-Virgo? Now (August, 1950) we are just finishing the first half of the first pattern of this cycle; the second pattern will be initiated on September 12 by the eclipse in Virgo 19. How are you playing your "music?" Practicing hard?

In conclusion, a few remarks about rhythm as it applies to the other arts. Music and dance are the two arts in which the attribute of rhythm is most obviously and concretely manifested. Music is the perception of archetypes by intuitive audition and the manifestation of this perception in tonal contrivances. Dance is the alchemicalization of archetypal bodily postures through rhythm, as manifestation of archetype- perception; it is painting (or drawing) and sculpture "mobilized;" it is sequence of which sculpture is a "frozen point." Painting is manifested, basically, by lines. We recognize that the line-work which co-ordinates the basic theme of a picture to its secondary factors is rhythm out-pictured because line, in a drawing or painting, is emanation of structure-points--just as it is in astrology. The theme of a picture is, of course, the archetype which the artist seeks to manifest. Objectively, however,the "down-beat" of a picture is the focal point of the interpretative expression. The "rhythmic movement" in a painting is in the gradation of line-directions and the gradation of color-sharings. Sequence (movement) of inter-related harmonies of design and vibration composite the essence of "rhythm-in-painting." Dramatic art has rhythm in the timing of line-reading, exits and entrances (movements "into-and out-of"), actions on the stage, and the proportionate time-element in the inter-relationship of scenes (of each act) to each other and of the acts to each other.Sculpture and architecture have rhythm in pretty much the same way that painting and drawing have; except that harmony of mass- relationship, rather than that of color-relationship, is the important factor.

The beautiful illustrations of rhythm in astrology are seen in the "spacing" of the twelve house-cusps and their grouping in sequences of quadrants and semi-circles; the "two-four" of alternate signs and of opposite signs--also of the lunation and Full Moon pattern; the "three-four" of cusps in each quadrant and of signs in each trine; the "four-four" of the points of each cross and the great action- pattern of "conjunction, square, opposition, square" of the progressed Moon and transiting planets.

There is the "dance" of the Sun each year, and of the Moon every twenty-eight days, and of each of the planets in its own "tempo" through the zodiac; the mighty "beats" of day-and-night, of zodiacal diameter and of planetary dignity--and--detriment.

Mighty Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto conduct the inflow of great vibratory life-waves of humans incarnating under the entrance into--and passage through--the zodiacal signs and their decanates by the rhythmic alchemy of these Master Powers.

There is of course your own rhythmic entrance into each basic experience-pattern during your incarnation; the "spacing" of the aspects in your natal chart as they are rhythmically activated from your birth-time.

Open your eyes and your awareness more than ever before to the harmonious rhythmic significance of astrological symbology; it is, in specialized form, the picturing of the beauty of patterned cosmic polarity in action. 

### <h3 id="chapter-4">Chapter IV: Design</h3>

In the first article of this series, we discussed the point, the line and the circle as the three foundations of symbolic art. The point is infinite subjectivity; by correspondence it can be the unknowable, it can be Father-Mother God, it can be the potential of God-hood of the individual human being. The horizontal line to the left, from the point, is the process of chemicalization of the potentials of the point. The end of the line symbolizes the state of utmost chemicality corresponding to the utmost density of matter in the Universe, our solar system or the total physical body of the human, the sum total of his manifested potentials. The circle is the symbol of the infinite perfection of objectivity. Remember that the horizontal line has polarity; its ends are two points from which emanation can be made. In the astrological symbol, the first Point (the Center) initiates emanation by the process of chemicalization; the second point (the left extreme of the line) initiates emanation by process of fulfilling the potentials of the center. The drawing of the horizontal line to the left from the center symbolizes involution; the drawing of the circle, using that line as radius, symbolizes evolution; a completed circle symbolizes the inherent perfections of all potentials of the central point in fulfilled manifestations; it symbolizes the essence of ideality which man seeks to realize in all of his evolutionary experiences; the circle, in its perfect beauty, symbolizes the fulfilled manifestation of an archetype--in the case of our subject, that archetype is humanity. These three symbols are (as symbols) archetypes; from them all other archetypal symbols are derived.

Design is the cosmic Law of Order applied to the shape and structure of manifestations. Shape is the external appearance, the condensation of the form of the matrix; Structure is the interrelationships of etheric and physical parts and factors of a manifestation. Structure is the total result of the emanations from the matrix-center and shape is that which is visually perceived of structure.

All factors of a manifestation are designed because each factor is significant to the purposes of the total manifestation. In other words, the design of all parts is in accordance with the laws of the essential nature of the manifestation; the design of the completed manifestation is the objectified external appearance of the subjective archetype. Think about the "design of parts" and "external design" of mammal (human being, horse, whale--"mammal" being an archetype). In which ways are their internal and external designs similar? Think of quadruped (leopard, beaver, antelope, yak); bird (eagle, duck. ostrich, humming-bird); reptile, insect, fish, etc. consider the tremendous significance of design in the natural world. Flowers are a fine subject for this kind of study because the beauty of their design includes that of shape, color, and fragrance; the fragrance of the flower is as much a part of its design as are its shape and color. All animal life has a design in its timing for reproduction and gestation; human life has designs of relationship and work-activities, intellectual development, and spiritual illuminations. Enjoy yourself thinking about the manifold designings by which life expresses its powers.

Because our principle subject of study is astrology, by a pictorial (graphic) art, we will confine our observations concerning design to those analogies between astrology and the art of painting which has, as its abstraction, the art of line-drawing. Design is everywhere evident in the arts music, dance, poetry, drama, etc.--but we must, for conciseness, confine ourselves to these two arts, which most directly correspond to astrology.

If we can imagine ourselves exercising the faculty of sight for the first time and being totally unaware of the identifications and purposes of material things on this planet we would see, as far as our awareness would be concerned patches of color. We "see three-dimensionally" only because we have exercised sight for many incarnations, and except for the brief period in infancy when we are reorienting ourselves to this plane, we are accustomed to perspective. But, hypothetically for the moment, being totally unaccustomed to perspective we would see everything in terms of two- dimensionality. Looking into your room you see what you recognize as "large or small" of glass, cloth, wood, etc. Forgetting identity and perspective, the only "substance" you see is color manifested by the designed shapes of the things you perceive. Color is inherent in substance, but the design of substance shapes the color, or colors.

Now--design in astrology--and a beautiful subject it is!

As a factor in the pictorial essence of astrological symbolism, the circle of the astrological mandala is the framework for that which the astrologer studies. Remember that the frame-work of our visual perceptions is the circular extent of our eyes' scope of action. We do not see through a square or rectangular frame--the design of our eyes makes it possible for us to see everything through a circle.

"Seeing" is done in two ways--or in two "octaves." One is "physical seeing"--perception of physical things by exercise of a physical faculty which is the focus of two similar organs on one thing, or "point." The other is "intuitive" or "spiritual" seeing which is done by focus of "bi-polarity," and the circle of the astrological wheel is also the symbol of the "frame-work" of this "seeing." The astrologer looks at the horoscope with a focus of both of his generic elements--this focus is the single eye of understanding; he draws on his intellectual resources to calculate the chart and study its elements from a technical standpoint but he also draws on the resources of his memory-of-experiences in past incarnations as male and female to perceive the spiritual values of the factors contained in the chart. An astrologer functions as a composite of both polarities when his intuitive perceptions are ignited by concentration on a chart; he understands the consciousness of both sexes and is able to evaluate the astrological indications accordingly. East-west, north-south must be studied in any chart of any human being. We are all causers and reactors to the effects of causes-- and always have been. The astrologer, focussing the bi-polarity--the Center- Point--of his consciousness, is able to perceive the objective and subjective evaluations of astrological placements and patternings; in other words he perceives, through the circle of his spiritual insight, the tendencies of the person whose chart is being studied from the stand-point of his being a "Causer," and a "Reactor to the effects of causes." The astrologer must know the life of the Spirit as well as the life of the body (Consciousness and Action)--"subjective life" and "objective life."

Because a horoscope is what it is (a symbolic picturing of the interpretation of life-principles by an individualized consciousness in incarnation), we do not do horoscopes of discarnate persons or sub-human archetypes. Impress your mind with this thought: The circle is not the basic design of the horoscope; the cross of the vertical and horizontal diameters is. The circle is only because the ascendant-radius is, and the ascendant-radius is only because the point is. The circle is, in fact, the last factor in astrological symbolism because it is the manifested perfections inherent in the potentials of the point. A blank circle does not show the action of bi-polarity, therefore it cannot he considered the basic design. The basic design must fulfill the purpose of indicating the action of bipolarity because that action is what life is. All other factors obtainable, a horoscope can be done without drawing a circle; but to have any horoscope at all the ascendant-degree is imperative--having the ascendant-degree you automatically have the cusp of the seventh house. Having these two factors presents the picture of basic complementation, and that factor, more than any other, is the design of essential bi-polarity of the individualized consciousness--the life-essence of life itself.

The horizontal diameter, because it is a line, is not of itself--and cannot be--a design; but because its extremities touch the circumference of the circle it serves to create a design within the wheel. This design of two semi-circles is the arch-symbol of symmetry and symmetry is the bi-polarity of design;"male-female" is the symmetry of sex and "masculine- feminine " or dynamic-receptive " or " expressive-reflective" are the symmetries of GENDER. This horizontal line which serves to "activate" the potentials contained within the circle is the symbol of all differences between the polaric expressions of the universe or, correspondingly, of human nature. A diameter of a circle does not "divide" the circle into "two things;" it activates the polarity of everything represented by the contents of the circle which are, in turn, emanations from the central point. Further, the diameter, which is the two-fold aspect of the ascendant-radius, is the picturing of the bi-polarity of the central point, "unfolded" in the simplest and most direct manner possible. The lower and upper semi-circles, then, are the fulfilled expression of each polarity--the two, reunited, form the complete circle which is the total composite of polarity. "Male and Female" are the words which symbolize the chemicalization of polarity-differences on the generative plane of being. Now, to consider the design of the bipolarity of each polarity; keeping in mind always that everything represented in a horoscope is emanation from the central point:

The relationship between two planets which we identify by the ninety-degree angle is the square--arch-symbol of congestion of potentials. In its appearance as we use it, it rests on a horizontal base and its two sides are verticals--variations of the archetypal symbol of the Cross--"compressed" within limitations implied by the circumference of the circle. This registration of the square-design is called "evil" by some because it pictures a tendency to remain "unexpressive"--therefore "dead," which is "anti-Life." The "pain" implied in this registration is the ignition of potentials by evolutionary forces working through human consciousness in order that the life-potentials may be released against a "built-in" inertia. This square, applied to the contents of a circle, touches the circle at four points (those corresponding to the mid-points of the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh houses), the fixed signs of the zodiac, the power resources of desire-love. The regeneration of these resources is the great "integral magic" of alchemy--the apex of spiritual endeavor. But these points being "mid- points," do not coincide with the cusps which, in turn, are emanations of the "I AM" of the one ascendant-radius. There is only one representation of the square-symbol that not only coincides with the house-cusps but is structurally symmetrical and equilibrated: the square whose angle-points are the cusps of the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth houses--the cardinal signs of the Great Mandala, which are the structure-points of basic human relationship. And "inertia" and "counter-active-to-inertia" (the polarity of life-processes) is represented in this square in a remarkably illuminating way since it deals directly with the "humanity of relationship."

In the exact center of a piece of paper place a point. From the point, draw a line horizontally to the left about two inches long; retrace back to the point and draw another line vertically upward the same length; retrace back to the point. On the upper side of the horizontal and on the left side of the vertical write the word "male." Now, from the point, a two-inch line to the right, back to the point, a two-inch vertical downward, back to the point; you have created the "lines of force" in the design of basic human-relationship. Place the symbols of the cardinal signs appropriately, according to the Great Mandala. Now, the angle made by each pair of successive lines from the point is a right-angle, the same as is found at the structure points of the fixed sign square. Aries and Capricorn represent "inertia"and "action" in this way: Aries is the "male begotten;" Capricorn is the male begettor.

Give this careful thought: the "tendency to evil" which is symbolized by the design of the square means this: the tendency to continue to express from a level of protracted spiritual inertia. When we do not grow and unfold, we retrogress; retrogression is the supreme blasphemy because it represents a counteractive to the fulfillments of life. The static potentials of immaturity must be released and fulfilled, and "immaturity" is the relative UN-fulfillments on any level, octave, or cycle. To look at our design again, the angles and lines of force in the cardinal figure and the fixed-sign square:

In the cardinal figure, draw a little arc near the point connecting the lines representing Aries and Capricorn; draw another little arc connecting the upper-horizontal and the left-vertical of the fixed- square. These two arcs enclose two expressions of "right angle; " the cardinal is "open," the fixed is "closed"--at least as far as relationship with the entire designs are connected. The Aries-Capricorn right-angle unfolds the upper-left quadrant of its wheel; the fixed-square right-angle focuses the up- per-left quadrant of its wheel. Do you see how the design of the square aspect, in its essential nature, depicts potential for unfoldment and potential for congestion? Draw arcs in both figures, analogous to these two, relating Capricorn-Libra to the upper-right quadrant of the fixed-square, Libra-Cancer to the lower-right and Cancer-Aries to the lower left quadrant; each open central right-angle of the cardinal "cross" has its potential for congestion shown in the corresponding angles of the archetypal fixed-square. These two aspects (polarities) of the square-design show the "counter-thrust"- -against each other-of the dynamic and inertial tendencies of human consciousness. Every "immaturity" ("child-hood-ness") of consciousness must transcend the inertial tendency to fulfill itself in the symbolism of the circle. The dynamic and congestive "angles" in these two figures-since each angle is a relationship of two factors of the potentials of the point--is the eternal urge of cosmic polarity through human relationship-consciousness to fulfill the potentials of the archetype "humanity."

The study of astrological symbols as pictures is a fascinating mental and esthetic exercise. These symbols, for the most part, have been used from ancient times as delineations of realizations of life- principles. This discourse will pertain to the geometric essence of these symbols as they may be correlated to the geometric values of the graphic Art of Drawing, the abstraction of the Art of Painting.

After having experienced incarnations for many ages, we have a subconscious or instinctive reaction to geometrical designs as picturings of Cosmic principles, actions, processes--and their chemicalizations in Form. The essential designs which the artist uses to present his concepts of archetypes are themselves archetypal As a graphic art, astrology pictures the consciousness of the archetype "humanity"-the basic resource of all human conceptuality. The archetypal quality of astrological symbolism (" simple-ism") is such that the meanings of the principles represented by them become more basically comprehended as the consciousness of the human being is clarified by the alchemies of regeneration. This clarification results in a distillation of power which, through artistic manifestation or interpretation, serves to stimulate, vivify and illuminate the consciousness of less evolved persons. As the consciousness of the artist is "impregnated" by at-tunement to inspirational forces, does the power of his consciousness, released through his artistic work, "impregnate" the consciousness (inner knowing) of individuals; the result, on both octaves, is the "birth"of a new level of realization. The response of the artist and of the individuals to the impact of inspirational forces is alchemy of a subtle, but very powerful, kind. It is magic that is closely akin to the magic of love because, in both, archetypes are perceived in degree. The inertia of self- isolation is decrystallized and the divine is glimpsed. Every such experience of a person responding to the inspiring power of manifested beauty is a degree of "Hermetic Marriage"--realization of "re-union with the Higher Self."

Because designs are emanated from line, let us consider the gender of straight lines, which are the abstractions of curved lines. The vertical is dynamic and stimulative; the horizontal is quiescent and receptive. As such, these two symbolize causation and reactor to, or effect from, causation, respectively. The diagonal which connects a vertical and a horizontal is the dual-generic reflection of both. (The gender of curved lines is determined by the quality of the straight line which connects the two ends.) The vertical, by itself, stimulates what? The horizontal, by itself, reacts to (or is affected by) what? When the arms of a right-triangle are a vertical and horizontal the diagonal hypotenuse is opposite to the right angle and reflects that which is generated by the jointure of the two lines. As such it is analogous to the relationship of a child to his parents who reflects, to a degree, the qualities of both father and another. Every straight line enclosed by a circle ignites the potentials of the contents of the circle; therefore, the vertical and horizontal diameters together ignite the contents of the circle in a four-fold way--the quadrants initiated by the cardinal signs; each semicircle is therefore "ignited" in a two-fold way which results in the picture of the sympathetic vibration which attracts Father-Mother-Son- Daughter together to form the "enclosure" of the human-family pattern. Two kinds of vertical and horizontal are qualified by the four diagonals just as "man-woman" is qualified as "parentage" by the children they beget.

Designs and line-formations not only imply shape and form but also action, releasement, congestion, involution, evolution, staticness, radiation, gravitation and many other kinds of life-action. To be static means to be "poised between preceding and succeeding movements"--and movement is cosmic alchemy. Nothing in manifested life is eternally static but this state of equipoise is just as important as movement because radiation of power succeeds focus of power. The chemicalized Universe is Nature 's agency of focussing her powers so, actually, the word "static" means "focalization;" it does not and cannot mean "dead" or "un-living." From this stand-point, let us consider a few "static" astrological symbols.

All symmetrical symbols convey an impression of being static because they are laterally balanced, but there is a world of difference between symmetrical symbols which are open and those which are closed. The most static astrological symbols are those for the square-aspect and the Sun. Of these two, the square-aspect (because it completely lacks curve or diagonality) is the more static. This square, with horizontal base, is "all up and down, and straight across" with "inflexible" angles and a complete lack of fluidity or adjustability. It is the solidification of the four right-angles inherent at the central point and its "personality " may be described as: compression, rigidity, leashed power, implacability, heaviness, im-movability, crystallization, self-righteousness, opinionatedness, prejudice, fear-ignorance, the "letter of the Law," and gracelessness. Since its astrological meaning, as a symbol, is congestion of potentials we get an impression of "strength" from the square-aspect symbol but it suggests strength that is not being used, muscle and intelligence that are not being exercised. Love-potential corroded by hatred and self-interest (of the wrong kind). The square is "definite" and "clear-cut;" so, we recall, are its effects. When we experience the stimulation of our square-aspects (life-forces trying to jar us loose from congestions in inertia and immaturity), the square speaks to us in "his" blunt, forceful, and uncompromising way. "Idle" is like "square people," who express themselves with definiteness and very telling effect, but who are somewhat lacking in tact or graciousness. The square is the picture of "two-times-two"--the essence of formal structure and therefore the essence of what is known as "classicism" in art. Classic art is preoccupied with symmetry of structure and clarity of outline, whatever its medium. Mediocre classic art is "congestion on form" and "lack of inspirational powers; " great classic art happily weds the two. Aspects, art, human-nature, or what-not--the square is power in a state of relative inertia; study drawings that are focussed on the square-design; what is your reaction to them?

Circular designs, by their essential nature, are of two principal types; the static-circular is radiative, the mobile-circular is convolutive. The three arch-radiative astrological symbols are those of the Sun, the wheel itself and the sextile aspect; the first two are closed, the third is open. Of the three, the sextile is the most radiative because its "rays" are not bounded. Only the point in the center of the Sun-symbol makes it suggest radiation; the circle of the symbol is really a picture of fulfillment of the potentials of a specific archetype. The astrological wheel is a "large-scale Sun-symbol "--the lines of force of which are the twelve basic octaves of "I Am," which, in turn, is the chemicalized potential of the central point. The three diameters, or six radii, represented in the sextile symbol are the Spiritual Trinity of the fire and air signs--the masculine polarity of male and female sex of humanity. It pictures, by its "unbound- ness, " the universality of alchemy centered in the Unknowable, Father-Mother God or the individual human-being. The effect of radiative design is one of impact and illumination--the "sensation" which accompanies alchemical exercise. When you experience the "impact" of an alchemical effort, your solar-plexus is analogous to the center of the sextile symbol, with relationship to your body. The emanation from your charged or regenerated consciousness can extend indefinitely into the world of other people and conditions If you focus your charged consciousness on one thing or one condition, then you "bind it with a circle." Look at the Sun, Moon, and stars when they are shining with full light; look at people's faces when they smile; what do we do to express a friendly greeting? We radiate by extending a hand to the other person who takes it in one of his. This is the interlocking of the fire and air trines of the sextile lines-of-force to create a two-fold magnetic interchange. Radiative design reaches out to us from the center of its theme as people reach out to us and we to them. A radiative design representing an extremely unpleasant subject can repel us, as unpleasant people do, and as we do when we are unpleasant. When the subject itself is of an inspirational nature the "sextile radiation" can charge us with an impact of beauty and inspiration that conveys a feeling of exaltation and renewal. Study radiative designs in pictures. Let yourself feel their archetype.

Convolutive-circular design symbolizes recurrent action around the central point. It is more "mobile"than the radiative type and its inner meaning presents quite a different archetype. In astrology we have two basic convolutive-circular designs: Cancer and opposition-aspect. This type of design is, perhaps, the one which most clearly conveys an impression of "gracefulness"--it is very feminine in quality, being rhythmic and entirely curved. The original of the symbol for Cancer was the Taoist symbol called "Yin and Yang;" the enclosure of the two curved figures by a circle makes it the symbol of bi-polarity of seed (that which is enclosed in the womb, or matrix) the archetypal mother-word; Cancer, cardinal and generative, is ruled by the Moon whose basic symbol is a vertical semi-circle; the line connecting its ends is the vertical of the astrological fourth and tenth houses-the "line of parentage." Convolutive-circular design, though it suggests motion, also conveys an impression of monotony-continual recurrence to and from the center. It is not congestion-as in the square; in a closed figure like "Yin and Yang" it is the dormancy of energies not yet expressed, " or Cosmic ebb-and-flow from the center and back to it through evolutionary octaves, as in the opposition aspect symbol. The essence of this kind of design conveys to our inner knowing the rhythmic "return to rest"--which is transition, or sleep, which is a "little transition; " it is soothing in effect, extending out but forever curving in on itself in graceful "foldings" of line.

The opposition-aspect symbol has something of the same monotony of the Yin-and-Yang symbol with the addition of a dynamic factor; the "basic line" of this symbol is the upward diagonal and "rudiment of aspiration" is thereby implied. As an astrological factor, this design is focussed at three points: the midpoints of the second and eighth houses and the central point of the wheel; its essential meaning is: Choice between unregenerate and regenerate expressions or transmutation of the two poles of the desire (Taurus-Scorpio) diameter. This symbol, by its continual "flow" from the central point to the second and eighth houses, implies repetition of experience-patterns, on ever higher octaves, until regeneracy of the desire nature is distilled. This symbol, as an artistic design of two circles tangent to each other at the central point, represents the transmutations by male and by female individuals, of desire-for-possession through stewardship (Taurus-second house); and through love (Scorpio-eighth house); each of these points represents an octave of the potential of desire and. the attribute of love-- this diameter is polarized by the complementary diameter of Leo-Aquarius which are the personal and impersonal octaves of Love-Power. Think of a motion- picture of a person in a swing: "two kinds of up" and "two kinds of down"-- starting and ending at the gravitational center; there is a rhythm and pulse in the "up-and-down" of this type of symbol; it is the eternal aspirational urge of humanity, "up-surging"from the static "beginning" of each octave.

The most dynamic of all circular designs is the vertical spiral; this is a line-design of the essence of the circle perpetuated in time, space and consciousness. It is open, symmetrical, rhythmic and, more than any other design, it conveys a sense of eternal progress It is the most ecstatic of all symbols because (and when we study it we shall see this) it symbolizes the eternal action of cosmic fire, involuntarily and evolutionarily. The "pyr" of "pyramid" means "fire" and the equilateral pyramid is the chemicalized form of the equilateral triangle. The equilateral triangle in turn, is the essential external shape of that which is represented by the involutionary and evolutionary spirals in two-dimensional representation. Think of a pyramid: four equilateral triangles whose bases are the sides of a square; a circle circumscribing the square can be thought of as the first basic level of the spiral. In your imagination, look down on the pyramid from the top: this view of the pyramid presents a central point, the dynamic square of the cardinal signs of the Great Mandala, with its four diagonal, bi-polar lines. The four right-angles of this square are the enclosed reflections of the central angles of the wheel made by the intersection of the Taurus-Scorpio and Leo-Aquarius diameters; they correspond to the four angles of the static square which are the enclosed reflections of the central angles made by the intersection of the Aries-Libra and Capricorn- Cancer diameters. Do you recognize the astrological wheel in this "view"? From any one of these cardinal structure-points (son, daughter, father, and mother-male and female of immature and mature causer and reactor to the effects of cause) the "begotten-of-God"--involved, incarnated humanity, commences its return to its "lost Eden," the central point of the circle, the apex of the pyramid. Humanity, in its Manifested Body, evolves through the exercise of distilled Love-Wisdom, not to a "vanishing-point" but to the realization of the source, which is perfect being. The spiralic line continues, incarnation after incarnation, round and round, through the patterns of human relationship, through succeeding cycles of experience and of octaves of consciousness--but always upward from the basic circle which circumscribes the basic square. As the spiralic circles recede from the differentiatedness of the basic square, they become smaller and smaller-- continually proceeding toward the undifferentiated unity of the apex-point, the central point of the circle. Draw a circular spiral, starting at what would correspond to the ascendant-point of a horoscope, recognize, as you "evolve" the spiral-line toward the central point, that you are letting go of chemicalized separativeness and are becoming more and more aware of your spiritual source, your "God-hood." In chemicalized representation, we do not see the basic circle or the spiral line. Looking at the pyramid "face on," what do we see? The triangle of spiritual identity and attribute--the power- love-wisdom inherent in each one of the basic human identities of which we all partake in our spiralic evolutionary journey.

So--verticality, horizontality, diagonality, radiativity, convolutionality, staticness, congestivity, openness, spiralic ecstaticness, and all the other many qualities that are suggested to our inner knowing by the directions of all emanations from structure points of design are the attributes of that which the artist-who-draws and the astrologer-who- interprets exercise their manifestive and interpretative abilities.

Study astrological symbols anew with the "opened consciousness" of becoming more aware of their design quality. Your astrological awareness will become more and more sensitized and illumined. You will find, in time, that you are evolving a sensitive awareness of the cosmic designs that are inherent in human personality, experience, relationship, and all processes by which spiritual fulfillments are made. Your own living, from day to day, will be seen to be a resource for the expression of your consciousness of the beautiful. Other people, represented by the horoscopes you study, will assume, in your consciousness, an intensified beauty and value. 

### <h3 id="chapter-5">Chapter V: Color</h3>

Color is that attribute of Manifestation of Perceptibility. Since the manifested Universe is the vehicle or instrument of Spirit it has to be conceived and then perceived before it can be put to use; we as "sparks of Spirit" in manifested form, become aware of this instrument by our faculty of sight. The other senses are agencies by which we complete our perception, but by sight we "take the first step."

Therefore, as "perceptibleness" (we see "things" as "patches of color"), color has a great significance in regard to the occult nature of manifestation. If we are here to unfold awareness of the principles of life, are must learn about the functions of material things and also about what they mean as chemicalizations of archetypes. To understand the nature of a material thing as well as its function is to understand the purpose of its archetype; to understand the purpose of an archetype is to understand, in degree, a life-principle. Archetypes, in composite, are the primary manifestations of life; the life of the archetype is the "life-cycle" of its manifested chemicalization. "Archetype and manifestation" is the most direct reference we can make to the Cosmic Law of "cause and effect."

We are so accustomed, after hundreds of incarnations, to take for granted the colors of the world that we tend to forget (if we ever have known it) the significance of this attribute in the life-cycle of manifested things. Since all things affect, and are affected by, all other things, can it be that color represents one aspect of the nature of universal vibratory exchange? Colors are emanated and responded to; they affect the things that react to them and they are affected by the things that act on their chemicalized forms. Therefore, if we had "eyes to see," we could study this aspect of vibratory emanation of manifested things and learn about the nature and significance of their archetypes--their realities.

The study of color has always had a place in those approaches by which human beings have sought to understand the inner and outer nature of their own archetype, humanity, and that of the other octaves of manifestation. It might be said, with some justification, that the study of life is the study of vibration which is the essential action of life. The Great Ones who teach us serve to ignite in our consciousness the awareness of vibration because they know that matter is not a "dead thing" but the manifestation of something that is eternally alive, rhythmically pulsating, ever releasing and fulfilling its potentials but never changing in essence.

Since we are here concerned, in this study, with color as a factor in art-expression, astrological symbology and the truths concerning the nature of the archetype, Humanity, let us recall, in part, what has been given as instruction pertaining to the colors of the human aura. The author, not being as yet qualified, has never had the experience of perceiving the human aura, but several acquaintances, and perhaps many of you students, have. The one outstanding fact in the information conveyed by this experience is the color-attribute of this vibratory body. Regardless of extent, brilliance or dullness, it is understood that color is seen in every aura. In fact, without the at-tribute of color, the aura could not be seen at all, much less studied and analyzed; though its power can be "sensed" by sensitive persons through their reactions to the vibratory quality of the " aura- person." In other words, that which is "sensed" (by feeling-reaction) is that which is clairvoyantly seen as color of the aura.

The composite of etheric bodies of human composition is one of the many forms of the archetypal state "matrix;" another form of "matrix" is air--in which we are all enveloped; still another is water (gestation), place of generative manifestations. Air and water, so it is said, are "color-less." If, however, air and water did not possess, in degree, the attribute of color-vibration how could light be directed through them? How could they reflect color? How could colors be perceived through them? It is an occult maxim that in order to manifest on any plane, a suitable vehicle is necessary; how, then, can color manifest in and through air and water if they, as "elements," did not possess in their essential nature that which corresponds to the nature of colors Can it be that the "colorless-ness" of air and water is the only true white there is, and that which we designate as "pure white" corresponds to the "colorlessness" as the physical body corresponds to the etheric matrix? Or as any fulfilled manifestation corresponds to its archetype, as a rose, in the full beauty of its perfect maturity corresponds to the "rose-archetype," as the most highly evolved specimen of an animal-species may correspond to its group-archetype ? (Food for thought!) Color is truly one of the mysteries of manifestation because, by it, the divine essence of manifestations is perceived in a specialized way. Color corresponds to design as a philosophical truth corresponds to the ceremony or ritual which symbolically transmits it to the inner knowing of humanity; as love between husband and wife corresponds to the incarnation of a child; as aspiration corresponds to service.

We must use analogies:

If we may consider the "colorlessness" of air and water to be archetypal white (and as such, the "color-symbol" of the Unknowable, the Infinitely Subjective), then the purest of what we call "white" is manifestive white. This, in turn and by correspondence, is the color of Father-Mother God in its essence and in its two expressions of "Virgin Spirit" and "Perfected Consciousness." (Why do we associate "white" with purity?) Purity is "undifferentiatedness," innocence is "not refracted by experience"; perfect-ion is realization of one-ity (unity). Anything that we describe as "perfected" is fulfilled, harmonious, and complete in the relationship of its parts to each other and to the total. White is "innocence before refraction of light" and the "perfected re-un-ity after refraction." In its relationship with the spectrum-colors, white symbolizes the relationship between perfected consciousness and the differentiatedness of soul-qualities which we designate by such words as courage, patience, integrity, etc. In its relationship to black, white is spiritual source and black is utmost chemicality of the emanations from the source. Consider this analogy: archetypal white is universal causation; manifestive white is universal bi-polarity; black is the densest of universal chemicality. Black is a very interesting subject of thought and study, and a fascinating subject for philosophical meditations. It has been used (poor thing) for ages to symbolize mankind's concepts of hell, death, and evil--in short, the color-symbol of the Devil. An injustice, no less. Black as a "color" in the material universe, is the compression of brown (the composite of all spectrum-colors) and brown is the color-symbol of productive earth--our home in incarnation. Black, then, is the congestion of productive life-forces but congestion does not mean death in the absolute sense--congestion is a little death which can, must, and will be decrystallized ("redeemed"). A color that would symbolize absolute death would have to correspond to archetypal white as black corresponds to manifestive white. And no such "color" exists because black is the "mid-point" between white and white. The square (congestion) aspect between two planets in a horoscope would represent two colors which by their relationship have the effect of "blackening" the shade of each other--you have seen, have you not, "blackish red" or "blackish greens" These shades represent degrees of congestion of color-potential toward a common point of "staticness." Black is not recognizable as "red" or "green" or any other color--it is the UTMOST density (lowest vibration) of all colors, as manifestive white is the utmost decrystallization of color-powers. In the "Inferno" of the Divine Comedy of Dante the nether-most region of this unhappy place is depicted as a place of the "forever lost," "beyond hope," "impossible-to-redeem," "absolutely no potential," "total negation," and "utterly life-less." It is true, we are told in occult philosophy, that there are a few members of life waves that congest to such a degree that they cannot progress with the others on their particular "wave;" but we are also instructed that, however long they may be held back, ultimately they start anew with another "wave" and so progress to fulfillment.. Thus "hell," as the place of the totally lost, is an illusion, a false concept of life. We feel that the "mercy of life" (or of Father-Mother God) is expressed in the truth that all potentials are to be eventually redeemed--no one and no thing is "forever set apart and discarded." The "color" black could, of course, symbolize the state of "congestion-to-such-a-degree-that-progress-is-for-a-time-inhibited" but the eventual progress will be represented by the releasement (on a new cycle) of the congested potentials of black. Your astrological aspects will approach " blackness of color " to the degree that the squares are approaching the exactitude of ninety degrees and are unrelieved by the assistance of sextiles or trines. To the degree that the squares are removed from ninety degrees will their color be more evident. To the degree that your planets are trined will your planetary colors glow with radiance, power and beauty.

The author is not presuming to present "absolute truths" in these symbolic color-picturings; however, we, as astrological students, become so accustomed to seeing astrological art presented by "black marks on white paper" that we forget the value of "thinking chromatically." Since we are dealing with the spectrums of designs and vibrations we must, from time to time, exercise our minds on the colors that are implied in drawn symbols; these "implied colors," in turn, symbolize the spectrums of human consciousness and experience, and we must perceive "gradationally" if we are to unfold our understanding of "placement-qualities," "relationship- qualities," and the "archetypal nature" of the planets as focalizers of the zodiacal signs. A little more food for thought: archetypal white as it "manifests" in the five color-octaves of three octaves of the point, line, and circle of astrological symbology:

The five manifested octaves of archetypal white are : (1) Manifestive White ; (2) Grey (neutral); (3) the Colors of the Spectrum; (4) their composite, Brown; (5) their congestion, Black. The three octaves of point line, and circle are: (1) Cosmic (the Unknowable); (2) Solar (Father-Mother God); (3) Human (the Great Mandala of the Archetype, Humanity, and the personal mandala of the individual horoscope).

1\. Cosmic--the point, line and circle of cosmic ideation; the center is archetypal white; the Ascendant-line is manifestive white and the Ascendant-point is neutral grey, the abstraction of brown and the "composite" of the extremes of manifestive white and black. We cannot know the extent of that which is manifested by the Unknowable so its "appearance" at the Ascendant-point must be the indefinite, neutral, "extentless-ness" of grey. Grey is "boundless," it combines and blends with all colors and it is, more than is any other "shade," that which can convey a sense of indefinite, infinite manifestation, focalizing no one thing, but symbolizing "All-that-is- ness."

2\. Solar--the Manifestive action of Father- Mother God; the center is manifestive white; the Ascendant-line modulates from manifestive white through grey and through brown (composite of all spectrum- colors) to the Ascendant-point which is black; the black Ascendant-point symbolizes the total chemicalized manifestation, to the densest degree, of this solar-system; in the black are found all of the color-expressions which are symbolically inherent in the natures of all beings of this system and which are to be "released" as specific color-symbols of consciousness- gradations during the evolution of these beings in incarnation-cycles.

3\. Human--(a) The Great Astrological Mandala of the archetype, Humanity; the center is manifestive white, the Ascendant-line modulates from white through grey and brown; the Ascendant-point, the "I Am" of the individualized archetype is red, the first cardinal color which corresponds to the first cardinal sign of the mandala, Aries. The three variations of the "I Am" of Humanity are the cusps of the (in clock-wise order from the Ascendant) 10th, 7th, and 4th Houses; the total of these four "I Ams" is the I Am of the basic human family: male and female begettor, male and female begotten; male and female of causation and male and female of reaction to, or effect from, causation. Since scientists who study and analyze color tell us that there are four basic primary color-senses (red, yellow, green, and blue) we shall ascribe each of these to a cardinal point of the Great Mandala: Aries, red; Capricorn, yellow; Libra (complement of Aries) green; and Cancer (complement of Capricorn and initiator of the last Trine of the generic spectrum), blue. The fire-trine will be represented by gradations from pure red through orange; Earth--yellow through its darker shades to air-- green (in its modulations to water) blue--carrying through to complete the spectrum at Pisces in purple, color symbol of divine qualities and last color of the basic sequence of spectrum. This is one approach. You may find another, or many others. But--find something!

3\. (b) Human--the personal horoscope of an individual human-being: in unevolved humanity, the center is the red of blood; in evolving humanity it is the red of the individualized "I Am" blended with the redemption of white; the Ascendant-line modulates through grey and the color of the ray to the color that may be identified with the planetary ruler of the Ascendant-sign. This color will represent the temporary (for this incarnation) variation of the red-white of the center. The color of the ray is a "basic" to each human being during the entirety of his or her evolutionary progress in incarnation. Philosophic or occult knowledge sooner or later reveals the nature of one's ray and the color that pertains to it. It may be supposed that, in cases of un-evolved humans, the Ascendant-point color might be the brown of Earth which will be "decrystallized" or differentiated as the person begins his spiritual evolution. In the individual charts of humans, blackness may be, as was remarked before, implied in congested planetary aspects, but never at the ASC-point.

There are, probably, as many "solutions" to this study of color in symbology as there are people who study it. But when we loosen ourselves from the limitations of personal feeling-reaction to colors we are better able to focus our awareness of colors as factors in abstract symbology--to correlate the essence of color-vibration with the essentials of symbolic figures. Another approach to study the "basic colors" in an individual horoscope is to synthesize the planetary positions by dispositorship--and create a compositing of the planetary positions by sign- placement. In such a synthesis, all planets dignified will convey a sense of purest color, those in detriment (opposite the sign of dignity) are, to a degree, "neutralized" and their colors will verge toward a mixture with grey. Also, to correlate color with design, study your chart from the standpoint of seeing how your planetary groupings make specific patterns--a grand cross, a grand trine, a square with the alchemicalization of one planet by a third which sextiles it, and so forth. Your horoscope, in whatever form or arrangement, is, in black and white, an abstraction of a painted portrait--in symbols. Look at the planets that are farthest north, south, east, and west-- they are structure-points in your "Astro-portrait;" opposition aspects are "verticals, horizontals, and diagonals" in your picture, etc. But let yourself become more aware of the importance of mentally "colorizing" astrological symbols--it is a most valuable and beneficial exercise of your intuitive powers. 

### <h3 id="chapter-6">Chapter VI: Architecture</h3>

Architecture is, in essence, manifestive art as expression of man's consciousness of cosmic protectiveness.

Whatever man builds, through his expressions in this art, is a symbol of his instinctive desire to enclose, enfold, and protect that which he cherishes. This art differs from the other three- dimensional arts--dance, sculpture, and drama--in that it fills and encloses space. There is a certain utility in the essential nature of this art which also differentiates it from the other arts. Buildings, to fulfill their reason-for-being, must be occupied by something or lived in by someone. Hence, of all the arts, architecture is the least abstract, the most useful, and it is the one that is most basic to the needs of humanity.

An analogy--the blue of sky and the brown of earth are ceiling and floor of man's habitation on this planet, the vast house of our physical living provided as creative expression of God. Because all share this ceiling and floor, man as an individualization of consciousness and as a "spark of Divine Fire," must microcosmically reproduce this pattern as an expression of his God-hood. So, he builds "ceiling and floor" to enclose the heart of his creativities (home and work) and that of his reverence, the church. Since home and church symbolize the core of man 's awareness of relationship to humankind and to God, these "buildings" from time immemorial have stood as the two essentials of architectural endeavor.

The God-hood of human kind is the permanent seed atom which endures throughout the cycle of incarnations. The first house that is built for it is within the maternal body prior to birth. The maternal body is the enclosure of protectiveness with nurture for the incarnating Ego. The etheric matrix is the "outer body" in which we live during incarnation and our physical flesh-body has the enclosures of skin, skeletal, and organic structure in which the seed atom is enshrined. The male parent functions in correspondence to his mate by providing the enclosure of home to protect his two "most beloveds" and the home is a specification of space in which the relationship-life of persons magnetized to each other by specific vibratory requirements is perpetuated. All of these "buildings" (the etheric matrix, the womb, the physical enveloping, and the home) are the "humanity" of that which is "architecture"in manifestive art. Man has never built for himself alone--he has always built, as God builds, as an expression of his octave of Cosmic Protectiveness. As water and, subsequently, air were the original "homes" in which we lived as physical involutions so the great "sea of electrical magnetism" is the "home" of our relationship consciousness and "home" is the individualized chemical expression of man's consciousness of focalized relationship on the generative octave of being. During incarnation, man abides, or can abide, in many houses but relationship with other humans is the "home-life" of his consciousness. We feel "at home" (and this is not just a figure of speech) with those we love, we feel "out of (our rightful) place" with those we dislike. With those we love we "build easily" the fulfillments of relationship--on whatever octave of experience or consciousness. To build beautifully is to express love. To "build unbeautifully" is to emphasize (pile up) the congestions in consciousness of desire-ignorance; the resultant buildings are "shrines to ugliness." Man expresses his "architectural best"when he builds (anything) as an expression of his heart's and mind's highest and best. The soaring spires of temples and cathedrals are designs which symbolize man's spiritual aspirations toward his "lost Eden"--toward which he returns on the upward spirals of evolutionary progress. These spires are variations of the basic design of the pyramid, which we will discuss in this discourse.

That which is intimately external to us is the outer reflection of inner building. Consciousness--and nothing else--is the material we use to build anything, in whatever octave, cycle, or dimension. The result of material building is the effect from the way the man has imposed his mind, talents, and abilities on malleable substances; and mind, talent, and ability all are octaves of consciousness. He imposes his consciousness on the "stuffs of art" to embody his concepts of archetypes in manifestive artistry; he imposes his consciousness on the "stuffs of relationship" as his "embodiments of relationship-consciousness," to enfold, protect, and perpetuate that which is unregenerate or regenerate in human relationships. We can build "caves for jackals and dens for thieves" just as we can build "homes for the beloved and shrines for the adored." All of these, in their myriads of expressions, are building with the materials of consciousness.

Since each human is an individualized consciousness, we are the builders of everything that is manifested in our lives. By incarnating, we serve to build a new identity for our parents as they were instrumental in building a vehicle for us. Each child contributes relationship-material and relationship-experience to the "building" of his parents as individuals and as a couple. He expresses his consciousness, they react; they express, he reacts in the years of his development and for as long as his relationship to his parents endures. The child was magnetized to his parents by law and he built the particular quality of parentage-consciousness by his exercises as father and as mother in past incarnations. In other words, his parents are a chemicalized expression of his consciousness of "parents;" they, in a sense, and in relationship to him, are something he himself has built. Each human being is, therefore, the architect of his own parentage. Concretely this is pictured in the horoscope by the vertical diameter of the cusps of the fourth and tenth houses. The "parentage" of the archetype, humanity, is the zodiacal diameter of Capricorn-Cancer focalized by the planetary architects, Moon and Saturn, the "form-builders" of our vibratory archetype. This diameter is, of course, complemented by that of Aries-Libra as the vertical diameter of a horoscope is complemented by the horizontal diameter of the Ascendant and seventh cusp. Further astrological illustration: we can think of the chart as the blue-print of an edifice, so architectural are the symbols.

A circle with vertical and horizontal diameters; the symbols for the cardinal signs at the structure-points, Aries as Ascendant-sign. Connect the structure-points with straight lines forming a square. The four right angles are the "enclosures" of the angles made at the center by the diameters of the mid-points of the fixed houses (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius); the right angles of the fixed sign square are the enclosures of the central angle made by the vertical and horizontal diameters. The sides of the two squares are the same in length. The cardinal points bisect four semi-circles; the fixed points bisect four quadrants.

The circle is, at one and the same time, the perfect idea "Humanity" in Divine Mind. the perfect manifestation of that idea in form, the perfect objectifications of all the potentials inherent in the Central Point; by the perfection of its beauty it is the archetypal symbol of the Golden Wedding Garment which will be worn by the archetype humanity at the dawn of liberation from this manifestation, or which is worn by each individual at the timing of his liberation. The Golden Wedding Garment is the perfected habitation of the seed atom-- all humans have an etheric matrix, but not all humans wear a beautiful matrix; it is the perfect beautification and purity of this matrix that identifies the Golden Garment, the result of all of our building in incarnation.

Previous reference has been made to the author's conviction that the circle which circumscribes the cardinal square and its "lines of force" (the Cardinal Cross), in combination with the Central Point, is a "bird's eye view" (looked down upon from above) of a pyramid. The archetype humanity involves from innocence--the state of Virgin Spirit--to the utmost of chemicalization by a spiralic process downward from the point in ever-widening (separative) circular windings. The essential perfect potential remains throughout but man, incarnated and new to this plane, sees only the chemicality of life and of his own nature. He does not know his unity with life and only dimly senses it in his feelings of instinctive togetherness with other humans with whom he is closely associated by ties of blood-relationship or clan-affiliation. For the most part he is aware of the differences between himself and his father, mother, and other people: stronger and weaker, older and younger, male and female, etc., but his similarities to other people, regardless of outer appearance, are not recognized until evolutionary processes have been in effect. To know relationship is to be aware of the "inner" of human life, and that awareness is the beginning of wisdom. The consciousness of involving humanity is not aware of the circular essential shape of the beam of light on which they are traveling; it is always circular but when it "strikes the screen of materiality " the undeveloped human consciousness sees only square--the sharp differentiations between people, not the unity by which all are affiliated in spirit.

The two representations of the symmetrical square in our mandala symbolize the structure of the human family and the material from which that structure is built. The family is outwardly the male and female of human generative manifestation; inwardly it is the masculine and feminine of generic consciousness.The structure points of the fixed-sign square symbolizes the focalizations of the diameters of desire-love which is the food-substance of the total of our human relationship--life--the equipment we use to build each home of relationship-exchange. The cardinal structure- points are the four focalizations of human identity--mature and immature of male and of female--Father, Mother, Son, and Daughter; also the male and female as causer and reactor to the effects of causes. From this Cross of the Polarity of Identity, fed by the desire-love resources of the fixed sign diameters distributed by the unsymmetrical diameters of the wisdom octaves of the mutable cross, the upward spiral of evolution starts. As long as a human being must incarnate he participates in these three crosses; but to the degree that separative identity is transmuted into unity, desire into love, and ignorance into wisdom, will the squares get smaller and smaller, continually approaching resemblance to the circle which, in turn, is the perfect outpicturing of the smallest of all circles, the point. You can get a picture of this disappearance of the square by drawing a fairly large circle enclosing the cardinal square. Within the square draw a circle, within that circle another square, and so forth until the figures get so small you can't draw any smaller. Remember that "square" is an archetypal design; "cardinal square,""fixed square," and "mutable square" are three variations of one design; fixed and mutable are sub-archetypes of the cardinal as archetypal design of human identity and relationship. So, in drawing these smaller and smaller squares within smaller and smaller circles, you are really picturing, in essence, all three forms of the square on all evolving octaves. When you drew the first circle for this illustration (and the enclosed cardinal square) you pictured humanity ready to evolve; each successive smaller square and circle, in pairs, represents one higher octave-like the stories of a building that is pyramidal in shape. If you can draw or imagine a pyramid being cut by horizontal planes one above the other you will get the essence of how each spiralic level of the circle-and-cross is analogous to the floors of a building, each floor having many rooms in which different activities take place--or in which different expressions of Consciousness take place. In this drawing indicate "primitive" at the first level, and designate the different levels of the pyramid, cut by planes, as representing different periods in history in which men made noticeable evolutionary progress. On each level the cardinal cross of human relationship-exchange, the fixed cross of desire-love resource, and the mutable cross of wisdom-distillment are found in conjunction, or synchronization, with the eternal ideal that enfolds and interpenetrates them. With approach to the top point (the center point of the astrological wheel as we know it) love and wisdom become more and more fused, and the four identities lose their separative quality and merge more and more into the relationship ideal of fraternity, which is what our relationship to each other really is. We are all fraternal to each other because we are the "sons and daughters" of Father-Mother God; our "sonship" and "daughtership" is our bi-polar essential nature--"male and female" pertain to our nature only when we are incarnate, and in the upper octaves of being it applies only to our spiritual generative state, and the powers of bi-polarity are fused when the perfected awareness of the "one love" is attained. We are aware of "loves" while we are on the lower levels of the upward spiral--we identify the existence of love with the existence, in our lives and experiences, of other people. Actually, love, is one aspect of the circle and is omnipresent in perfect purity on all levels of being. As the top of the pyramid is approached the "separateness of loves" is transcended and the point at the top of the pyramid--the end of the upward spiral--is the perfect consciousness of the " one-ity " of love as Divine Attribute. As wisdom is distilled from experiences on the spiral, the congestions of fear and hatred are dissipated by the light of reason and understanding, which, in turn, are the illuminations of the mind by the power of love and the inspiration of beauty.

Make a copy of a twelve-housed wheel, connect the cusp-points in sequence by straight lines creating twelve isosceles triangles. Each one of these triangles is half of an equilateral triangle, the arms of which are alternate house-cusps. There are two sets of these equilaterals: those of the fire and air trines and those of the earth and water trines. Think of the "Aries equilateral" as being: "masculine Aries and feminine Taurus" and so forth around the wheel. These equilaterals, three of each generic element, having polarity by division into two equal parts, are the real basic houses of the wheel as far as generic consciousness is concerned. Because each of the twelve mundane houses focalizes the principles of one of the zodiacal signs we recognize that they are specializations of the two-fold generic sections of each trine. Get this picture by drawing four wheels and "black in" (in each one) the three signs of an element and the succeeding sign. There is much food for thought in this representation of houses as generic divisions of experience.) The regular appearance of the twelve houses pictures a much more objective representation of cycle-experience during the years of incarnation. They are, in whatever form, rooms on a particular floor of your life-building. To the degree that the vibratory elements of your chart are congested will you be seen to be "living on a lower floor in your life-building."

Think of your horoscope as a floor-plan blue- print of the evolutionary mansion (building) that you are now inhabiting. Your chart symbolically represents your potential for being a spiritual architect; the contents of your wheel represent the soul-materials you are using to build your pyramid--your Golden Garment--the composite of the best of your consciousness distilled from all previous levels of experience and realization. Become more aware than ever before of the beauty of architectural art--let yourself appreciate the esthetic values of fine buildings and, philosophically, let yourself become more than ever aware of their significance to human experience. 

### <h3 id="chapter-7">Chapter VII: Dance</h3>

To dance is to signify, by rhythmic bodily movements, one's consciousness of participating in the world of Nature. To dance is to make the physical body an instrument for the manifestation of archetypes as expressions of emotional states and of spiritual concepts. These emotional states are focussed points of spiritual awareness of such intensity that they "must out" through the instrumentality of the physical body.

As man applied himself to manipulate material substances to express, by building, his octave of "enclosing protectiveness" to house that which he loved and worshipped, so did he dance to express the inner life of that which his physical body enclosed--his consciousness and heart with their dreams, fears, loves, challenges, aspirations, and understandings. "Living" is not just moving through time from place to place in space. It is moving through evolution from point to point in consciousness. To dance means to identify one's self with cosmic movement, which is the alchemical action of life, by rhythmic sequences of archetypal bodily postures. To dance does not mean, as some think, to "outpicture music." Man moved his physical body on this plane long before he ever invented a musical instrument; music and costume are vibratory accompaniments which serve to intensify and clarify the dance-artist's expressions which are, by their very nature, extremely personal. However, dance essentially expresses through its own merits--it does not need other adjuncts to fulfill its basic purpose. Dance is everywhere seen in the natural world; let us personalize a little to study a few examples:

The natural dance of life-expressions is the sequence of unfoldments that follows upon birth and which is concluded at transition. Every manifested factor in the natural world has its timing for un-foldment of potentials and when that unfolding is made without unnatural interference, the plant or animal alchemicalizes its physical form through all the stages of experience according to the rhythm of its basic pattern. So with human beings; we have a "timing pattern" for the unfoldment of our potentials in the stages of growth, but individual qualifications vary the timing for fulfilling experience-patterns. However, human or sub-human, we all dance through these unfoldment-phases of natural growth.

If we think of "dance" as the movements of a physical organism we see its evidence everywhere in the world of Nature. The branches of a tree move to and fro, responding to the wind-forces which play through them--we say that the tree is making beautiful movements with its arms. The waves of the ocean give the impression of dancing by their endlessly busy running up the beach and withdrawing in pulsating sequences of movement, each wave resembles a line of dancers rushing across a stage and back again. The Moon performs a long "bourree" (serene and legato) across the sky at night. The sportive dolphin leaps from the water in beautiful arcs; who is to say that he doesn't feel the same "joie-de-vivre" that boys and girls feel who "dance" by skipping down the street. Skipping and leaping are archetypal movements which symbolize the challenge to gravity and, as movement-symbols, they represent aspirational urges. The whirlings and spiralings of autumn leaves are fine illustrations of dance-movements- sweeping, gliding, up-soaring, fluttering down to momentary rest, then away again in new spirals and arcs. Billowing clouds dance in an eternal dissolving and remolding of shapes as the wind drives them across the stage of the sky; clouds are a perfect out-picturing of alchemical changes--silent and smooth, they melt from one aspect to another in an incomparable beauty of motion. A galaxy of colorful garden flowers, bending and swaying on their stems, is a natural "corps-de-ballet." Think of the many kinds of movements of animals and birds; the haughty parade of the peacock; the circular gliding through the water of fish and seal; the staccato flight of the butterfly; the fluid pacings of cats, and the virile prancing of horses.

How do human beings dance? We all dance according to cosmic plan in our unfoldments of physical and psychic potentialities through the various phases of our growth as organisms. But every individual dances according to the quality of his consciousness. Some people, harmoniously integrated, dance through life in an extraordinary beauty of rhythm. They accept experience as it comes, deal with it, and learn from it to the best of their ability; then, being forward-looking by nature, they pass on to new experience, rhythmically. They exercise a minimum of inner congestion and a maximum of dynamic expression; the entire span of their incarnation is a beautiful arc of evolutionary progress. They work with integrity and idealism--their work-contribution is a true service, a radiation of goodness and true value to all who are affected by it. They love with intensity, amplitude, and joys they are open-minded, receptive to the values of new ideas. Kahlil Gibran, inspired artist and poet, had the soul of a "true dancer;" he said: "Dance with freedom and joy, but tread not on another's toes."

In the metaphorical sense, "poor dancing" is the result of inner congestions. In the physical sense, a person who is afflicted with excessive shyness, self-consciousness, or physical defect does not--and cannot--dance beautifully, with spontaneity and joy. "Spiritual awkwardnesses" are caused by such emotional and psychological congestions as ignorance, negative selfishness, fear, hatred, greed, envy, materialism, possessiveness, frustration and its attendant cruelties, disappointment- patterns, inertia cynicism, and congestion on form-identity. This latter is one of the deepest-reaching sources of "unrhythmic life-dancing" there is. Its essence is a congestion on appearance as reality; it makes the consciousness focus on form rather than on essence and it serves to throw evaluation completely out of line. People who "dance according to form" rather than "according to Spirit" are those who accept the imposition of standards and evaluations by others, rather than by the establishment of standards from the exercise of individuality. They are the people to whom that which has been established is the symbol of security and rightness; they are crucified by caste-consciousness; they tend to evaluate human personality, character, and experience by a materialistic philosophy which congests them on the outer at the expense of awareness and appreciation of inner truths. The corrupt social and religious standards of past centuries picture this kind of congestion. Hereditary value rather than personal value; family, tradition, and social position represented the focus of appreciation rather than did in- dividual worth. Look almost anywhere and at any epoch and you will see congestion on form as the source of perverting and deflecting the natural rhythmic flow of human development and fulfillment. One perfectly superb example is seen in the misinterpretation of a certain spiritual allegory which had the effect of subjugating women for ages--a karmic device by which man's congestion on form reacted upon himself during his female incarnations.

This congestion on form is symbolized astrologically by the planetary scope of "Moon-to-Saturn." Persons who are karmically or evolutionarily conditioned to live within the confines of this "scope" are those to whom individuality is practically an un-opened book. The patterning of the standards by which they live is, for the most part, according to that which was established by others in the past. Education, work, religious thought and ceremony, marriage, training of children, relationship-factors, etc., are prescribed for all, generation after generation. The feudal system of Europe and the effect of Confucian philosophy on the Chinese nation are good examples of this formalization of human experience. Esthetic expressions (and all peoples have them to some degree because the esthetic urge is too basically instinctive to be completely denied by anyone) are, for the most part, highly formalized and traditionalized. The esoteric essences of religion are submerged in accretions of rituals and ceremonies which are performed or participated in with feelings of awe and fear rather than as exercises of spiritualized intelligence. Marriage--which in essence should be the most intensely individualized expression of human life-is for the most part for the perpetuation of estate and name.

We recognize, of course, that there is no "injustice" in people incarnating under such a regime; their consciousness is aligned to the structuralizing of Moon-and-Saturn or they could not be attracted into incarnation through it. But, karmic justice aside, such strict formalizations do inhibit the free flow of expression and unfoldment because fear is such a strong factor inherent in them. For a time on every evolutionary cycle "Moon-and-Saturn" hold the reins; they, together, symbolize the "formal back-bone " of all cyclic experience; but, eventually the individual potentials must be released by transcendence on "that which was;" the planets Uranus and Neptune are the vibrations which represent the "decrystallizing of outmoded form" and the "revelation of the inherent spiritual essence," respectively.

Our subject at hand is dance but let us remember that all participants in a particular art-expression are members of a spiritual family--a "fraternity" of kindred artistic endeavor. Like any other human group, the artistic family (of whatever kind) is just as subject to the tendency to formalization (and crystallization) as in ally other family-group. When form, structure, rule, and traditional standard are emphasized at the expense of inspiration and spontaneous manifestivity, congestion of artistic value sets in. Look anywhere in the recorded history of artistic endeavor of the human family and you will find many periodic points of congestion on form and tradition, at which times a dearth of inspirational power was evident. Folk-dancing originated in the attempt to perpetuate tribal history and religious belief and tradition in a sort of dramatic representation. These "dramas" subsequently became formalized by inculcating the factors of rhythmic movement and vocal or instrumental accompaniment into what we call "traditional dance" and some of these dance-forms in various parts of the world, are ages old.

The ballet is a more cultivated and intricately stylized expression of European "rhythmized drama." Originating in Italy as a factor in operatic representation, it was carried to France, developed into an exquisite formal technique as an indispensable part of representations of music-drama. The plots of these "danced-dramas" were, for the most part centered on fantasies of an "out-of-this-world" romanticism depicting allegorical or mythical subjects. In the later years of the last century the ballet, as a cultivated art-expression, was adopted by Russia and through the inspirational and dramatic powers of artists of that country it was amplified tremendously by the exploitation of its own resources as a dance-art, divorced from dependence on the opera. We still speak of the best of this art-form as the "Russian Ballet;" the manifestive and interpretative artists of that country stamped it with the brand of their particular quality of genius. The ballet companies of the principal Russian cities were recognized as the supreme exponents of this art and their great soloists occupy conspicuous niches in the hall of those immortally renowned by art-lovers throughout the world.

Then toward the last years of the last century, a meteor blazed across the sky of European and American culture and artistic endeavor that shed a radiance of intensified inspiration on the world of dance that was to decrystallize the hyper-formality of ballet tradition into a new octave of dance-consciousness. This "meteor" was Isadora Duncan an inspired, inspiring, and intrepid artiste, and through her dance-service,--one of the foremost "decrystallizers" of the past century.

Astrological students will be interested in her horoscope; it is well worth studying. Data: May 27,1878, approximately 1:00 A.M., 38 degrees N., 1221/2 degrees W. Jupiter should be in the twelfth house, Sun in third; Pisces, ruled by Neptune, is the Ascendant-sign, and Sagittarius is on the Mid-heaven. Suggested reading for information concerning her life-experience and artistic ideals: her auto-biography, My Life, and her Art of the Dance; also many books and brochures by other writers, which are available in most libraries and book stores.

Note that the ruler of the chart, Neptune, is the principle of instrumentation, and one of Isadora's basic artistic tenets was to regard the physical body as a vehicle for inspirational powers. She was intensely sensitive to music, but it has been said of her that she could dance without music because her movements were so harmonious and "right" that she "made music visible." Two factors in her chart picture the universality of her influence: Jupiter, ruler of Midheaven, in the twelfth House in the sign Aquarius is trine to her uncongested Gemini Sun. Her spiritual power was enormous--both as a performer and as a teacher; this aspect pictures the basic religious purpose of her incarnation. You will recognize this when you read testimonials written by people who saw her dance. She incarnated to re- stimulate, through art and beauty (and she was, in her person, one of the most beautiful of women), the pure religious aspirational urge through contemplation of the human body as an "installment of the Divine" and as the vehicle for purely inspired gesture and movement. She brought to the social and esthetic congestions of her age the refreshment of a consciousness which had its abiding place in beauty, truth, and love. She reminded men and women of the essential purity and goodness of their spiritual being and she sought in many ways to encourage people to recover the naturalness of their own inner truths, by living in terms of sincerity, friendliness, and inspiration.

On the world of concert-dance, her influence was almost cataclysmic in its regenerative effect. Her artistic truth was that of sincere inspiration, not that of accrued tradition. Many other manifestive dancers had their part to play in the regeneration of dance-concepts, but Isadora blazed the trail by the exercise of her individualized inspirational powers (Venus-trine-Uranus, in fire signs).

She said in effect: "Live fully and courageously; free yourselves from the fears of out-worn traditions; love from the center of your consciousness with joy, respect, and generosity; live with courtesy and grace; champion the poor, and the oppressed, and heal the wounds of the spirit; lead children to an awareness of their innate beauties of body and soul and help them to know respect for their individual powers and abilities; let women perceive as never before their powers to inspire by the exercise of beauties of heart and mind; let men open their hearts to a renewed adoration of the Beautiful in Nature and in Humanity; let the fraternity of artists work a consecration on human life through fellowship and sincere efforts."

This great logo would have us all "dance" with joy, grace, health, and inspiration. We perceive, in our charts, the rhythmic movements of the planets from time of birth through the cycles of unfoldment and maturity, the patterns of our relationship-life, the challenges which we have created for ourselves and the powers which we have developed to transmute those challenges into triumphs. The fulfillings of these patterns comprise our "dance of life;" let us move with the cosmic forces rhythmically, with joys with courage, and with the inspiration of faith and understanding. This is the dance on the ever-upward spiral of evolutionary progress. 

### <h3 id="chapter-8">Chapter VIII: Music</h3>

The composition of music is the manifestation of archetypes by formalized, rhythmic arrangement of tone. It is the representation of that which is perceived by inner hearing, it is the language by which the intuition of the artist communicates itself to the intuitions of humanity. By correspondence, we might say that prose is to poetry what poetry is to music--three "octaves" of communicative art. Music is "language transcendentalized;" if words are sound-symbols of identities, tones are the archetypes of sounds, and their artistic manifestation in pattern and structure by composite of melody, harmony, rhythm, and tempo is a "speech that transcends, in power, the language of words. " Word-language is a relatively limited communication; its comprehension depends on a specialized exercise of the intellect. Tone-language, essentially archetypal, depends on exercise of intuition and emotion-responsiveness; its appeal is to the instinctual urge of humans to realize ideality. The magic--and it is one of the greatest of all magics of melody and harmony transcends the separativeness of nationalistic consciousness, from which is derived the separate variety of word-language. To respond to music is to hear ideality, and the specialized faculties of the manifestive and interpretative musicians of the world are "channelings" by which messages of great beauty and truth are communicated to the soul- consciousness of humanity.

The planetary triad of "communication" is that of Moon, Mercury, and Neptune. These three planets represent the three octaves of mentation: the subconscious mind of instinct and feeling, the conscious mind of intellect, and the super-conscious mind of archetype-perception, respectively. All humans, however primitive, partake of the first two of these octaves because all are capable of organizing opinion (the Moon) by subconscious feeling and all who can talk have the faculty of intellect- exercise (Mercury). Only those who are capable of perceiving and expressing archetypes are those who function consciously and constructively on the third octave of Neptune as "focalizer" of the vibration of Pisces, the mutable sign of the water-trine initiated by the Moon through Cancer, polarity of Mercury's Virgo, and tenth-house sign of Mercury's Gemini. In its regenerate, spiritualized qualities, it symbolizes the most transcendental faculties of human consciousness--that of communicativeness with the Higher Self and the aware-ness of the existence of the archetype. Let us study the astrological symbol for Neptune:

Exoterically, this symbol pictures the trident of the ocean-god; as such, it carries out the literal, personalized representation by which life-principles were taught to the uninitiated, literal-minded people of ancient times. Esoterically, it is not a trident at all; the up-turned semi-circle is "chalice" or the upraised arms of the horizontal diameter of the cardinal cross of the Great Mandala--the "male- female begotten" of humanity. The vertical line is the same as is that of the Great Mandala--the generative line of parentage, human or divine. The little circle at the bottom of the symbol is the "seed" of the soul body of humanity which is "stimulated into new life" by divine powers. This little circle is analogous to the "Cancer-point" of the Great Mandala and in this symbol it is the "seed" of all perfected realizations, the matrix of the "Golden Wedding Garment." This symbol is truly one of the most beautiful in astrology. It is symmetrical, and its verticality is counterbalanced by the loveliness of the open, up-reaching arms of the semi-circle like a tree with its branches lifted or a human with his arms lifted in an ecstasy of reverence or aspiration or joy. Now to correspond this symbol with that of Venus whose exaltation is in Pisces:

The cross at the bottom of Venus's symbol is closed (rounded out) into the perfect circle of "soul-consciousness;" the circle of Venus's symbol is opened into the chalice which receives the divine. In this "opening of Venus" we see the secret of Neptune's transcendental nature: the beauty of perfect manifestation that Venus symbolizes is actually the formalization of the essential beauty of Neptune. If Venus is the beauty of symmetry, design, and rhythm in art, Neptune is the beauty of cosmic symmetry, design, and rhythm; if Venus is the beauty of perfect manifestation, Neptune is the beauty of archetype; if Venus is the altar or shrine, Neptune is the god to whom the shrine is dedicated; if Venus is the exoteric myth which is created to convey a spiritual allegory, Neptune is the life-principle personified by the myth; if Venus is the melody which moves the heart, Neptune is the archetypal memory-of-experience which is stimulated by the melody; if Venus is the beautiful gesture or movement of the dancer, Neptune is the essence of the emotional or spiritual realization expressed by the gesture; if Venus is the harmonious progression of colors which is the "life" of the painting, Neptune is the inner vision of the painter; if Venus is the composite beauty of melody, harmony, rhythm, and text of a perfectly wrought song, Neptune is that which is transmitted as spiritual stimulus through the composer, thence through the singer, to the audience.

The femininity of Neptune is portrayed by the up-turned semi-circle. A horizontal line is abstractly feminine as the essence of "that which is affected by a cause" but this semi-circle focuses a much more intense feeling of "receptivity." To geometrize: if we enclose the structure of the Neptune-symbol in a circle of which the center-point is the jointure of the semi-circle and the vertical, and if we use the entire vertical of the circle as the vertical of the Neptune-symbol, it is interesting, and illuminating, to note that the two arms of the semi-circle cut the outer circle at the points corresponding to Scorpio and Pisces of the astrological mandala. These two signs plus the "Cancer-point" of the little circle at the bottom of the Neptune-symbol comprise the triad of the water- signs--the feminine--female principle of the zodiac and the triune faculty of sympathetic responsiveness of which the Pisces vibration represents the most impressionable and hypersensitive octave. So we have the aspiration of man- woman opening to the down-pouring of inspirational powers to ignite the "seed" of the soul-consciousness. This, in short, is the picture of inspiration in action; it is the picture of that subtle factor in human nature by which the human instrument becomes a vehicle of the divine (consciously) through spiritualized processes. Neptune, then, is the principle of instrumentation and its power is to make instruments of all artists by whom archetypal communications may be effected.*

All manifestive (creative) artists are priests in so far as they are all "mediators" between the divine and the mortal in mankind. And in no other art does the interpreter more deeply fulfill the role of acolyte than does the singer or the instrumental musician. The fusion of musical value with word-value that is inherent in the art of song is the composite of the abstraction of music with the concreteness of language. The words of poetic sentences and the notes of musical phrases are blended into a strange magical alchemy by which the poetic word is intensified and the musical idea is "concreted." Since tone is the archetype of sound and words are sequences of composited art of song is then seen to be the archetype of the art of poetic reading. The great song-manifestor is one who perceives intuitionally the musical value inherent in the literary text and by the exercise of a fusion of esthetic perceptions, the singer amalgamates these factors into the completed presentation of blended literary and musical art. The instrumental soloist and orchestral conductor fulfill a similar "acolyte- hood" in the realms of more purely abstract music; the orchestra, under direction, is a composite of many "acolytes" who (each in his own way) contribute to the total musical perfection. What, you ask, has all this to do with astrology? Where and how is music to be found in a horoscope? Let us see.

A musical score (lines and spaces grouped in measures) could be written in a circular form, the notes all having vertical stems pointing to the center of the circle. The lowest note of the score would be analogous to the circumference of the astrological circle, the highest note would be analogous to a circle close to the center of the wheel. In the treble and base staves of the ordinary musical lines we have five lines to each staff plus the median line of "middle C"--eleven lines in all. Create a circle big enough to contain ten concentric circles and subdivide into twelve sections just as the astrological mandala is sectioned into the twelve houses. Here we have the "low G " of the bass staff corresponding to the astrological circumference as the "emanation" of the Ascendant--point--the physical attribute, the densest vibration. The "high F" of the treble staff is the innermost of the enclosed circles and it might be taken to correspond, symbolically, to the most spiritual vibration of human consciousness-- analogous to the vibration of Pisces in the Great Mandala.

The upper half of this diagram--a semi-circle enclosing ten other semi-circles is a symbolic picture of rainbow--the natural color-spectrum which has red, the densest color-vibration, as the "outside" of the arc, and purple, the fastest vibration, on the inside--closest to (what would be) the "center of the circle of which the rainbow is a major arc." Here we have color-spectrum, tone-spectrum, and the astrological spectrum of consciousness of humanity, all in one drawing. Draw this picture and think about it as "gradation of color," "gradation of tone" and" gradation of consciousness."

Straightening out the Aries-radius into a vertical and unfolding the composite circle into a straight horizontal picture gives us the tonal spectrum on a specified section of the "great musical scale." (Change the clef-signs and substitute one zodiacal sign and you have the astrological Ascendant which "determines" the personality-type of an individual just as the key-signature and metric signature "determine" the "personality" of the musical composition. Further analogy: the two staves of music might be considered symbolic of all tones that are used in our musical tradition; they might also be considered, symbolically, as the entire tonal range of all audible vibration, just as each specified color of the rainbow has its myriads of gradations, blending imperceptibly into each other by sequence of light-refraction. Astrologically this picture shows the gradation of human evolution, individually or as an archetype, from the densest vibration of utmost primitivity (separative, physical consciousness) to the utmost of spiritualized consciousness in masterhood. The primitive state is red and its tone is the lowest on what-ever symbol you are using; the masterhood-state is purple in color and its tone is the highest on whatever tonal scale you use for symbolic illustration. If you know how to write simple notation, try a simple example of "astro--musicianship:" a circle enclosing four other concentric circles; subdivide into four quadrants (measures); at the point corresponding to the astrological Ascendant, indicate, outside the wheel, a treble cleff, a key signature and " three-four rhythm.

Each of the three signs of each quadrant is, of course, one "count." Using only the treble staff for simplicity, write in the notes of a melody in three-four rhythm--for example, the first four measures of "Missouri Waltz;" each four measures represents a complete "tour" of the circle. Let us further pretend that the diagram is really spiralic. When you finish the first four measures, in imagination, you write the next four measures on (what would be) the next "rung" of the spiral, and so on through the entire song. Another illustration: subdivide the four quadrants into three, creating the twelve astrological houses, or twelve measures of music; intensify the cusps of the first, fifth, and ninth houses, creating three phases of four measures (Fire, Earth, Air, Water) each; indicate "four-four" rhythm. And soon. You can vary your patterns in many ways--the point is this: Astrological symbology, music symbology, and color spectrum are designed in essentially the same way. A circle big enough to enclose several staves could, theoretically, be used to compose a vocal solo with piano-accompaniment or an instrumental combination.

As each musical instrument has its own particular tonal range and tonal quality, so does each planet have its essential quality as a focalizer of one of the twelve zodiacal signs. The "octaves" of a planet are the levels of consciousness that the person has toward the specific life- principle on succeeding evolutionary cycles, just as there are seven "C's" on the piano-keyboard.

If, in imagination, we might say that every human being evolves through seven major development cycles, these would be analogous to the seven octaves starting on the lowest "C" of the piano-keyboard; the twelve half-steps of each octave would be analogous to the twelve zodiacal signs. The planetary ruler of each sign could be analogous to the major triad of each of the twelve keys--Venus and Mercury ruling two each.

You can experiment with this idea in many ways; by a little exercise of your imagination you can analogize several musical and astrological factors. For example: musical discord and square aspect; the modulation from discord to harmony and sextile aspect (modulation from discord to harmony is alchemy expressed in music); the major triad based on a specific tone and the grand Trine based on a specific sign; the root-note of a major triad and a planet in dignity overtones of two notes played together and orbs of two planets in aspect to each, other; the soloist of a musical performance and the planetary ruler of a chart; instrumental or other accompaniment to a soloist and all the other planets beside the ruler of the chart. There is a wealth of imaginative research in making up titles of musical compositions by study of planetary groupings by house-position and sign- position, particularly those of the chart-ruler, as "key-note" of the horoscope. Such analogies can he very fascinating. Your interest in both arts will be intensified and your perceptions of the values of both can be greatly revivified as the result of such practice.

Now, the astrologer as "musician:"

As the great singer or instrumentalist interprets through tonal media the inspired archetypal concepts of the musical manifestor, so does the astrologer, by the power of the word, present his interpretations of archetypes--life principles--when he talks to a client or to a group of astrological students. As the musician develops his physical vehicle by technical exercise, so does the astrologer develop his mental vehicle in the exactitude of calculations and study of astrological technicalities. The "composition" that the astrologer interprets is always the vibratory being (the Consciousness) of humanity. The client is the " composer" of a specified astrological arrangement and the astrologer is the "acolyte" who serves the latent priesthood of the client. The musical manifestor and interpreter exercise their knowledge of esthetic (tonal and rhythmic) media to objectify their concepts of archetypes; the astrologer exercises his knowledge of human-life media as they specialize cosmic principles. The astrologer reflects the essence of what is in the client 's horoscope just as the singer or instrumentalist reflects that which is perceived in the score of the manifestor.

Astrologers "compose" when they devise new symbols and new approaches to astrological interpretation. For the most part, however they--and the interpretative musicians--communicate that which has already been manifested, in horoscopes or in musical scores. As the work of the manifestive and interpretative musician ignites the intuitional hearing of humanity, so does that of the astrologer by speech. The "artistry " of astrological service depends on the clarity with which such ignition can be made. This, in essence, is the purpose of his "star-song" as is the purpose of the others in their "tone-song." Both touch, as perhaps no other two arts can do, the immediacy of the abiding spirit. Both are consecrated to the service of "touching the Spirit" by sound in the most beautiful, efficacious, and inspiring ways possible.

*The above is in full recognition of the fact that "the ray of Neptune carries what occultists know as the Father Fire, the light and life of the Divine Spirit, which expresses itself as will." Like all other planets, Neptune has its "reflective" as well as its "expressive" octave. The feminine polarity of Neptune's quality is that of our capacity to respond to higher-octave stimuli through inspirational attunement. Neptune, in this respect, is the archetypal symbol of our mystic qualities. A great actor or musician projects (dynamically) by his acting or playing or composing. That represents his "dynamic" Neptune. The attunement to archetypes and response to inspirational impulses from the Higher is the feminine polarity of that functioning.
