### <h3 id="suggestion-for-world-peace-meditation">Suggestion For World Peace Meditation</h3>

There is only one force in the universe, namely, the Power of God, which He sent forth through space in the form of a Word; not a single word, but the Creative Fiat. This Creative Fiat by its sound vibration marshaled the millions of chaotic atoms into many shapes and forms, from starfish to star, from microbe to man; in fact, all things that constitute and inhabit the universe. The syllables and sounds of this Creative Word are being sent forth, one after another through the ages. They create new species and evolve the older ones. All this goes on according to the thought and plan conceived in the Divine Mind before the dynamic force of creative energy was sent out into the abyss of space.

God Is the only source of power, and in Him we really, truly, and literally live and move and have our being. It was no mere poetic sentiment when the Psalmist said: “Whither shall I go from Thy spirit, or whither shall I flee from Thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there. If I make my bed in the grave, behold, Thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall Thy hand lead me and Thy right hand shall hold me.”

We all know the power of thought when directed to a given purpose, and we thus can unite our thoughts with those of all peace lovers in the following prayer: “Our heavenly Father, according to Thy will, may the Love-Wisdom Principle of Divine Power eradicate discord and establish harmony and universal peace in the hearts and affairs of men.”

If preferred, the Rosicrucian Fellowship Prayer may be used in response form in the place of a silent concentration, or an oral repetition of the Prayer may be given to break the silence if this meditation is used by a group.

```
Not more of Light we ask, O God, 
But eyes to see what is; 
Not sweeter songs, but ears to hear 
The present melodies; 

Not greater strength, but how to use 
The power that we possess; 
Not more of love, but skill to turn 
A frown to a caress; 

Not more of joy, but how to feel 
It kindling presence near, 
To give to others all we have 
Of courage and of cheer. 

No other gift, dear God, we ask, 
But only sense to see 
How best the precious gifts to use 
We have received from Thee. 

Give us all fears to dominate, 
All holy joys to know, 
To be the friends we wish to be, 
To speak the truth we know; 

To love the pure, to seek the good, 
To lift with all our might, 
All souls to dwell in harmony 
In Freedom’s perfect light.
