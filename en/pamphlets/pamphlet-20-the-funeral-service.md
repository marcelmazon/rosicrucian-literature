```
There let the way appear
Steps unto heav’n;
All that Thou sendest me
In mercy giv’n;
Angels to beckon me,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
```

### <h3 id="address">ADDRESS</h3>

“But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him.” (I Thess. 4:13-14.)

“But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?…That which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be:…but God, giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him, and to every [man] his own body.

“All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another flesh of fishes, and another flesh of birds. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.

“There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead….It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.” (I Cor. 15:35-44.)

One of the tests of the value of religion is the comfort it gives us when sorrow and trouble try the heart. Ti fulfill its mission it must bring comfort in sorrow, particularly at the time of the final separation from our loved ones. When the reaper Death strikes, when it pleases God to end the present earth life of our relatives and friends, when our human resources have been exhausted, then we look to religion for courage and fortitude to bear the burden of our great loss and our sorrow.

How do the Rosicrucian Teachings meet these requirements? They tell us in the first place that death is not the end; also how, under the Law of Consequence, the fruit of our actions in this life, whether good or bad, must at some future time be harvested, for the Bible says, “Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.”

We know that it is as impossible to cancel our good or evil deeds by merely passing out of this body as it is to compensate our debtors by removal to another city. The debt still remains, and sometime, somewhere, it must be liquidated.

We rejoice when a soul is born, that is, encased in a robe of clay; but we weep when this form is cast off at death because we do not realize that such conduct is the exact reverse of what it ought to be. The spirit is imprisoned in this coat of clay at its birth into this physical world, to be subject for many years to the pains, aches, and infirmities to which all flesh is heir. This physical life, however, is necessary that the soul may learn its lessons in the school of life.

If weeping is to be indulged in, then we should weep when the spirit is born into this world; but we should rejoice when death comes to liberate it from the pain and discomfort of physical existence. if we could see and know the relief which our loved ones feel when they are freed from a suffering body, we should truly rejoice, and no longer weep. Think of a poor soul, who has been chained to a bed of sickness, when it awakens in the invisible world where it is able to move about freely whither it will, and free from pain. Should we not bid such a soul Godspeed and not weep?

It has pleased God to call our friend,………………………….., to a greater work, to broader fields, in another world where he (or she) has no need for a physical body, and he (or she) has therefore laid this garment away.

(Short talk here relative to the qualities and past activities of the departed person.)

As a child goes to school day after day for the purpose of gaining knowledge, with nights of rest between the school days, meanwhile growing a body from childhood to the full stature of manhood or womanhood, so also the spirit attends the school of life during a succession of life-days, and inhabits a series of earthly forms of gradually improving texture in which to gain experience. As Oliver Wendell Holmes says:

```
“Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
As the swift seasons roll!
Leave thy low vaulted past!
Let each new temple, nobler than the last,
Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,
Till thou at length art free,
```

Leaving thine outgrown shell by life’s unresting sea!”

We know that our friend will come back sometime, somewhere, with a better and nobler body than the garment which he (or she) has discarded. We know that under the immutable law of association he (or she) must return so that by repeated lives and friendships his (or her) love nature may be widened and deepened into an ocean of LOVE.

Death has lost its sting so far as we are concerned, not because we are callous and love our friends and relatives less, but because we are convinced that we have absolute proof that there is no death. We have no cause for grief because the silver cord has been loosed and the body is about to return to the dust from whence it came, for we know that the spirit of our friend is more alive than ever, is present with us now though unseen by most of us.

The garment which this spirit inhabited we consign to the fire, that its elements may be transferred to other forms by the alchemy of nature.

As the poet Arnold says:

```
“Never the spirit was born!
The spirit shall cease to be never!
Never was time it was not,
End and beginning are dreams.
Birthless and deathless remaineth the spirit forever;
Death has not touched it at all,
Dead though the house of it seems.

“Nay! but as one layeth
A worn-out robe away,
And taking another, sayeth:
This will I wear today,
So putteth by the spirit
Lightly its garment of flesh
And passeth on to inherit
A residence afresh.”
```

Let us send up a prayer asking the aid of God in speeding our departed brother (or sister) on his (or her) way to take up his (or her) new work on the other side.

(Close by singing the last verse of the Rosicrucian Fellowship Closing Hymn.)

### <h3 id="god-be-with-you-till-we-meet-again">GOD BE WITH YOU TILL WE MEET AGAIN</h3>

```
God be with you till we meet again
At the Cross with Roses garnished;
May our lives be pure, untarnished,
Till the Rosy Cross we greet again.

REFRAIN:

Till we meet, till we meet,
Till we meet, the Rosy Cross to greet,
Till we meet, till we meet,
God be with you till we meet again.
