### <h3 id="rosicrucian-fellowship-purposes-aims-and-activities-h3">Rosicrucian     Fellowship - Purposes, Aims, and Activities</h3>

The Rosicrucian Fellowship is a Christian organization composed of men and women who are students of the <a href="www.rosicrucian.com/wwisdom.html">Rosicrucian Philosophy</a> as presented in <a href="www.rosicrucian.com/rcc/rcceng00.html">The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception</a>. This philosophy is known as the <a href="www.rosicrucian.com/wwisdom.html">Western Wisdom Teaching</a> and establishes a meeting ground for Art, Religion, and Science. Its students are located throughout the world; but their International Headquarters is located at Oceanside, California, USA.

The Rosicrucian Fellowship has no connection with any other organization. It was launched during the late summer and autumn of 1909, after a course of lectures in Seattle by Mr. Max Heindel. A study center was formed and the Headquarters were temporarily located in that city. Arrangements were also made for publishing <strong>The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception</strong>. With the issue of this work by the Rosicrucian Fellowship, the Association was definitely started.

The work of the Fellowship is to preach the gospel (of the coming Aquarian Age) and heal the sick. This is achieved by making the <a href="www.rosicrucian.com/wwisdom.html">Western Wisdom Teaching</a> available to all who are ready to receive it and by conducting a Healing Department which emphasizes spiritual healing along with principles of right living. The work of the Fellowship is done through the efforts of its entire membership assisted by Headquarters. Many friends in the world work through Centers which hold classes in the Philosophy and in spiritual astrology, the study and teaching of which is an integral part of the work of the Fellowship.
