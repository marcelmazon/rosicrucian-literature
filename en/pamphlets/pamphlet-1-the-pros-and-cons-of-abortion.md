### <h3 id="court-decisions">Court Decisions</h3>

So much has been said, and is still being said, written, aired on
radio and television, and argued in the courtrooms about abortion these
days that one is inclined to believe further mention of the subject is
obnoxious to most people. However, the decision in regard to this matter
by the Supreme Court of the United States, which in effect nullifies
restrictive abortion laws in the various states, makes the student of
the deeper truths of life and being more uncomfortably aware than ever
of the imperative need for added understanding of the factors and
deplorable consequences involved in this un-Christian practice which has
become so alarmingly casual and frequent.

Formerly, in most places abortion was legally permissible only if the
welfare of the mother required it. That it was often illegally and
unscientifically performed by unqualified people is well known, this no
doubt being one of the factors in bringing about the movement to
legalize abortion in the United States. Of course, making it “legal” in
no wise lessens the moral implications, even though it may reduce the
proportion of cases where physical harm to the mother occurs.

In its historic decision the Court held that the State’s prohibition
of early abortion would be an unconstitutional invasion of a woman’s
privacy, since the sole legitimate interest of the State in this matter
is to make sure that abortion, as a “medical process,” takes place under
circumstances which provide adequately for the safety of the patient.
This would naturally require the services of a licensed medical
practitioner. Furthermore, in the opinion of the Court, the State can
constitutionally take steps to protect the unborn child only after the
developing fetus has reached the stage of “independent life.” Avoiding
the crucial question as to just when “independent life” begins in the
forming body, the Court went on to add the following: “When those
trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and
theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this
point in the development of man’s knowledge, is not in a position to
speculate as to the answer.”

Since this matter is of such vital import to all of the human race,
both now and in the future, and its consequences so far-reachingly
deplorable and contrary to spiritual unfoldment, it would most certainly
benefit every adult individual to consider it open-mindedly in all its
physical and spiritual aspects. The Court’s reference to “this point in
the development of man’s knowledge” must surely refer only to the
knowledge which is “accepted” by the general public. Fortunately, there
are human beings who have progressed far enough spiritually to have
acquired knowledge not yet accepted by the majority of mankind. Among
those advanced ones are the Brothers of the Rose Cross, Adepts who work
constantly for the welfare of humanity, and who have given out the
Western Wisdom Teachings in their efforts to counteract the insidious
effects of materialism and to further spiritual evolution in
general.

### <h3 id="laws-of-rebirth-and-consequence">Laws of Rebirth and Consequence</h3>

Prominent among the truths in this Teaching are the twin laws of
Rebirth and Consequence. The doctrine of rebirth teaches that each Ego
is an integral part of God, enfolding all divine possibilities; that by
means of repeated existences in gradually improving bodies the latent
possibilities are developed into dynamic powers; that none are lost by
this process, but that all mankind will ultimately attain the goal of
perfection and reunion with God. What we are, what we have, all our good
qualities are the result of our actions in the past. What we lack in
physical, mental, or moral excellence may yet be ours in the future. As
we sow, so shall we reap. Each life provides us with experiences
essential for our progress. If we are not allowed to incarnate in a
physical body, we do not have the experiences.

The generally accepted idea about “killing” (except by the very
materialistic mind, which accepts only form) is that “life” is
terminated, simply because the body is no longer able to function. This
is a mistake. Life is eternal, as both the Bible and occult science
teach, and the individual Spirit inhabiting a body, or beginning to
inhabit it, cannot be destroyed. However, of course, the form in which
it has to live on Earth in order to gain the experience necessary for
its progress can be, and too often is, destroyed. To do this is just as
reprehensible as it is to break any other of the spiritual laws
governing our universe. “Thou shalt not kill” is a basic law for
humanity, even though it refers only to the form, and those who defy it,
by abortion or otherwise, must at some future time pay a heavy
penalty.

### <h3 id="holy-creative-force">Holy Creative Force</h3>

Another most vital point to be considered in connection with the
practice of abortion is the sacredness of the creative power in the
human being. This is the Holy Spirit aspect of God and man, referred to
in numerous places in the Bible (Matt. 1:18, Mark 1:8, Luke 1:15, John
14:26, Acts 2:4, etc.), the power that is used to create not only
physical bodies that is used to create not only physical bodies but
also, on a higher level, mental and emotional accomplishments in
literature, poetry, art, music, science, etc. To misuse this holy power
for gratification of the senses is the “great transgression” spoken of
in Psalm 19:13. This is the “sin” (action contrary to spiritual law)
that is not forgiven, but must be expiated through suffering in diseased
and incapacitated bodies and minds. As Christ Jesus said explicitly:
“All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the
blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.” (Matt.
12:31).

When one considers the intricate and awe-inspiring process which
takes place in the invisible worlds, involving the activities of the
Angels and their helpers, to bring an Ego back into a physical body, and
all of the past causes and effects that enter into this event, he or she
surely must hesitate to destroy the infant vehicle, even if it had been
in formation for only a short time. Let us recount briefly how occult
science describes this process.

### <h3 id="egos-preparation-for-rebirth">Ego’s Preparation for Rebirth</h3>

After having been strengthened in the ineffable harmony of the higher
world called the Third Heaven (mentioned by St. Paul in II Corinthians
12:2), the Ego has a desire for new experiences in the Physical world
and begins to contemplate a new birth. This conjures up a series of
pictures before the vision of the Spirit–a panorama of the new life in
store for it, containing the principal events which begin at the cradle
and end at the grave. In some cases several panoramas may be shown, so
that the advanced Ego has a choice.

Having chosen the life it will live, the Spirit, possessing only the
forces of the four seed-atoms (the nuclei of the dense, vital, and
desire bodies, and the sheath of mind), the Ego begins its descent into
the Physical World. The forces of the mind of the last life are awakened
from their latency in the seed-atom, and begin to attract materials from
the Region of concrete Thought for which it has an affinity. The same
then occurs for the desire, the etheric, and the dense bodies. This
material forms itself into a great bell-shaped figure, open at the
bottom, with the seed-atom at the top. When the proper time comes, the
building of the new body and its placement in the proper environment is
done by the four great Beings known as the Recording Angels, or Lords of
Destiny. The vital body is built by the inhabitants of the heaven world
and the Nature Spirits in such a manner as to form a particular type of
brain. However, the returning Ego itself incorporates therein the
quintessence of its former vital bodies, and in addition to this also
does a little original work.

The vital body, having been molded by the Lords of Destiny, will give
form to the dense body, organ for organ. This matrix or mold is then
placed in the womb of the future mother. The seed-atom for the dense
body is in the triangular head of one of the spermatozoa in the semen of
the father.

When the impregnation of the ovum has taken place, the desire body of
the mother works upon it for a period of time from eighteen to
twenty-one days, the Ego remaining outside in its desire body and mind
sheath, yet always in close touch with the mother. Upon the expiration
of that time, the Ego enters the mother’s body. The bell-shaped vehicles
draw themselves down over the head of the vital body and the bell closes
at the bottom. The Ego broods over its coming instrument, asserting its
individuality and resisting formation by the mother of the nucleated
blood cells. The old cells gradually disappear, so that when the silver
cord is tied at the quickening, all nuclei have disappeared, and the Ego
is absolute autocrat of its vehicle, a precious heritage.

### <h3 id="transmuting-the-sex-force">Transmuting the Sex Force</h3>

Thus we see that abortion, while it does not kill the Spirit, which
is eternal, does destroy the form essential for its use on Earth to gain
necessary experience, and is therefore a most sinful and degrading act.
It matters not at what stage of its growth the fetus is destroyed, the
dire consequences are the same.

What is the sensible solution to this immoral practice? Simply put,
it is self-control. Human beings will at some time have to learn to
master the Luciferian urge and not allow the power of lust to direct
their lives. A high ideal, yes, but upon its achievement depends the
welfare of the race.

However, it should be thoroughly understood that the mere suppression
of sexual attraction is not a virtue in itself. The creative force must
be used – directed into higher channels.

Instead of seeking physical gratification when conscious of the
surging impulses of the lower nature, if the individual will focus his
thoughts and imagination upon something he or she desires to create–a
poem, an invention, a picture, a musical composition, or some material
demonstration such as a poem or a new business venture–he or she will
find that a double purpose is served. The objective demonstration will
be accelerated and the process of transmutation or regeneration within
his or her body will, at the same time, be noticeably stimulated.
Physical exercise alone is also of help, but when accompanied by
creative thoughts is more effective.

Meditation upon high and inspiring subjects has power literally to
transform forces impregnating the sexual fluids, for these fluids are
really carriers of etheric force, the true creative agent. An inspiring
poem or passage from the scriptures can be the channel for immediate
direction of the thoughts and creative power into uplifting currents. By
consciously directing pure love currents from the heart into the
creative centers of the brain, sexual activity may be transmuted into
activities of mind and spirit, with a corresponding birth upon the
mental and spiritual plane.
