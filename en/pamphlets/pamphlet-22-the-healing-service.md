Unveil the Emblem.

A member reads aloud the following Rosicrucian Fellowship Service, beginning with the Rosicrucian Greeting:

My dear sisters and brothers, may the roses bloom upon your cross.

(The members respond: “And upon yours also.”)

It is our custom to meet here once a week for the purpose of carrying out the second commandment of the Christ, to heal the sick. One coal will not make a fire, but where a number of coals are heaped together, the heat which is latent in each may be kindled into a flame, emitting light and warmth.

We are now massing our coals in an endeavor to generate thoughts of help and healing, and to focus them in one direction so that they may be available to aid the Elder Brothers of the Rosicrucian Order in their beneficent work for humanity.

If we wish to be real helpers in the work which the Elder Brothers have started, we must make our bodies suitable instruments; we must purify them by clean living, for an unclean vessel cannot contain pure and wholesome water nor can a spotted lens give a true picture. Neither can pure and strong healing force be sent out from here unless we keep our minds and bodies clean and pure.

It is a privilege to be here in the midst of all these thoughts of love and prayer, and to offer ourselves as channels to receive and liberate the healing force which comes direct from the Father. But before this power can be transmitted, it must have been generated; and to do this efficiently, we should understand accurately what the method is. It is not enough that we know in a vague way of the sickness and suffering which are in the world, and that we have a dim and hazy idea of helping to alleviate this suffering, whether it be bodily or mental. We must do something definite to attain our object. Disease, we may say, is really a fire, the invisible fire which is the Father, endeavoring to break up the crystallized conditions which we have gathered in our bodies. We recognize fever as a fire, but tumors, cancers, and all other diseases are really also the effect of that invisible fire which endeavors to purify the system and free it from conditions which we have brought about by breaking the laws of nature. This very same power which is endeavoring slowly to purge the body can be greatly augmented by proper concentration (that is what prayer really is) provided we have the proper conditions.

To illustrate what these conditions are, we will take the water spout as an example. We may not have seen this phenomenon of nature, but it is wonderful and awe inspiring. Usually at the time when it occurs the sky seems to hang very low over the water; there is a tense feeling in the air of depression or concentration. Gradually it seems as if a point in the sky reaches down toward the water, and the waves in a certain spot seem to leap upward until both sky and water meet in a swirling mass.

Something similar takes place when a person or a number of persons are in earnest prayer. When a person is intensely in earnest in supplication to a higher power, his aura seems to form itself into a funnel shaped form which resembles the lower part of the water spout. This leaps up into space a great distance and, being attuned to the Christ vibration of the interplanetary world of Life Spirit, it draws thence a divine power which enters the man or company of men, and ensouls the thought form which they have created. Thus the object for which they have united will be accomplished.

But let this be borne thoroughly in mind, that the process of praying or concentrating is not a cold intellectual process. There must be an amount of feeling adequate to accomplish the desired object, and unless this intensity of feeling is present, the object will not be realized. This is the secret of all the miraculous prayers which have been recorded: the person who prayed for something was always intensely in earnest; his whole being went into the desire for this or that thing for which he prayed, and thus lifted himself up into the very realms of the divine and brought down the response from the Father.

Let us now concentrate upon the Rosicrucian Emblem on the wall. The pure white rose is symbolical of the heart of the Invisible Helper; the red roses stand for his cleansed blood; the white cross brings to mind his body; and the golden star represents the golden wedding garment which is made by pure living.

Let us, by our prayers to the Father, who is the great Physician, liberate the force for healing, that we may reach those who are looking to us for help, and also those who may not have been able to ask for assistance. Let us put all the intensity of feeling possible into this prayer that we may indeed form a funnel that shall bring down the divine power from the Father. But there is a great danger of misusing this wonderful power; therefore, we should always qualify our supplications for others with the words of the Christ: “Not my will but Thine be done.”

We will now concentrate for a few minutes on Healing.

After the concentration all rise and sing the last verse of the closing hymn.

Conclude the service by reading the following Parting Admonition:

We will now leave the liberated healing force with Christ, the Elder Brothers, and the Invisible Helpers, to be used where it is most needed.
