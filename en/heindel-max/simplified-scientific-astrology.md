### <h3 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION: THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF ASTROLOGY</h3>

There is a side of the Moon which we never see, but that hidden half is as potent a factor in causing the ebb and flow of the earth's tide, as the part of the Moon which is visible. Similarly, there is an invisible part of man which exerts a powerful influence in life, and as the tides are measured by the motion of the Sun and Moon, so also the eventualities of existence are measured by the circling stars, which may therefore be called the "Clock of Destiny," and knowledge of their import is an immense power, for to the competent astrologer the horoscope reveals every secret of life. 

Thus, when you have given an astrologer the data of your birth, you have given him the key to your innermost soul, and there is no secret that he may not ferret out. This knowledge may be used for good or ill, to help or hurt, according to the nature of the man. Only a tried friend should be trusted with this key to your soul, and it should never be given to any one base enough to prostitute a spiritual science for material gain. 

To the medical man Astrology is invaluable in diagnosing diseases and prescribing a remedy, for it reveals the hidden cause of all ailments. This phase of the science is dealt with in "The Message of The Stars," giving numerous horoscopes to show how the signatures of various diseases appear in the stellar script. The writer diagnoses unerringly by this method the ailments of patients all over the world and love will light the way for others also who aim to follow in the steps of Christ as healers of the sick. 

If you are a parent the horoscope will aid you to detect the evil latent in your child and teach you how to apply the ounce of prevention. It will show you the good points also, that you may make the better man or woman of the soul entrusted to your care. It will reveal systemic weakness and enable you to guard the health of your child; it will show what talents are there, and how the life may be lived to a maximum of usefulness. Therefore, the message of the marching orbs is most important, and as we have shown the great danger of giving birth data to anyone else, there remains only one course: To study the science yourself. 

This book and the simplified method it contains of casting a horoscope in a thoroughly scientific manner is published in order to enable anyone who can add and subtract to do the work himself, instead of relying on others. Thus he will obtain a deeper knowledge of the causes which are operative in life than any professional astrologer who is a stranger can give. 

### <h3 id="chapter-1">CHAPTER I: THE PLANETS, THE SEVEN SPIRITS BEFORE THE THRONE</h3>

The nebular theory explains with wonderful ingenuity the material viewpoint of how a solar system consisting of sun and planets may be formed from a central firemist, provided the firemist is put in motion. Something or somebody extraneous to the firemist is necessary to give that first impulse, however, as shown by Herbert Spencer, who rejected the nebular theory because it implies a First Cause, yet he was unable to enunciate a hypothesis free from that, to him, objectionable flaw. Thus the scientific theory of the genesis of a solar system coincides with the religious teaching of a First Cause, call it God or by any other name, who is the superior intelligence ordering the path of the marching orbs with a definite end and aim in view. That end we may not yet be able to wholly perceive, but all about us on our planet we cannot fail to note, if observant, an orderly progression of all things towards perfection, and it may be inferred that a similar process of evolution must be in progress on all the other planets, varying of course, in consonance with the diverse conditions existing on each. 

Mystic teaching concerning the formation of a solar system agrees with the nebular theory which says that rings were thrown off from the central mass of the Sun, forming in succession the several planets, those farthest from the Sun being formed first while Venus and Mercury, last formed, are nearest the Sun. 

Back of every act is a thought, and behind every visible phenomenon there is an invisible cause. So with the formation of the planets in a solar system, there is a spiritual reason for their being, as well as a material explanation. 

The central firemist we may consider the first visible manifestation of the triune God, the Lord of Hosts, Who contains within His Being a multitude of other beings at varying stages of development. Their diverse needs require different external environments. In order to furnish such proper conditions several planets have been thrown off from the central mass, each being differently constituted and each having a climatic condition varying from the others. Yet they are all in the kingdom of God, the solar system. "In Him they live and move and have their being" in the most literal sense, for the whole solar system may be considered as the body of God and the planets as the organs in that body, ensouled by His Life, moving in His Strength in accord with His Will. 

Each visible planet is the embodiment of a great and exalted spiritual intelligence Who is the minister of God in that department of His Kingdom, endeavoring to carry out His Will, the latter having in view the ultimate highest good, regardless of temporary ill. 

These Planetary Spirits exercise a particular influence on the evolving beings upon other planets according to the development attained by such beings. The lower in the scale of evolution a being is placed the more potent are the effects of the planetary influences; the higher, the wiser and the more individualized a being is, the more it is able to shape its own course and the less it will be actuated by the stellar vibrations. That is why Astrology applied to daily life helps us. It gives a knowledge of our weaknesses and the tendencies to evil in our nature; it shows us our strength and the times most opportune for development of added power for good. 

In all religions we hear of the Seven Planetary Genii: the Hindu tells of Seven Rishi, the Parsi of Seven Ameshaspentas, the Mohammedan of Seven Archangels and our Christian religion has its Seven Spirits Before The Throne. 

The modern astronomer divorces the spiritual aspect of the celestial science, Astrology, which he pooh-poohs as "an exploded superstition," from the material phase, Astronomy, counting eight primary planets (plus Pluto) in our solar system--Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury. He shows through the telescope that they exist and thinks he has proved that religion knows not whereof it speaks when it asserts that there are seven planets in the solar system. The Mystic, however, points to Bode's Law as vindicating his assertion that Neptune does not really belong to our solar system. 

The law is this: If we write a series of 4's, add 3 to the second, 6 to the third, 12 to the fourth, etc., doubling the amount added each time, the resulting series of numbers is a very close approximation to the relative distances of the planets from the Sun with the exception of Neptune. Thus, to illustrate: 

| MERCURY | VENUS | EARTH | MARS | ASTEROIDS | JUPITER | SATURN | URANUS | NEPTUNE |
|---------|-------|-------|------|-----------|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| 4       | 4     | 4     | 4    | 4         | 4       | 4      | 4      | 4       |
| ..      | 3     | 6     | 12   | 24        | 48      | 96     | 192    | 384     |
| ---     | ---   | ---   | ---  | ---       | ---     | ---    | ----   | ----    |
| 4       | 7     | 10    | 16   | 28        | 52      | 100    | 196    | 388     |

If we divide this series by 10 we get 1 for the distance of the earth from the Sun and the other numbers then represent the distances of the other planets in terms of the earth's distance. The closeness with which this simple law gives the distance is shown as follows, the column headed "Bode" being the distances according to this law, while the column headed "Distance" gives the correct values in terms of the earth's distances. 

|           | Bode | Distance |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Mercury   | 0.4  | 0.4      |
| Venus     | 0.7  | 0.7      |
| Earth     | 1.0  | 1.0      |
| Mars      | 1.6  | 1.5      |
| Asteroids | 2.8  | 2.6      |
| Jupiter   | 5.2  | 5.2      |
| Saturn    | 10.0 | 9.5      |
| Uranus    | 19.6 | 19.2     |
| Neptune   | 38.8 | 30.0     | 

It is thus seen that, with the exception of the values for Neptune, the numbers represent very nearly the relative proportional distances from the Sun, of the seven planets and the Asteroids which are within our solar system, but fail very decidedly when applied to Neptune, who is the embodiment of a Great Spirit from the Creative Hierarchies which normally influence us from the Zodiac. This planetary genius works specifically with those who are preparing for initiation and partially with those who study astrology and put it into practice in their daily lives, for then they are also preparing for the path of attainment. The twinklings of the fixed stars from without our solar system are the pulsations of spiritual impulses sent forth by the guardians of the Greater Mysteries; and the Mercurians, the Gods of Wisdom, send out similar impulses pertaining to the lesser mysteries, hence Mercury twinkles like a fixed star. Planets revolve around the Sun at varying rates of speed, the smaller planets, which are the closest to the Sun, moving much more rapidly than the larger ones which, in addition, describe wider circles.

The hourly motion of the planets in their orbits is as follows:

|         |     | MILES   |
|---------|-----|--------:|
| Mercury | ... | 104,000 | 
| Venus   | ... | 77,000  | 
| Earth   | ... | 65,000  | 
| Mars    | ... | 53,000  | 
| Jupiter | ... | 29,000  |
| Saturn  | ... | 21,000  |
| Uranus  | ... | 15,000  |
| Neptune | ... | 12,000  |

Besides revolving in their orbits around the Sun, the planets also revolve upon their axes in the same direction as they revolve in their orbits; that is, from west to east. This movement is called the Diurnal Rotation. 

The time occupied by the diurnal rotation of the planets is as follows: 

|          |     |  HOURS  |
|----------|-----|--------:|
| Mercury  | ... | 24 1/4  | 
| Venus    | ... | 23 1/2  | 
| Earth    | ... | 24      | 
| Mars     | ... | 24 1/2  |
| Jupiter  | ... | 10      |
| Saturn   | ... | 10 1/2  |
| Uranus   | ... | 9 1/2   |
| Neptune  | ... | Unknown |

The Sun also rotates upon an axis but requires about 608 hours or 25 1-3 days to complete one rotation. 

The axis of a planet may be either perpendicular or oblique to its orbit. The present approximate inclinations of the axes are as follows: 

|          |     | DEGREES |
|----------|-----|--------:|
| Jupiter  | ... | 3       | 
| Earth    | ... | 23 1/2  | 
| Mars     | ... | 25      | 
| Saturn   | ... | 26      | 
| Venus    | ... | 60      |
| Mercury  | ... | 72      |
| Uranus   | ... | 102     |
| Neptune  | ... | 155     |

The inclination of the axis of the Sun to the plane of the ecliptic is about 7 1/2 degrees. 

The above inclinations of the axes do not in all cases coincide with the figures given by physical science, neither do we endorse their view that these inclinations remain practically unchanged, save for a slight vibratory movement called Nutation. There is an exceedingly slow third movement of the planets whereby that which is now the North Pole of the earth will in the future, as it has in the past, point directly towards the Sun. Later it will be in the position where now the South Pole is, and in due time it will reach again its present place. Thus tropical climate and glacial epochs succeed each other on all points of each planet. 

In addition to this gradual movement of about 50 seconds of space per century, whereby a whole revolution of the earth's axis is completed in about two and one-half million years, there have also been sudden changes at a time when that which is now the North Pole pointed directly towards the Sun. The southern hemisphere was then continually in darkness and cold. 

Resulting conditions caused a sudden overtopping of our globe the last time. Since that time, however, the Spirit which previously guided the earth from without has drawn into the sphere and such a happening will be impossible in the future. 

Mr. Pierre Bezian, a French mechanician, has constructed an apparatus demonstrating this third movement. He is said to have received his idea from a study of the teachings promulgated among various ancient people by priests possessed of mystic learning, particularly from the Egyptians. He shows how such a third movement will account for the tropical flora and fauna found in the frozen North, which can be accounted for in no other way. He also shows that when in the course of this third movement in the inclination of a planet's axis becomes greater than 90 degrees and its North Pole commences to point toward the south, the satellites of that planet will seem to turn in the opposite direction from the satellites of the other planets, as is the case with Uranus and Neptune's satellites; a fact which astronomers are puzzled to explain. 

On Uranus and Neptune the Sun also rises in the west and sets in the east for the same reason: the inversion of their poles. 

As a last difference between the teachings of modern science and the Western Wisdom Teaching of the Rosicrucians, we may note that astronomers of today speak of Venus and Mercury as inferior planets because they always appear close to the Sun; Venus is seen only as a morning or an evening star; Mercury is rarely seen because it keeps so close to the Sun. 

The other planets are called superior because they are seen at all distances from the Sun, being even at the very opposite point of the horizon from the Sun. 

This appellation, inferior and superior, the mystic would reverse, for him it is clear that the Sun is the embodiment of the highest spiritual intelligence in our system. At the beginning of our present phase of evolution all that is now outside the Sun was inside, but not all beings could continue to vibrate at the immense rate which obtained there; some fell behind, crystallized and, in time, became a clog on other classes. They started to crystallize at the pole, where motion is slow, but gradually their increased weight brought them to the equator, where motion is most rapid, and they were thrown off from the Sun by centrifugal force. 

Later, other beings failed to keep up the vibratory movement, lagged behind, and were thrown off at a proper distance so that the solar vibrations may give them the rapidity necessary to their development. 

The most advanced spirits stayed longest with the Sun and consequently, if the appellation inferior and superior is to be applied at all, it should be used in reverse manner. 

In order to avoid all misunderstanding, it may be well to state that Jupiter was thrown off and given its enormous bulk of fiery substance because the Jupiterians had arrived at a very high state of development, where they needed both high vibrations and independent motion. Jupiter is therefore in some aspects an exception to the rule; a case where a higher law supersedes a lower. 

In conclusion we reiterate that the planets in our solar system are the visible embodiments of the Seven Spirits before the Throne of God, the Sun, and that just as it is possible to us to transmit by wireless telegraphy the force which moves the telegraph key, lights a lamp, pulls a lever, etc., so may these Great Spirits exercise an influence upon human beings in proportion to our stage of individuality. If we aim to act in harmony with the laws of Good, we rise above all other laws and become a law unto ourselves; co-workers with God and helpers in nature. Ours is the privilege, ours the loss, if we fail to live up to our highest possibilities. 

Let us therefore, strive to know, that we may do, and, above all let us beware of prostituting the science of the stars to the gutter of fortune-telling. Gold of Mammon may be ours if we do, but the "peace of God which passeth all understanding" will bring us lasting joy if we use our knowledge in unselfish service to others. 

### <h3 id="chapter-2">CHAPTER II: TIME AND PLACE AS FACTORS IN CALCULATION OF THE HOROSCOPE</h3>

A Horoscope is simply a chart of the heavens showing a certain position of the planets and zodiacal signs relative to each other and the earth. The constellations remain in the same position one to another, and are therefore called "fixed stars," but the earth and other planets constantly change. They do not return to the same relative position until after about twenty-six thousand years. Thus every scientifically calculated horoscope is absolutely individual and shows a stellar influence different from that exerted in any other life commenced at a different time. Because of the revolution of the earth upon its axis a new degree of the zodiac rises every four minutes and thus even the horoscopes of twins may differ considerably. The student will therefore realize the importance of time as a factor in casting a horoscope. There are, however, various methods of approximating the time and erecting a correct horoscope for those who do not know the hour of their birth, but that subject belongs to an advanced grade of this study. 

Time is not the same world over, however. When the Sun rises where we live, it sets in another place, and that makes another difference in the horoscopes even if cast for children born at the same moment of time but in opposite parts of the world, for if it were noon in the birthplace of one, the Sun would be high in the heavens above the earth, and in the birthplace of the other child it would be midnight with the Sun directly below the earth. We know that the chemical effect of the solar ray varies with its position, and when the change is physically noticeable, the spiritual effect must also differ. It is therefore evident that time and place are basic factors in calculation of the horoscope. We shall first show how to locate the place of birth, then we take up the matter of time. 

#### <h4 id="place">PLACE</h4>

Geographically, the earth is divided by two imaginary sets of circles. One circle runs east and west, halfway between the North and South Poles as shown in the accompanying charts: it is called the Equator. Other circles called Parallels of Latitude, are imagined running parallel to the Equator, and their use is to measure the distance of any place North or South of the Equator. Now get an atlas and look at the map of North America. Along the right and left hand borders you will see certain numbers. Note that a curved line runs from No. 50 on the right to No. 50 on the left. That is the fiftieth parallel of latitude. All cities along that line, in America, Europe or Asia are equidistant from the Equator, and said to be located in "Latitude 50 North." 

Another line runs from number 40 on the left border to number 40 on the right. Let us note some of the principal cities on or near this line. San Francisco is a little further south, Denver right on the line, Chicago and New York a trifle north. Now turn to the map of Europe. There the right and left hand numbers with their connecting circles are also latitudes, and at the number 40 you will see Lisbon and Madrid. Proceeding eastwards Rome and Constantinople appear a little to the north of our line. 

These places may be said, for the purposes of elementary instruction, to be in the same degree of latitude, and therefore another determinator must be used to differentiate the location of each place from all others. 

This is accomplished by dividing the earth longitudinally from pole to pole by another set of imaginary circles called Meridians of Longitude, and shown in our chart. All places along such circles have noon at the same instant, regardless of how far they are from the Equator, or whether near the North or South Pole. 

Now look again at your map of Europe. There you will see numbered lines running from the top of the map to the bottom. These are the lines of longitude. One is numbered 0. If you follow that line you will find London, and close thereto a place called Greenwich. That is the location of the world's greatest observatory, and for purposes of astronomical calculation all places on earth are considered as being so and so many degrees west or east of Greenwich. 

Thus, by Latitude we obtain the location of a certain place north or south of the Equator. 

By Longitude we designate its position east or west of Greenwich. 

When the location of a place is stated in terms of latitude and longitude it marks a certain spot beyond all possibility of confusion with any other place, and gives the astrologer one of the primal factors necessary to calculate a scientific horoscope--place. 

Latitude is the principal factor in locating the signs of the zodiac by means of "Tables of Houses," which apply to all places in a certain degree of latitude. These tables are as nearly unchangeable as the fixed stars to which they apply; they remain the same from year to year, at least the change is so small as to be unappreciable in a lifetime. 

Longitude is the prime factor in all calculations connected with the movable planets. To calculate their places at the time of a person's birth it is necessary to have an astronomical almanac for the year of birth. This is called an Ephemeris because it records the ephemeral or momentary position of the planets as seen from the observatory at Greenwich each day at noon. 

#### <h4 id="time">TIME</h4>

A Solar Day is the period of time it takes the Sun to move from any certain meridian of longitude till it returns to the same meridian the next day. Owing to the variable motion of the earth in its orbit, and the obliquity of the ecliptic, the Sun's path, the solar days are not all of equal length, but as the purposes of social and civil life require a uniform division an average is struck of all solar days in a year, and this is called a Mean Solar Day. It commences at midnight when the Sun is at the nadir. Clocks are regulated to show its beginning and end, also its equal divisions into twenty-four hours. There is thus a difference between sun-time and clock-time. 

From the time when the Sun is nearest to the earth (perihelion) December 24th, to the time when it is farthest from the earth (aphelion) June 21st, clock-time is in advance of sun-time. From June 21st to December 24th, the Sun is in advance of the clock, the greatest difference being 16 minutes in the beginning of November. 

When the unequal motion of the earth in its orbit and the obliquity of the ecliptic act together, the difference between sun-time and clock-time is greatest; but four times a year, April 15th, June 15th, September 1st and December 24th, they agree. 

A Sidereal Day is the time which elapses between a fixed star's leaving a certain degree of longitude until it returns to it the following day. This is the exact time of one complete revolution of the earth upon its axis; it is the only absolutely uniform motion observed in the heavens, having undergone no change since the earliest observations on record. 

Owing to the motion of the earth in its orbit about the Sun a Solar day is longer than a Sidereal day, for as the Sun moves farther to the east during the time of the earth's daily rotation on its axis, the earth must turn further upon its axis before a certain meridian comes in line with the Sun. The solar day is therefore about four minutes longer than the sidereal day, but owing to the variable motion of the earth in its orbit and the obliquity of the ecliptic previously mentioned, this difference also varies each day. 

In bygone days clocks in each city or hamlet differed from the timepieces of every other place because all were set to local time, but this caused much confusion to the traveling public; therefore America adopted what is called Standard Time on November 18, 1883. For persons born subsequent to that date a correction is necessary to convert the time shown by clocks to True Local Time, for that is the time used to calculate the horoscope. The diagram will aid students to understand what Standard Time is, how it overcame confusion, and how the before-mentioned correction is made. 

It was suggested, that if the country be divided into time-zones each about fifteen degrees of longitude in width (this being the distance the Sun travels in one hour), and all the clocks in each division set to one uniform time, gauged by a meridian located in the middle of the resulting time-zone, confusion of travelers would be avoided. 

Accordingly America was divided into four such zones by three imaginary lines, as illustrated in the diagram. 

In the Eastern Time Zone clocks are set true to the 75th meridian, 5 hours earlier than Greenwich Mean Time. 

In the Central Time Zone time is regulated to the 90th meridian which is 6 hours earlier than Greenwich. 

In the Mountain Time Zone timepieces are governed according to the 105th meridian, 7 hours earlier than Greenwich Mean Time. 

In the Pacific Time Zone time is standard to the 120th meridian, 8 hours earlier than Greenwich. 

(There is a fifth zone in the far East, comprising Maine, Nova Scotia, etc. This zone we omitted in order that our diagram might be larger.) 

In all cities located on these Standard Meridians (see diagram on the opposite page), such as Philadelphia and Denver, Standard Time is also true local time, and no correction is required in calculation of horoscopes. But Detroit, which you will see located on the dividing line between the Eastern and Central Time Zones, is 7 degrees east of the 90th meridian, and its clocks are therefore 28 minutes slow in actual fact, for when they show noon, according to the 90th meridian standard, the true local time is 28 minutes past twelve. Chicago you will see a little east of the 90th meridian (2 degrees). When the clocks there are twelve noon it is really 12:08. San Francisco clocks show noon when the true local time is only 11:50, because that city is 2 1/2 degrees west of the Standard Meridian. Correction is therefore necessary. The rule for obtaining the true local time is: 

NOTE: Detroit adopted Eastern Standard Time, May 15, 1915 

To the nearest Standard Meridian Time, add four minutes for each degree the birth place is east of the Meridian corresponding to that Time. 

If the birth place is west of the Meridian, subtract four minutes for each degree it is West thereof. 

When a child is born the exact moment it draws its first breath should be noted, as that moment and not the time of delivery is the time of birth from the astrologer's point of view. 

The reason for taking the time of the first inspiration, usually accompanied by a cry, as the moment of birth, is that the chemical condition of the atmosphere changes at each moment as the vibrations from the stars change. We note such a change in the atmosphere according to the position of the Sun in the sky at different hours of the day or night. The night air is different from the atmosphere at noon. These are not sudden changes, but are brought about by, to us, imperceptible degrees. We who are more callous from continued changes do not feel them, but the little sensitive form of a new-born child is eminently susceptible to the inrush of that first charge of its lungs, and as the oxygen contained therein surges through the body, by mixture with the blood every single atom receives a peculiar stamp which is retained all through life, although atoms change, in the same way that a scar perpetuates itself on the body despite the change of atoms. That first stamping is the physical basis of the idiosyncrasies and temperamental characteristics which cause each of us to act differently under the same stellar conditions; it is the basis of the tendencies of our physical nature and in harmony with our stage of attainment as required by the law of causation, which gives us in each life the faculties evolved during all our previous existences. Thus we do not have a certain fate because we are born at a certain moment, but we have been brought to birth at the time when the stellar rays will give us the tendency to work out the fate generated in past lives. 

This distinction is very important, for it marks the difference between the view of the materialistic astrologer and the religious conception of Astrology. 

In March 1918, the U. S. Government passed the Daylight Saving Act, by which all clocks were set ahead one hour at midnight preceding the last Sunday in March and then set back one hour at midnight preceding the last Sunday in October. This Act was in force in 1918 and 1919 only. All recorded dates in the periods affected should have one hour subtracted in order to obtain Standard Time. 

### <h3 id="chapter-3">CHAPTER III: Signs and Houses</h3>

Although we are many millions of miles nearer the Sun in winter, its rays transmit less heat than in summer when we are farthest from it, and it is therefore evident that distance has no effect on transmission of heat-rays, but as the Sun rises towards the zenith, be it summer or winter, the heat increases, the greatest heat being experienced in mid-summer when sun-rays are nearest the perpendicular; it is therefore evident that the angle of the ray is the sole determinator of its influence. 

Astrology deals with planetary angles and their observed effect upon mankind; in order to determine these angles and tabulate observations, the fixed stars along the Sun's path have been divided into groups or constellations, and the heavens, as viewed from the birthplace of a child have been divided into houses. Most beginners find it very confusing to differentiate between these signs and houses, but if it is kept in mind that the signs are divisions of the heavens relative to the vernal equinox, and houses are divisions of the heavens relative to the birthplace, there should be no difficulty. The signs influence certain parts of the body; houses govern conditions of life. 

Like any other circle, the zodiac is divided into 360 degrees, each of the twelve signs is therefore 30 degrees. Their names and symbols are given in the affixed diagram. The parts of the body ruled by those signs are as follows: 

|             |     |                       |
|-------------|-----|-----------------------|
| ARIES       | ... | HEAD                  |
| TAURUS      | ... | CEREBELLUM AND NECK   |
| GEMINI      | ... | ARMS AND LUNGS        |
| CANCER      | ... | STOMACH               |
| LEO         | ... | HEART AND SPINAL CORD |
| VIRGO       | ... | INTESTINES            |
| LIBRA       | ... | KIDNEYS               |
| SCORPIO     | ... | SEX ORGANS AND RECTUM |
| SAGITTARIUS | ... | HIPS AND THIGHS       |
| CAPRICORN   | ... | KNEES                 |
| AQUARIUS    | ... | ANKLES                |
| PISCES      | ... | FEET                  |

These twelve constellations are the Natural zodiac and ever in the same relative positions, but on account of the motion of the pole of the earth the Sun crosses the equator at a slightly different point each spring at the Vernal Equinox, and this shifting point is considered in Astrology as being the first degree of Aries, the beginning of what is called the Intellectual zodiac, which thus changes from year to year at the rate of about 50.1 seconds per annum, 1 degree in 7 years, 1 sign in 2156 years, completing the circle of 12 signs in about 25,868 years. This backward movement is called "precession of the equinox." 

From the materialistic viewpoint there seems to be no reason for this shifting of the zodiac, but from the position of the mystic it is not at all arbitrary, but necessary and in harmony with the spiral path of evolution adhered to in both star and starfish, observable everywhere in nature. After completion of each cycle, the intellectual and the natural zodiacs agree (the last time A. D. 498), then a new world period commences, a new phase of evolution, a higher loop of the spiral whereon we are ever traveling towards God. Even from the material standpoint it is evident that the spiral path of the solar system observed by astronomers must change the angle of incidence of the light rays from the fixed stars, and as the angle of incidence of the Sun's rays upon our earth has the effect of producing the climatic changes of summer and winter, it is reasonable that a similar change must follow from our altered position relative to the fixed stars, which may account for gradual changes of conditions such as that the winters grow less cold and the summers less warm in certain parts of the world. 

Furthermore, it has been observed that climatic conditions have a distant effect on our temperament--we feel differently in summer than we do in winter--and may not this slow change relative to the fixed stars account for the change in humanity, which is called evolution? The mystic affirms that it does. As rays of the Sun, by change of the angle of incidence, call forth leaves and flowers from the plant at one time, and at another cause them to wither, so do rays from the fixed stars call forth and produce greater changes in flora and fauna; they are responsible for the rise and fall of nations and the temperamental change which we call civilization. 

Bringing the analogy a step further, the natural zodiac is composed of the constellations as they are and remain in the heavens, and the Intellectual zodiac commences at the changing point where the Sun crosses the equator at the vernal equinox. That is the time when Nature brings to birth that which has germinated in her womb during the preceding winter. Thus the horoscope of the world changes from year to year. "As above, so below," is the law of analogy and the same salient points are observable in the evolution of man and microbe, star and starfish. 

In the human map we have also what may be called a natural horoscope, that is the figure as cast by the rules of Astrology, where any sign may be on the Ascendant, or First House. The changing vernal equinox corresponds to the first degree of Aries, in the intellectual zodiac, so the Ascendant in any human horoscope also has an influence corresponding to that degree. The Second House corresponds to Taurus, the Third to Gemini, and so on, forming the counterpart of the intellectual zodiac in the human horoscope. 

As the rays of the Sun are intensified when focused through a lens, so is the spiritual life of the Sun when focused through the two houses of Mars to bring a life from the unseen world. 

Cancer, the first of the watery signs was pictured among the ancient Egyptians as a scarab (beetle), which was their emblem of the soul, and occultists know that the seed-atom of the body is planted when the Sun of Life, (the Ego,) is in Cancer, the sphere of the Moon, the planet of fecundation. 

Four months later, when the Sun of Life passes through the second of the watery signs, Scorpio, which is under the rulership of Mars, the planet of passion and emotion, the Silver Cord is tied which binds the desire body to the lower vehicles, and we have the 'quickening' when the fetus first beings to show sentient life. By that time the Ego has dissolved the nucleated blood corpuscles through which the mother's life manifested in the growing organism, and it can then begin to work in the vital fluid and manifest signs of separate life in the body until the Sun of Life has completed its circle and again reaches the mystic Eighth House. 

Eight months after the seed atom was sown the Sun of Life, the Spirit, enters Pisces, the last of the watery signs in the mystic zodiac, which is under the expansive, benefic ray of Jupiter. Under this benevolent influence the waters of parturition swell and burst the restraining walls of the womb, when the nine months of gestation have been completed, launching the new-born soul upon the Ocean of Life at the first point of Aries, where it is warmed and cheered by the combined rays of Mars and the Sun, which are sign and exaltation rulers. Thus it is prepared for the battle of existence by the energetic war-god, and its fountain of life, be it large or small, is filled to capacity by the Sun, from the great cosmic reservoir of vital energy. 

#### <h4 id="the-houses">THE HOUSES</h4>

In a horoscope the birthplace is always supposed to be the highest point on the earth. It is designated by an arrow on the diagram herewith and the point right above it in the sky is called the Midheaven. As an observer in the northern hemisphere must always look south to see the noonday Sun, it follows that east is to the left an west on his right. Astrologers call the eastern horizon the Ascendant, because at that point the stars rise or ascend towards the Midheaven, and for the reverse reason they call the western horizon the Descendant. Rays from stars located at these extreme points would strike the birthplace at different angles, hence their influence would vary an there would also be a noticeable difference of effect at intermediate points between the Horizon and Midheaven, besides, the planets that have descended below the earth have also power, though not to the same extent as when above the birthplace. The influence of planets on various departments of life has been observed to be as follows: 

FIRST HOUSE - The shape and condition of the body, early environment and childhood's home. 

SECOND HOUSE - Finance. 

THIRD HOUSE - Literature, the useful arts, practical intelligence, short journeys, brothers and sisters. 

FOURTH HOUSE - The home and conditions in old age. 

FIFTH HOUSE - Amusement, courtship, children and speculation. 

SIXTH HOUSE - Health, servants and labor. 

SEVENTH HOUSE - Partnership, marriage, the fine arts and the public. 

EIGHTH HOUSE - Inheritance, death. 

NINTH HOUSE - Religion, philanthropy, idealism, justice and long journeys. 

TENTH HOUSE - Profession, social position and ambition. 

ELEVENTH HOUSE - Friends, hopes and wishes. 

TWELFTH HOUSE - Prisons, hospitals, sorrow and trouble. 

### <h3 id="chapter-4">CHAPTER IV: THE RISING SIGN AND THE TWELVE HOUSES</h3>

To illustrate how a horoscope is cast, we will first cast four horoscopes for persons born in Chicago, August 2, 1909, at 2:15 A.M., 8:15 A.M., 2:15 P.M., and 8:15 P.M., as far as the placing of the signs upon the cusps of the houses. The cusps are the dividing lines between the houses. 

Finding Chicago on the map, we note that it is located near the 42nd degree of the North latitude, and close to 88 degrees of longitude West from Greenwich. 

Our first concern is to find the True Local Time of Birth. We first turn to the rule on page 22 which says "to the nearest Standard Meridian Time, add four minutes for each degree the birth place is east of the Meridian corresponding to that Time. 

If the birth place is west of that Meridian, subtract four minutes for each degree it is West thereof. 

The nearest Standard Meridian Time is Central Time gauged by the 90th meridian. Chicago, being 88 degrees West Longitude, is two degrees East of the 90th meridian. We therefore add two times four, or eight minutes, to the time shown by the clock, in order to find true local time. In the case of the first birth hour, when the clock showed 2:15 A.M. on August 2nd., the true local time is thus found to be 2:23 A.M. This True Local Time of Birth will be used in all subsequent calculation of the horoscope. Note, however, that this correction of Standard to Local Time applies only to the United States, and is required only for dates subsequent to Nov. 18th, 1883, when standard time was adopted. (See footnote, page 32.) 

NOTE: Some foreign countries have adopted Standard Time, but information about this must be obtained in each case from the country in question.

We will now proceed to find the sidereal time (abbreviated to S.T.) at the birth place at the moment of birth. As a starting point for our calculations we have the S.T. (sidereal time) for Greenwich at noon. From that we may calculate the sidereal time at the birth-place and hour by the following rule: 

To the sidereal time for the noon previous to birth (given in the ephemeris) add-- 

First, 10 seconds correction for every 15 degrees of longitude the birth-place is west of Greenwich. 

Second, the interval between the previous noon and birth. 

Third, 10 seconds correction for every hour of this interval. 

Following the above rule we turn to the page of ephemeris in the back of this book and find the column marked Sidereal Time. As our first birth hour is August 2nd, 2:23 A.M., true local time, we note that the previous noon is August 1st. Opposite that date we note the sidereal time as being 8 hours 37 minutes, which we put down thus: 

|                                                                                                                                   | H. | M. | S. |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---:|---:|---:|
| S.T. at Greenwich for noon previous to birth . . . .                                                                              |  8 | 37 |  0 |
| Correction for 10 seconds for each 15 deg. W. Long. of birthplace.                                                                |  0 |  0 | 59 |
| Interval between the previous noon (Aug. 1st) and the time of birth (Aug. 2nd, 2:23 A.M.)                                         | 14 | 23 |  0 |

| S.T. at the birthplace on the birth-hour                                                                                          | 23 |  3 | 23 |

When the birthplace is located in East longitude, correction for longitude is subtracted. In case standard time is not used in the country of birth (see footnote page 32), the given time of birth is assumed to be True Local Time, and no correction for standard time is made. Had the child been born August 2nd at 2:15 A.M., in latitude 42 north, but in longitude 88 East, the S.T. would be figured as follows: 

|                                                                                                                                   | H. | M. | S. |

|                                                                                                                                   | -- | -- | -- |
|                                                                                                                                   |  8 | 36 |  1 |

| Correction of 10 seconds each hour of interval from previous noon to birth                                                        |  0 |  2 | 22 |

| S.T. at birthplace, at birth-hour                                                                                                 | 22 | 53 | 23 |

As the Houses are governed by latitude, the same table of Houses is used as for the child born in Chicago. 

With this S.T. we turn to the table of Houses for the latitude of the birthplace, 42 degrees. There we search the various columns marked Sidereal Time for our S.T. at birth: 23-3-23. The one nearest to that is 23-4-46. In line with that sidereal time will be found the various degrees of the signs to be placed in our horoscope. 

In the first column under latitude 42N. opposite the sidereal time 23-4-46, we observe the figure 15; at the top of the column we find the sign Pisces, and above that the figure 10, which means that the 15th degree of Pisces is to be placed on the 10th cusp, as done in the accompanying horoscope. 

In the next column, in line with our sidereal time, we see the figure 20, at the top is the sign Aries, above that the figure 11, meaning that 20 degrees of Aries is to be placed on the 11th cusp. 

In the third column, in line with our sidereal time, is the figure 1. Taurus and 12 are at the head of the column but beneath that is Gemini signifying that 1 degree of Gemini is to be placed on the 12th cusp. 

The wide column marked Ascendant comes next. There we find the figures 8:10 in line with our sidereal time, and the sign Gemini at the top, but we disregard that sign because the sign Cancer is placed between our line and the top and we always take the first sign above our line. Therefore we place Cancer 8:10 on the Ascendant. 

Proceeding along the figures in our line we note the figure 27 in the first column to the right of the wide column. At the top is the sign Cancer again and the figure 2. Accordingly we place the 27th degree of Cancer on the cusp of the Second House. 

In the extreme right hand column we find the figure 19, the sign Leo and the figure 3 at the top of the column. Therefore we place the 19th degree of Leo on the Third Cusp. 

We have thus obtained figures for six of our houses, the six opposite houses are given the opposite signs and degrees. 

Having Pisces 15 on the Tenth House, we place the opposite degree Virgo 15 on the Fourth Cusp, which is opposite the Tenth. 

Aries 20 on the Eleventh House is the opposite of Libra 20 placed on the Fifth Cusp. 

Sagittarius 1 placed on the Sixth Cusp forms an exact opposite to Gemini 1 on the Twelfth House. 

The Ascendant is opposite the Seventh Cusp and Capricorn 8:10 placed there is the opposite of Cancer 8:10 on the Ascendant. 

Cancer 27 on the Second House will be properly opposed by Capricorn 27 on the Eighth House, and Aquarius 19 placed on the Ninth is in opposition to Leo 19 on the Third. 

Now all the cusps are filled, but on account of the inclination of the earth's axis some of the signs may be Intercepted between two cusps, therefore it is necessary to see if all the twelve signs are in our horoscope before proceeding further. Counting from Aries, we note the presence of Gemini. Taurus is missing, and we therefore place it in its proper position between Aries and Gemini. 

When a certain sign is intercepted, its opposite also will be missing. We may, therefore, at once place Scorpio in its proper position between Libra and Sagittarius. 

It will now be found that all the twelve signs are placed in our horoscope, Cancer and Capricorn each occupying two cusps. It is finished as far as placing the signs in their proper positions relative to the houses, and that is as far as we will proceed at the present time, so we will leave this horoscope and calculate one for a person born six hours later in the same place: Chicago, August 2, 8.15 A.M. 

We first have to find the True Local Time of Birth. As before, we add eight minutes to the time shown by the clock, namely 8:15 A.M. This gives us 8:23 A.M. which is the True Local Time of Birth. 

Our rule for finding the Sidereal Time at the birth hour and place requires that we note the-- 

```

```

As there can be only twenty-four hours in a day, we subtract 24 where necessary, and work with the remainder, in this case 5-4-23 which was the true Sidereal Time in Chicago at the birth. This time, or the nearest thereto, we accordingly seek in the Table of Houses for the latitude of Chicago, 42 degrees N. 

The nearest time is 5-3-29, and in line with that we find the degrees for the various cusps of our houses. In the column next to the right of the Sidereal Time is the figure 17. At the top of the column the sign Gemini and the figure 10. We therefore place the 17th degree of Gemini on the Tenth Cusp. 

In the next column to the right is the figure 21. At the top of the column, the sign Cancer and the figure 11, so we place the 21st degree of Cancer on the Eleventh Cusp. 

The next right hand column has the figure 22. At the top is the sign Leo and the figure 12, so we place the 22nd degree of Leo on the Twelfth House. The large column marked Ascendant has the sign Virgo and the figures 18:56 are in our line, so we place Virgo 18:56 on the Ascendant, or First House, of our figure. 

In the first column to the right of the wide column we note the figure 14. We not also that the sign Libra is above our line before we come to the top of the column, and we therefore disregard the sign found there, but note that figure 2, which indicates that the Second Cusp is occupied by the 14th degree of Libra. 

In the extreme right hand column we find the figure 13 and also a sign before we come to the top of the column, the sign Scorpio, so we place the 13th degree of Scorpio on the Third Cusp. 

Now we have placed signs on the six houses, and we proceed to put in the six opposite signs on the opposite houses as before: Opposite Gemini 17 on the Tenth House we place Sagittarius 17 on the Fourth House. Opposite Cancer 21 on the Eleventh we place Capricorn 21 on the Fifth. Opposite Leo 22 on the Twelfth we place Aquarius 22 on the Sixth. Opposite Virgo 18:56 on the Ascendant we place Pisces 18:56 on the Seventh. Opposite Libra 14 on the Second place Aries 14 on the Eighth, and opposite Scorpio 13 on the Third, place Taurus 13 on the Ninth House. 

Now all the cusps of the horoscope are filled, and we start to count the signs to see if they are all present or if it is necessary to put in any that may be intercepted. We commence our count at Aries, and find that all twelve signs are represented, and it is therefore at a stage of completion where we decide to leave it for the present. 

We next proceed to cast the horoscope for a person born at Chicago, August 2, at 2:15 P.M. We find that the PREVIOUS noon is August 2nd and so we start our calculations as follows: 

```

Turning to our Tables of Houses for latitude 42N., we find the nearest S.T. to be 11-4-46. 

In the first column under latitude 42N. is the figure 15; the sign Virgo and the figure 10 are at the top of the column. Therefore we place 15 degrees of Virgo on the Tenth Cusp. 

The second column has the figure 16, Libra and the figure 11 at the top, so 16 degrees of Libra is placed on the Eleventh House. 

The figure 10 is in the third column, and the sign Scorpio between our line and the top, therefore we disregard the sign at the top, but note the figure 12, and accordingly place 10 degrees of Scorpio on the Twelfth House. 

In the wide column we see the figures 29:16, which we place on the Ascendant with the sign Scorpio found at the head of the column. 

The column to the right of the wide column contains the figure 1, with the sign Capricorn above and at the top is the figure 2. Therefore we put Capricorn 1 on the Second Cusp. 

The extreme right hand column shows the figure 8, the sign Aquarius above and the figure 3 at the head of the column. Accordingly we place the 8th degree of Aquarius on the Third House. 

Now our six cusps are filled, and we proceed to place the opposite signs and degrees on the other six cusps as described in detail in connection with the first two horoscopes. When that has been done we count our signs from Aries to see if all are represented. That brings out the fact that Gemini and Sagittarius are missing., so we insert them in their proper places--Gemini between Taurus and Cancer, Sagittarius between Scorpio and Capricorn. Our horoscope has been completed as far as the signs and houses are concerned, therefore we leave it for the present to cast the last of our four experimental maps for a person born in Chicago, August 2, 1909, at 8:15 P.M. True Local Time of Birth is 8 minutes later or 8:23 P.M. 

As before, we note the-- 

```
                                                        H. M. S.

(Aug. 2nd). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     8 41

Sidereal Time at birthplace at the birth hour. . . . .  17  6 23
```

With this sidereal time we turn to the tables of Houses for the latitude of birthplace, 42N., and find the nearest S.T. to be 17-7-49. 

In the first column under latitude 42N. we find 18. At the top of the column, Sagittarius and the figure 10, therefore we place Sagittarius 18 on the Tenth Cusp. 

The second narrow column shows the figure 9. Capricorn is above and the figure 11 is at the top of the column, so we place Capricorn 9 on the Eleventh Cusp. 

The third narrow column has the figure 2 with Aquarius above and the figure 12 at the head of the column, so we place Aquarius 2 degrees on the cusp of the Twelfth House. 

In the wide column are the figures 7:8, Pisces above and Ascendant at the top, so we place 7:8 of Pisces on the Ascendant. 

To the right of the wide column we find the figure 25; Aries and 2 are at the top, so we place Aries 25 on the Second Cusp. 

The extreme right hand column has the figure 26 and Taurus is at the top with the figure 3. Accordingly we place Taurus 26 on the Third Cusp. 

Having thus filled the six cusps, we proceed to fill the six opposite houses with the opposite signs. 

Gemini 18 on the Fourth in opposition to Sagittarius 18 on the Tenth. Cancer 9 on the Fifth in opposition to Capricorn 9 on the Eleventh, and so on. When all the cusps have been filled we count the signs and find that all twelve are present, hence our horoscope has reached the same stage of completion as the ones previously cast. 

These horoscopes of four children born in the same city (Chicago) on the same day and year (Aug. 2, 1909) but at different hours, show graphically that people may be, and are, born under all the twelve signs anywhere on any day of the year. 

When we compare the four horoscopes we have cast we may learn several important lessons. In the first place, we may see the worthlessness of the statements so often heard; "I was born under Taurus," or "I was born under Scorpio," which simply means that the person was born in May or November when the Sun was in the signs mentioned. Such a statement at once exposes the one who so expresses himself as being ignorant of the science of Astrology and reveals the fact that if he has had a horoscope cast, it has been done by an incompetent astrologer. These sometimes advertise to cast a horoscope "telling your fortune from the cradle to the grave" for a very small sum. But a conscientious astrologer cannot give a simple delineation of character without spending at least an hour in calculation and close concentration and to make predictions covering a whole life would require days of arduous work. The scientific astrologer may speak of a person as having Taurus or Scorpio rising, and that statement at once shows that a calculation has been made taking into consideration year, month, day, hour, and place, making the horoscope cast absolutely individual; while the other type of horoscope (?) is determined solely from the month when a person was born, without regard to day, hour or even year. 

If a horoscope could be cast by such a method or, rather, lack of method, there would be only twelve kinds of people on earth and all persons born in the same month would have the same fate. Such is manifestly not the case; in fact, there are no two people whose experiences are exactly alike, and an Astrology which does not make such a distinction cannot be a true science. 

The scientific astrologer asks first the year of birth because he knows that the planets do not come into the same relative positions more than once in a Great Sidereal Year; thus a child's horoscope cast for 1909 cannot be duplicated for 25,868 years. Next he asks the month, for upon that will depend the position of the Sun, which is in a different sign every month in the year. 

The day determines particularly the position of the Moon, which changes from one sign to another every two and one-half days; and the hour is also needful to fix its position, as it moves about 12 degrees each day. 

Yet even with these data the horoscope would lack individuality, for if a child is born every second that would mean that 3,600 people are born within the same hour. If we can bring the data to within ten minutes of the actual time of birth we should have the wherewithal to calculate a relative position of the planets such as would fit only 600 of the people on earth. If we add the last datum, place, which enables us to calculate the rising sign and degree, we shall have an absolutely individual horoscope, for it is seldom indeed that two persons are born in the same place, at the same hour and minute. Even twins are born at an interval of from twenty minutes to several hours apart, and we can readily see that a different degree would then be rising for each of the two. When the last of a sign is rising for one of the twins, the other will usually be born under the next sign. As the rising sign is one of the principal significators in molding the body, the appearance of the second twin might be totally different from the first. 

A comparison of the rising signs shows an apparent lack of uniformity in the diurnal motion of the earth. At 2:15 A.M. Cancer 8:10 is rising, while twelve hours later Scorpio 29-16 is on the Ascendant, showing that the birth place has traveled only about 141 degrees in the twelve hours involved. To complete the circle, it must travel 219 degrees in the remaining twelve hours. But as the diurnal rotation of the earth on its axis is uniform, the lack of uniformity in the motion noted above is due to its not being true diurnal motion. This condition is caused by the obliquity of the Ecliptic and the consequent unequal division of the latter by the planes separating the houses, these planes being those of the horizon and the meridian and four intermediate ones at 30 degree intervals. For this reason certain signs rise more slowly than others and are therefore called signs of long Ascension, while their opposites are called signs of Short Ascension. It will be evident from the foregoing that most people are born under the signs of long ascension,--Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius in the Northern Hemisphere, and their opposites in the Southern Hemisphere. 

### <h3 id="chapter-5">CHAPTER V: HOW TO CALCULATE THE POSITIONS OF THE PLANETS</h3>

As the Ephemeris is calculated for Greenwich at the time when the Observatory clock strikes twelve, it is necessary to make corrections for other hours and for places East or West from that point when it is desired to calculate a horoscope. 

By adding four minutes for each degree of longitude the birthplace is West of Greenwich to the true local time of birth we obtain the Greenwich Mean Time as recorded by the Observatory clock. This is written G.M.T. 

We will apply this rule to calculate the G.M.T. of the horoscope for August 2, 8:15 A.M. at Chicago, which is 88 degrees West longitude: 

```
                                                        H. M.
True Local Time of Birth (see page 38)                   8 23 A.M. Aug. 2
4 min. times 88 degrees equals 352 min.                  5 52
                                                    --------
Greenwich Mean Time (G.M.T.)...........                  2 15 P.M. Aug. 2
```

Multiplying the degree of West longitude of Chicago (88 degrees) by four minutes gives us 352 minutes, which we divide by 60 because there are 60 minutes in each hour. Thus we obtain 5 hours 52 minutes, which we add to the true local time of birth, 23 minutes after 8 in the morning, and the sum is 15 minutes past 2 o'clock in the afternoon, which is the G.M.T. 

NOTE: To find the G.M.T. when the time given is standard time, it is only necessary to add the even number of hours that the time zone of the birthplace is West of Greenwich or subtract the number that it is East of Greenwich, paying no attention to true local time, because the correction for true local time is automatically included in this method without any calculation. Beginning students, however, had best follow the method given on pages 32 and 50. 

That is to say, at the identical time when the child was born and the Chicago clocks pointed to 15 minutes after 8 o'clock in the morning, the Observatory clock at Greenwich showed 15 minutes past 2 o'clock in the afternoon. 

This latter is the time we must use to make our calculations of the planets' places, and in order to have as few factors in mind as possible the beginner is advised to forget the local time of birth when once he has found the G.M.T. 

In Western longitudes the G.M.T. may advance into the day following birth on account of the addition of 4 minutes for each degree of longitude. In the cases where the longitude of the birthplace is East of Greenwich a subtraction of 4 minutes is made for each degree; hence the G.M.T. may recede into the day preceding birth. Therefore we speak neither of birthday nor birth hour, but of the G.M.T. day and hour. 

Our concern is now to find the motion of the planets of the G.M.T. day, which is from the noon before the G.M.T. to the noon after the G.M.T. The positions of the planets are found in the ephemeris. 

As our G.M.T. is Aug. 2, 1909, at 2:15 P.M., if we desire to calculate the daily motion of the Sun we note its longitudes on the noon of Aug. 2nd (the noon before G.M.T.) and Aug. 3rd (the noon after G.M.T.). As we are to subtract we place the longitude of the planet on the last day above, for that facilitates the operation. 

```
                                                        Deg. Min.
The Sun's longitude at noon on Aug. 3rd, 1909,
(as given in the ephemeris)................               10   28
The Sun's longitude at noon Aug. 2nd..........             9   31
                                                        --------
The motion of the Sun on the G.M.T. day.......             0   57
```

The next step is to find the interval between the G.M.T. and the nearest noon, for that is also a basis of our correction. In the present horoscope the G.M.T. is Aug. 2, 2:15 P.M. The nearest moon is obviously 12 o'clock August 2nd, and the interval between 12 o'clock noon and 2:15 P.M. is therefore 2 hours and 15 minutes. 

The motion of the planet on the G.M.T. day and the interval from G.M.T. to nearest noon having been found, our problem may be thus stated: 

When the Sun moves 57 minutes of space in 24 hours, how much does it move in 2 hours and 15 minutes? Answer: 5 minutes. 

This method of working the corrections by simple proportion may be used with advantage where the motion of a planet is less than one degree; with Venus, Mercury, and particularly in the case of the Moon, it is much quicker safer and more exact to perform the correction by means of logarithms. A table of logarithms is found on the last pages of our Ephemeris for any year, also a partial table in the back of this book, and its use is exceedingly simple. 

At the top of the table is a line of figures: 0 to 23. They are for the Hours or Degrees (both being divisible into 60 minutes); on the left hand side is another column having the minute figures: 0 to 59. 

When we wish to find the logarithm of a certain number of hours and minutes we simply place our index finger upon the figure corresponding to the number of hours or degrees wanted, run it down the column till we reach the line corresponding to the minutes wanted. At that point where the line of minutes intersects the column of hours or degrees will be found the desired logarithm. 

For instance, the daily motion of the Sun in the horoscope under calculation is 0 degrees 57 minutes. We place our index finger upon the column marked 0 at the top. We run the finger down the page till we come in line with the figure 57 in the minute column. Where this line intersects the column 0 is the figure 1.4025, which is the logarithm of the Sun's motion on the G.M.T. day from noon Aug. 2, to noon Aug. 3. 

In like manner we find the logarithm of interval between G.M.T. and the nearest noon. In this case the interval is 2 hours 15 minus. Running our index finger down the column marked 2 we find the figure 1.0280 in line with the figure 15 in the minute column. That logarithm (1.0280) is the logarithm of interval. 

The daily motion of each planet differs from the daily motion of all other planets. Therefore the travel of each must be separately calculated and the logarithm of its motion found, but the interval between the G.M.T. and the nearest moon applies equally in the calculation of all the planets, so that, once the interval has been ascertained, its logarithm may be used in the calculation of all the planets' places. 

```
Continuing our calculation, we place the Logarithm
of the Sun's motion from noon Aug. 2nd
to noon Aug. 3rd (57 minutes).....................       1,4025
Plus Logarithm of interval........................       1.0280
                                                        ------
Logarithm of distance traveled by the Sun
during the interval...................................   2.4305
```

The value of that logarithm in degrees and minutes we ascertain by finding it or the logarithm nearest thereto in the table. In the present example the nearest logarithm is 2.4594. This figure is in the column marked 0 degrees at the top, and in line with the figure 5 in the extreme left-hand column which contains minutes. Therefore the value of the logarithm is 0 degrees 5 minutes. Thus we have obtained the same answer to our problem (When the Sun moves 57 minutes in 24 hours, how much does it move in 2 hours and 15 min.?) by using logarithms as we did working by proportion. The latter method may seem easier to the beginner, but once the logarithm of interval has been found the logarithmic method will be found to be easier, quicker and more exact, for the answers obtained by the two methods are not always quite identical, and particularly in the case of the Moon logarithms should be used. 

Having found the distance traveled by the planet during the interval between the G.M.T. and the nearest noon, to find the place of the planet at the G.M.T. (which is the end and aim of our calculations), we must add this increment of correction to the planet's longitude on the noon nearest to the G.M.T. day if the G.M.T. is P.M., for in that case the planet has traveled farther than shown by the ephemeris. 

If, on the other hand, the G.M.T. is in the forenoon (A.M.) the planet has not yet reached the position indicated for noon in the ephemeris, hence it will necessary to subtract the distance of travel for the interval-the increment of correction-from the planet's longitude given in the ephemeris for the noon nearest to the G.M.T. 

In the present case the G.M.T. is after noon (P.M.) so we add: 

```
Longitude of the Sun on the noon nearest the             Deg.  Min.
G.M.T., Aug. 2nd, as per ephemeris...Leo                  9    31

Increment of correction.....................                     5
                                                    --------------
                                                        9    36
```

This position will be entered in the horoscope. 

For the convenience of the student we will now enunciate the rule for finding the planets' places, in consecutive order of operation: 

First - Find the G.M.T. by adding to the local time of birth 4 minutes for each degree of longitude the birth-place is west of Greenwich (subtract for East longitude). 

Second - Find the interval between the G.M.T. and the nearest noon, also the Logarithm of Interval. 

Third - Find the planet's motion on the G.M.T. day, from the noon before the G.M.T. to the noon after the G.M.T.; find also the logarithm of that motion. 

Fourth - Add to the logarithm of interval the logarithm of the planet's motion on the G.M.T. day. 

The sum of these is the logarithm of the planet's travel during the interval. 

Fifth - Find the value of the logarithm of the planet's travel during the interval in degrees and minutes. This is the Increment of Correction. 

Sixth - (a) When the G.M.T. is before noon (A.M.) subtract the increment of correction from the planet's position on the noon nearest to the G.M.T. (b) When the G.M.T. is after noon (P.M.) add the increment of correction to the planet's longitude on the noon nearest the G.M.T. 

When planets are retrograde reverse the 6th rule. 

The result in either case will give the exact position of the planet at G.M.T., which is entered in the proper place in the horoscope. 

These rules have ALL been applied in calculating the position of one planet-the Sun-but as the G.M.T. (August 2, 2:15 P.M.) and the logarithm of interval (1.0280) are the same for all the planets we need not calculate them again as directed by Sections First and Second but commence our calculations of the Moon and planets according to Section Three: 

```
                                                        Deg. Min.
Longitude of the Moon on the noon after G.M.T.
as per the ephemeris (Aug. 3)...........      Pisces      2   39
Longitude of the Moon on the noon before G.M.T.
as per the ephemeris (Aug.2)..........      Aquarius     17   55
                                                    ------------
The Moon's motion on the G.M.T. day..............         14   44
```

The student will remember that there are 30 degrees in each sign and 60 minutes in one degree. In the foregoing subtraction it was necessary to borrow 1 degree and add its 60 minutes to 39, for only then could we subtract from the total of 99 minutes the 55 minutes required, leaving a remainder of 44 minutes. Similarly, we borrow one sign (30 degrees), adding it to the one degree of Pisces left after we borrowed the one degree to work our subtraction of the minutes. Thus we subtract 17 from 31 degrees, which leaves a remainder of 14 degrees. 

```
According to Section Four of our rule we add--
Logarithm of the Moon's motion on G.M.T. day.....     .2119
Logarithm of interval............................    1.0280
                                                    ------
Logarithm of Moon's travel in interval...........    1.2399
```

Section Five directs us to find the value of this logarithm, and in our table of logarithms we note as the nearest thereto the figure 1.2393. Above that, we see at the head of the column the figure 1; to the extreme left is the figure 23, indicating that the Moon has traveled 1 degree 23 minutes during the interval (between G.M.T. and the nearest noon). This is therefore the increment of correction. 

Section Six (b) directs that we add the increment of correction to the--

                    ........ Aquarius                   19   18

The motion of Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter on the G.M.T. day from noon August 2nd to noon August 3rd is seen by a glance at the ephemeris to have been only a few minutes. Consequently the distance they have traveled in the interval is negligible and they may be entered in the horoscope as having the longitude of the NEAREST noon to the G.M.T., August 2nd. Mars has moved 15 minutes on the G.M.T. day, and we may therefore add 1 minute for his travel during the interval to his longitude August 2nd as given in the ephemeris; so that we enter him in the horoscope as being in Aries 3:58. 

Venus will need logarithmic correction.

The position of the Dragon's Head, or Moon's Node, and the Dragon's Tail, have now to be found. The longitude of the Dragon's Head for Aug. 2nd, the noon nearest to the G.M.T., is found in the ephemeris to be 13.47 Gemini. The Dragon's Tail occupies the opposite point, namely 13.47 Sagittarius. These points are to be entered in the horoscope. 

There remains yet another factor to complete the horoscope: the Part of Fortune. This is an imaginary point calculated from the longitude of the Sun, Moon, and Ascendant. The philosophy is, that the human body is produced by the lunar forces. At the time of conception the Moon may be mathematically demonstrated to have been in the degree which is the Ascendant at birth-at birth it has a different longitude. In one of these positions the Moon may be said to have magnetized the positive pole, in the other the negative pole of the seed atom which as a magnet draws to itself the chemical substance that builds the dense body. The solar forces vitalize the body and, as it is constantly decaying, a pabulum is necessary to repair waste. That nutriment and all material possessions, are therefore, astrologically speaking, derived through the combined influences of the Sun and the before-mentioned two positions of the Moon. When the planetary aspects to this Part of Fortune are favorable material success and prosperity follow. When adverse influences center upon it, reverses are met. That nature of the aspecting planet, the sign and house it is in tell the sources whence we may expect one or the other, and thus show us where to direct our energies or what to avoid. 

The Signs of the Zodiac are counted from Aries which is the first sign, and each is thus numbered- 

```
Aries .......................... 1  Libra .........................  7
Taurus ......................... 2  Scorpio .......................  8
Gemini ......................... 3  Sagittarius ...................  9
Cancer ......................... 4  Capricorn ..................... 10
Leo ............................ 5  Aquarius ...................... 11
Virgo .......................... 6  Pisces ........................ 12
```

To find the Part of Fortune: 

Add to the longitude of the Ascendant: sign, degree and minute, the longitude of the Moon: sign, degree and minute: 

From that sum subtract the longitude of the Sun: sign, degree and minute: 

The remainder is the longitude: sign, degree and minute of the Part of Fortune. 

Applying this rule to the horoscope we are calculating, we note the factors involved in the calculation as follows: 

```
                Deg. Min.
Longitude of the Ascendant......Virgo ( 6th sign)  18  56
Longitude of the Sun..............Leo ( 5th sign)   9  36
Longitude of the Moon........Aquarius (11th sign)  19  18
```

We then follow the rule and add-- 

```
            Sign  Deg. Min.
Longitude of the Moon..................   11  19  18
Longitude of the Ascendant.............    6  18  56
                                ---------------------
                                        18   8  14
```

Subtract-- 

```
Longitude of the Sun...................    5   9  36
                            ---------------------
Longitude of the Part of Fortune          12  28  38
```

The twelfth sign is Pisces, hence the longitude of the Part of Fortune in the horoscope will be Pisces 28:38. 

In the above example the student will notice that when adding the degrees of the Moon and Ascendant: 19+18+the 1 degree carried in the addition of the minutes equals 38, but there are only 30 degrees in a sign, so one sign was carried forward and added to the other signs, the same as we add 60 minutes to degrees or hours. 

If, after subtracting the longitude of the Sun there are more than 12 signs left, we subtract the circle of 12 and work with the remainder. 

It also happens that the signs of the Sun's longitude exceed the combined longitudes of the Moon and Ascendant, so that it is impossible to perform the subtraction. For instance, if the-- 

```
            Sign  Deg. Min.
Longitude of Ascendant......................Aries  1  25 55
Longitude of the Moon.......................Aries  1  25 50
                                        -------------------
                                                3  21 45
If the Sun is in Capricorn, the 10th
sign, we cannot subtract 10 from 3 so we
Add the circle of 12 signs....................... 12  00 00
                                    --------------------
                                                15  21 45

Then we may subtract--
Longitude of the Sun............................  10  29 55
                                    --------------------
                                                4  21 50

Longitude of Part of Fortune..............    Cancer  21 50
```

In the foregoing subtraction of 55 minutes from 45 we borrowed 1 degree, 60 minutes, added that to the 45 minutes, and from their sum, 105 minutes, we subtracted 55, leaving 50 minutes. 

To subtract 29 degrees from 20 left after borrowing 1 degree for subtracting the minutes, is impossible, so we borrow one sign from the 15. That 30 degrees we add to the 20, which makes 50. From that 50 degrees we subtract 29, leaving 21 degrees. Of the 15 signs, we have borrowed 1, leaving 14, and 10 from 14 leaves 4. The fourth sign is Cancer 21:50. 

We will now make a list of the longitudes of the planets as we have figured them, prior to placing them in the horoscope: 

```
                                                    Deg.  Min.
Longitude of the Sun.................... Leo          9    36
Longitude of the Moon................... Aquarius    19    18
Long. of Neptune (noon Aug. 2).......... Cancer      17    42
Long. of Uranus (noon Aug. 2)........... Capricorn   18    15 R
Long. of Saturn (noon Aug. 2)........... Aries       23    13
Long. of Jupiter (noon Aug. 2).......... Virgo       15    10
Longitude of Mars....................... Aries        3    58
Longitude of Venus...................... Virgo        5    16
Longitude of Mercury.................... Leo          7    29
Longitude of Part of Fortune............ Pisces      28    38
Longitude of Dragon's Head.............. Gemini      13    47
Longitude of Dragon's Tail.............. Sagittarius 13    47
```

The planets may now be placed in the horoscope. 

In placing the planets the student should particular regard to two points: 

FIRST--That the planets are placed in their proper houses and order. The signs and degrees of the zodiac go in the direction shown by the arrows; consequently, starting from Aries 0 (which must be in the Seventh House, as Aries 14 is on the cusp of the Eighth House) we note that Mars is in Aries 3:58; consequently we place him in the Seventh House close to the cusp of the Eighth. As Aries 14 is on the cusp of line which marks the entrance of to the Eighth House, and Saturn is Aries 23:13, we place him in the Eighth House just above the cusp. Thus both planets are in their proper relation to one another and to the houses, and they are so placed that in reading we can make no mistake as to the sign they are in. If Mars had been placed lower down in the Seventh House, at a cursory glance he might even seem to be in Pisces, and Saturn, placed further up in the Eighth, might appear to be in Taurus. That would cause an error in reading which a little care will obviate. If the student observes carefully the method used in placing the planets in this horoscope there will never be any doubt as to the signs the planets are occupying. 

SECOND--The positions of the planets should be readable without the necessity of turning and twisting the horoscope, which is subversive of proper concentration. If planets in the Third, Fourth, Ninth and Tenth Houses are written as we have inscribed Neptune and Uranus, this inconvenience will be overcome. 

The horoscope has now been cast and is complete. Most astrologers now start to read, but to do this work thoroughly it is necessary to make an index such as will be found in a later chapter. In order to make the student thoroughly conversant with the manner of casting a horoscope we will first complete the figure cast in part for Aug. 2, 8:15 P.M., for that horoscope offers certain peculiarities worthy of illustration. 

```
To find the G.M.T. we add to the True Local
Time of Birth, Aug. 2....................    8 23 P.M.
4 min. for each of the 88 degrees longitude,
birthplace is west of Greenwich..........    5 52
            ----------------
G.M.T., August 3rd..........................  2 15 A.M.
```

Here is an important point. When we add 5 hours and 52 minutes to 8 P.M., we bring the G.M.T. into the following day; at the identical time when the child was born and the Chicago clocks pointed to 15 minutes past 8 on the evening of August 2nd, the Observatory clock at Greenwich showed 15 minutes past 2 on the morning of August 3rd. Thus the noon of August 3rd is nearest the G.M.T.. and the interval between G.M.T. (2:15 A.M.) and nearest noon is therefore 9 hours, 45 minutes, the logarithm of interval being .3912. 

We have now performed the operations prescribed in Sections One and Two of our rule and we will next find the motion of the Sun on the G.M.T. day as directed by Section Three: 

```
                                    Deg.  Min.

Long. of Sun on noon before G.M.T.
(Aug. 2)...................Leo        9    31
                                ---------------
Sun's motion on the G.M.T. day...           57

                                --------------
Log. of Sun's travel during interval    1.7937

of correction) 0 degrees, 23 minutes
Long. of Sun on noon nearest G.M.T...Leo  10    28
Minus increment of correction...........   0    23
                                ---------------
Long. of Sun at G.M.T................Leo  10     5
```

This position may be entered in the horoscope. 

In the last horoscope we added the increment of correction to the longitude of each planet because the G.M.T. was after noon. Here the G.M.T. is before noon hence we subtract the increment of correction from the longitude of each planet on the nearest noon to G.M.T. as directed by the rule Section Six (b).

```

As in the first horoscope we calculated, so in this we may pass Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn without correcting, and enter the longitude of each for the noon nearest G.M.T. in the horoscope. Mars' motion is 15 minutes on the G.M.T. day and his motion during the interval of 9 hours, 45 minutes would therefore be about 6 minutes. Subtracting 6 minutes from Mars' longitude on Aug. 3rd (the noon nearest G.M.T.), Mars' position in the horoscope will be Aries 4:06. Similarly Jupiter requires a correction of 4 minutes making his position Virgo 15.17.

```

The position of the Dragon's Head or Moon's Node, and the Dragon's Tail, have also to be found. The Dragon's Head for Aug 3rd, the noon nearest the G.M.T., is found in the ephemeris to be in 13:44 Gemini. The Dragon's Tail occupies the opposite point of 13:44 Sagittarius. 

It now remains to calculate the Part of Fortune, and we note the factors in that problem as being: 

```
                                            Deg.  Min.

Longitude of Sun, the 5th sign.......... Leo   10     5

We proceed according to the rule given:

We will now make a list of the planets as corrected for insertion in the horoscope:

```

We have now cast the two horoscopes and a comparison reveals the fact that although cast for persons born in the same city on the same day of the year, the characteristics of one of these persons will be entirely opposite to those of the other, and as character is the determinator of destiny, the lives of these two persons will be entirely opposite. 

Before we can judge these two horoscopes it is necessary that we should obtain a clear conception of the relations of the planets to one another, to the signs of the Zodiac and to the houses as they are in each of the two horoscopes, and to that end we will make an index that shall reveal these relationships at a glance, so that our minds may not be hampered by mathematics at the time when we are judging the horoscope, but be free and concentrated upon the meaning of the different aspects and positions. 

#### <h4 id="retrogradation">RETROGRADATION</h4>

On the page of our ephemeris copied in this book, you will find in the columns of Saturn and Mars a capital R. The meaning is as follows: 

The planets of our solar system move in one direction, from west to east, but their orbits about the Sun are of varying sizes, and so are their velocities. The earth travels 65,000 miles an hour and still its circle is so large that it requires 365 days to journey around the Sun. Mercury makes a much smaller circle around the Sun, and travels 104,000 miles an hour, so it completes a revolution around the Sun in 88 days. Uranus travels only 15000 miles an hour, but its circle is so large that it requires 84 years to complete. The other planets show similar variations of speed. If they traveled in a straight line the smaller and faster planets would soon leave the more ponderous and slow-moving behind, but as they move in circle, they pass a given point of observation again and again. Were that point central and stationary this constant forward motion of the planets in their respective orbits would be apparent to all observers; but that is the trouble, there is no stationary point; every particle, from Jupiter, the giant of our solar system, to the smallest particle of "stardust" is in incessant motion around a common center, and therefore, at times one planet moves almost transversely to the path of another moving body and it appears for a time as if it stood still in its orbit. Astronomers say that such a planet is stationary. At other times this oblique motion of the planets relative to the earth's position in its orbit makes them seem to move backward in the zodiac, and this we call Retrograde. In the ephemeris we find a capital R in line with the day when any planet commences thus seemingly to recede, and this retrogradation goes on until we find a capital D which indicates that a direct forward motion of the planet is again observable. 

Though this backward motion of a planet is only seeming, it has a very real effect in respect to the influence which a planet exerts, for it is the angle of the ray which determines the influence of a planet. The planets are foci which transmit and intensify the properties of fixed stars so that they affect us in a much greater degree than when not focussed upon the point of observation-the birthplace. 

Let us now suppose that at the time a child is born we look at Saturn and beyond him, right along our line of observation, we see the fixed star Antares which is in about 8 degrees of Sagittarius; the child is then getting a tendency to eye trouble which is sufficiently severe even if the planet is traveling "direct" in its orbit as is generally the case, for then Antares gradually goes out of focus, and Saturn will not return to the conjunction until it has completed its circle journey around the Sun (which takes about 29 years). If, on the other hand, we find that on the day after birth Saturn has retrograded somewhat, and still more the next day, and so on for a week or two, then that also brings Antares out of focus, but there is this important difference, that instead of taking 29 years to form the next conjunction Saturn may become "direct," and form the second conjunction with Antares in a few weeks after birth, and this repeated evil ray may aggravate the natal defect to such an extent that the child becomes blind. Thus we reiterate, that while the retrograde motion of a planet is only seeming, its influence on human affairs is very real. 

### <h3 id="chapter-6">CHAPTER VI: THE ASPECTS</h3>

The circle of the zodiac, like any other circle, is divisible into 360 degrees. Within this circle move the heavenly bodies of our solar system, but their motion is far from uniform, as shown in the first chapter. Therefore those planets which move the slowest are overtaken, passed, and re-passed by the swifter bodies. 

When one planet is a certain number of degrees from another planet they are said to be in aspect. 

#### <h4 id="table-of-aspects">TABLE OF ASPECTS</h4>

|                  |         |     |      |         |       |
|------------------|---------|-----|-----:|---------|-------|
| The Opposition   | planets | are | 180  | degrees | apart |
| The Square       |    "    | "   |   90 |   "     | "     |
| The Sextile      |    "    | "   |   60 |   "     | "     |
| The Trine        |    "    | "   |  120 |   "     | "     |
| The Conjunction  |    "    | "   |    0 |   "     | "     |

The Parallel occurs when two planets have the same degree of declination, no matter whether one is north and the other south of the equator. This will be made clear in calculations which follow later. 

Of the aspects mentioned above, the Opposition and Square are said to be evil; the Sextile and Trine are designated good, while the Conjunction and Parallel are classed as indeterminate; if they occur between so-called good planets they bring good; if between the evil planets (so-called) they bring evil. A horoscope is considered fortunate or the reverse according to whether the sextiles and trines are more numerous than the squares and oppositions. 

Such a viewpoint is erroneous. In the Father's Kingdom there is no evil. What appears so is only good in the making. When a lapidary is cutting a precious stone he applies part after part of the rough gem to the grindstone and at each application we may hear the loud screeching, as if in pain, from the stone. By degrees, however, as a consequence of the harsh grinding process, it will acquire a beautifully polished surface with numerous facets capable of receiving, reflecting and refracting the brilliant sunlight. 

God and his Ministers, the Seven Planetary Spirits, are the Lapidaries and man is a diamond in the rough. To polish and uncover his spiritual nature varied experiences are necessary. They may be pleasant or otherwise, as indicated by what are commonly called good or bad aspects; but it is safe to say that the adverse experiences which come to us under so-called bad aspects are as potent developers of spiritual muscle--removing more of our selfishness, serving to make us more tolerant and sympathetic, as the harsh grinding which serves to remove the rough coat of the diamond. Though a horoscope full of squares and oppositions may indicate what is ordinarily termed a hard life, such a one is infinitely preferable (from a spiritual standpoint) to a nativity with only "good" aspects, for that could give but an insipid existence, while a "bad" horoscope will give action and zest to the life in one direction or another. 

Moreover as the stars do not compel, but give tendencies only, it lies with us in a large measure to assert our individuality and transmute present evil to future good. Thus we shall work in harmony with the stars and rule them by obedience to cosmic law. 

The influence of an aspect between the planets at birth is felt even if they are not exactly 60, 90, 120 or 180 degrees apart; an "orb," so-called, of 6 degrees is allowed. 

In the accompanying cut Saturn and Jupiter are within orb of each other because one is 1 degree, the other 7 degrees of Aries. Saturn being 1 degree, is also within orb of Mars (3 degrees) and Mercury (5 degrees), but is not within orb of the Sun, Moon or Venus, as there are more than 6 degrees from 1 (Saturn's degree) to 9, 12 and 14, the degrees occupied by the Sun, Moon and Venus. 

The spiritual reason for this orb is as follows:--Besides the visible body of man which we perceive by our senses, man has also invisible vehicles called by Paul spiritual bodies, and man himself is a spirit. 

When we have developed the faculty of spiritual sight, which is latent in all, we shall see these finer bodies protruding far beyond the dense body which is located in the center of this "aura," much as the yolk of an egg is in the center of the egg, surrounded by the white on all sides. 

Before two human beings come in close physical contact their auras have mingled; that is the reason why we "feel the presence of another" at times before we become aware of him by means of our ordinary senses. 

As above, so below. Man is made in the image of God and of His ministers--the star angels. Each planet has an invisible world protruding into space beyond the dense visible sphere perceived by the eye. When these planetary auras come into aspect an influence is felt, though the visible planets may yet lack 6 degrees in forming an aspect or they may have gone 6 degrees past the aspect before the influence ceases. 

In order to determine at a glance just what aspect the planets in a horoscope have to one another, when within orbs we note the following division of the zodiacal signs: 

Planets in Cardinal signs are in conjunction, square or opposition if within orb, planets in Fixed signs are also in conjunction, square or opposition if within orbs and so are planets in Common signs. A glance at the horoscope will reveal which of the three aspects is formed. 

Another division of the zodiac is: 

Planets in fiery signs are in conjunction or trine if within orb. Planets in earthy signs are in trine (or conjunction); so are the planets in airy or watery signs, as shown in the above diagram. 

#### <h4 id="dignities-and-exaltation">DIGNITIES AND EXALTATION:</h4>

Planets are said to "rule" or to be "essentially dignified" in certain signs where the essential nature of planet and sign agree. When placed in the opposite signs, they are in their "detriment," and hence out of harmony with their surroundings. 

Planets are more powerful in certain signs than in others, and are said to be "exalted" when placed in such signs. When occupying the opposite signs, they are in their "fall," hence comparatively weak. 

The following table will show the planets, and the signs in which they are strong or weak, in accordance with the foregoing. It will be noted that each of the planets, with the exception of Uranus and Neptune, rules two signs, while the Sun and Moon rule only one each. Also note that Uranus and Saturn are co-rulers of Aquarius and that Neptune and Jupiter are co-rulers of Pisces. 

The following table shows certain degrees of the Zodiac which are designated as "critical degrees." When a planet is within an orb of three degrees of any of these points, it will be found to exercise a much stronger influence in the life than otherwise. This influence will tend to increase the strength of an exaltation, and also to offset the weakness resulting from a planet being in its fall or detriment. It will also increase the strength of aspects to that planet. 

#### <h4 id="of-critical-degrees">OF CRITICAL DEGREES</h4>

```
Cardinal Signs - Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn;
    1st., 13th., and 26th. degrees.

Fixed Signs -  Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius;
    9th. and 21st degrees.

Common Signs - Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces;
    4th. and 17th. degrees.
```

#### <h4 id="elevation">ELEVATION:</h4>

A planet placed in or near the ninth or tenth houses is said to be "elevated." The nearer it is to the Midheaven, the more highly elevated it is. A planet in elevation is much more powerful, for either good or evil, than when placed at a lower altitude. 

#### <h4 id="angles">ANGLES:</h4>

When planets are found in the "angles" of the horoscope (First, Fourth, Seventh and Tenth Houses) they are said to be Angular or Accidentally Dignified. When so placed, they exert a greater influence for either good or evil, than when located in the other houses. 

When the student has digested the above information he should proceed to make a table or index of the relationship of the planets as shown in the diagram on page 89. 

### <h3 id="chapter-7">CHAPTER VII: MAKING THE INDEX</h3>

Looking at the horoscope for 8:15 P.M. we note that Saturn and Mars are in Aries, a Cardinal sign. We therefore place them under Cardinal signs in the main index. Cancer, the next Cardinal sign, contains Neptune, and that planet is entered under the Cardinal signs in the main index. Libra, the third Cardinal sign, contains no planets. Capricorn is the last of the Cardinal signs; Uranus is there and when we have entered him in the index we have a complete list of the planets which, in this horoscope, are placed in Cardinal signs. 

The Fixed signs are Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius. In Taurus we find no planet. The Sun and Mercury are in Leo, hence we enter them in the index under the heading "Fixed." Scorpio has no planets but the Moon is in Aquarius. It is therefore also entered under "Fixed" in the main index. 

In this horoscope the Common signs Gemini, Sagittarius and Pisces, contain no planets, but Virgo, the other Common sign, has Jupiter and Venus; hence these are entered under the list of planets in Common signs, as is also the Part of Fortune. 

This completes our classification of the planets in respect to the temperament, and to make sure that we have entered all in the index, we count them: Four are in Cardinal; three are classified as Fixed, and two as Common, making a total of nine planets, besides the Part of Fortune. 

That is right; so we proceed in like manner to note the planets in Fiery signs. We enter them in the main index. Next the Earthy, Airy and Watery signs. We have then made our classification according to elements, and again we count to see that we have entered all the planets. Four are in Fiery signs; three in Earthy signs; one in Airy, and one in Watery signs. The total is nine planets, which is right. 

We next note the exaltation, etc., as given in the main index. 

Now we are prepared to note the aspects, and the student is particularly requested to follow the system as here outlined; then he cannot possibly miss any aspect. 

Place the index finger of the left hand upon the first or left hand planet under the heading Cardinal in the main index. (In the present case Mars.) Place your pencil point held in the right hand on the planet next to the right in the Cardinal line (Saturn here). Note by a glance at the horoscope if these two planets are in orb (6 degrees) of each other. Here the answer is, no; one is 4, the other 23 degrees. They are therefore not in aspect. Keep the left index finger in place, but move the pencil to the right to the next planet (Neptune here), and ask, are they within orb? --again the answer is no. Again the pencil point is moved to the right and is on the last planet in the Cardinal line (Uranus); the question, are the planets under the index finger and the pencil point within orb, is asked, and answered negatively. 

Thus we have ascertained that the planet under our left hand index finger (Mars) has no aspect to any of the other planets in Cardinal signs. We then move the left index finger one place to the right (to Saturn), place our pencil point on the planet next to the right of that (on Neptune here), repeat the query, are the planets under the index finger and the pencil point (Saturn and Neptune here) within orb? A glance at the horoscope shows that they are; one being 17 and the other 23. They are therefore in aspect. Our rule says that--Planets in Cardinal, Fixed or Common signs are either in conjunction square or opposition if within orbs! 

A glance at the position of Saturn and Neptune shows that they are not in conjunction; nor in opposition; they must therefore be square to each other. We therefore write a square and the symbol of Saturn in Neptune's line in the Index; also a square and the symbol of Neptune in Saturn's line. Thus we have recorded that aspect. 

We leave our left index finger on Saturn, but move the pencil point to the right, to Uranus. We repeat our query, are they in orb? The answer is yes, and their positions indicate the aspect as being a square. This we note in the lines of Saturn and Uranus as in previous cases. Then we have recorded all the aspects of Saturn to the planets to the right of him, and we move our left index finger to the right (to Neptune and Uranus) and ask our question regarding orb. The answer is yes. Neptune and Uranus are within orb of each other, hence in opposition. This aspect is entered in the index also and completes the aspects of Neptune. 

We have now noted in a thorough and systematic manner all the aspects between the planets in the Cardinal line. The same mode of procedure we employ with the planets in the other lines working in each line steadily from left to right. If this method is followed no aspect can be missed. 

In dealing with the planets in the Fiery, Airy, Earthy and Watery signs, we remember of course that they are in trine or conjunction if within orb. 

In getting the Sextiles a different method is necessary. Start with Mars (Aries 4 here), add 60 degrees, which gives Gemini 4. As, is any planet in orb of Gemini 4? The answer is no. Pass the left index finger to the next planet in the horoscope (Saturn). He is in Aries 23; adding 60 degrees gives Gemini 23. There is no planet within orb of that point. The left index finger is passed on to the next planet (Neptune) in Cancer 17. We add 60 degrees which gives Virgo 17. We ask our question, Is any planet in orb of that point? The answer is yes--Jupiter in Virgo 15. Then Neptune and Jupiter are sextile and are so entered in the lines of both planets in the main index. 

Proceeding we move the left index finger to every planet in the horoscope in turn; adding 60 degrees and asking our question. When we have followed the circle around we shall also have recorded all the sextiles and missed none. 

The Dragon's Head and the Dragon's Tail exert an influence in the horoscope only when in conjunction with a planet or the Ascendant. An orb of only two degrees or at most three degrees is allowed. The Dragon's Head is regarded as a benefic, its influence being analogous to that of the Sun in Aries, and Jupiterian in effect. The Dragon's Tail is malefic, being Saturnine in quality and having an influence similar to that of Saturn in Libra. In the present case neither the Dragon's Head nor Tail is in conjunction with a planet, hence there are no aspects to them to be entered in the main index. 

There remain yet the Parallels. To find them we turn to the page from the ephemeris for the month of birth (August) found in the back of this book. At the top of the page we find the names of the planets: Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, etc., and below each planet is noted its Declination for the days of the month given in the left hand column. 

As our G.M.T. is early morning on August 3rd we place the declinations for August 3rd opposite each planet in the main index. 

An exception is the Moon's declination which requires a logarithmic correction in accordance with the G.M.T. This correction is made by the same method used in obtaining the Moon's longitude. We thus find the Moon's declination to be 17-2. 

The declination of the Part of Fortune is the same as the declination of the Sun when in the same sign and degree. 

Here the Part of Fortune is Virgo 23:43. Take an ephemeris for any year and find when the Sun was there. That will be about September 17, and then the Sun's declination was 2:25 (ephemeris for 1909.) That, then, is the declination of the Part of Fortune. In the same way the declinations of the Midheaven and the Ascendant may be found if desired. 

Having entered all the declinations in the index, place the left index finger on the declination of Neptune at the bottom; the pencil point on the declination next above (Uranus); ask if they are within 1 degree or at most 1 1/2 degrees. The answer is yes, and so they are entered in the column of aspects as parallel. Move the pencil up the line, noting at each step if the declinations of the planets under the index finger and pencil point are within orb (one degree or a little more.) When the pencil point has reached the top, all parallels under the left index finger will have been noted. Then move the left index finger one step up (to Uranus) and the pencil point up to the declination of the planet next above; note their parallel, if any; move the pencil point upward, step by step, following the same method in moving from bottom upward to get the declination as was followed by moving the index finger and pencil point from left to right to get the conjunctions squares, trines and oppositions. 

When the Parallels have been recorded the index is finished; and if placed below the horoscope on one sheet of paper as shown in the accompanying illustration the student will have ready at hand every means of judging the figure without turning his attention from that to computing aspects. Thus a more concentrated attitude of the mind is attainable. Neither is the process of making the index as complicated as the process of describing it; in fact, it is simplicity itself, as it involves no mathematical calculation but only the proper methodical placement of the left index finger and moving a pencil point to the right or upward from that finger merely asking continually: Are the planets under finger and pencil within orb? If this method is followed out the student can never miss an aspect and will be able to make such an index in from fifteen to twenty minutes. 

In order that proficiency may be achieved, the student should endeavor to make the index for the horoscope cast for August 2nd., 8:15 A.M. 

Aspects to the Ascendant, which represents the body, have an influence upon the health. Aspects to the Midheaven indicate the nature of one's opportunities for spiritual advancement. But since the exact time of birth is rarely known, and since a small error in this makes several degrees difference in the Ascendant or Midheaven, predictions made from aspects to these points are likely to be found unreliable. Hence we have not entered them in the main index. 

NOTE: In addition to the foregoing, planets in the last six degrees of any sign must be compared with all planets in the first six degrees of other signs, because they may be in aspect to each other without coming under any of the preceding rules. Examples of this are as follows: 

Mars in 24-30 Aries is in conjunction with Venus in 0-30 Taurus; Mercury in 26-0 Taurus is sextile Jupiter in 2-0 Leo; Saturn in 27-9 Gemini is square Uranus in 2-0 Libra; Neptune in 28-0 Cancer is trine Mars in 3-0 Sagittarius; Venus in 29-30 Leo is in opposition to Mercury in 5-30 Pisces. 

#### <h4 id="to-the-student">TO THE STUDENT:</h4>

The foregoing chapters describe the basis of Astrology and illustrate in detail the method of erecting a horoscope. They also indicate the elements of the science of reading a horoscope. A great deal of additional information along these lines is given in the Philosophic Encyclopedia following. But the next volume in this series, the "Message of The Stars," is the Rosicrucian text book on the science of Astrological Reading, and the application of Astrology to our daily lives. It contains a complete exposition of the methods used in judging the radical horoscope, also in progressing the chart and making predictions therefrom. Medical Astrology and the diagnosis of disease are comprehensively dealt with, as are also the bearing of Astrology upon evolution and the general nature and effect of planetary vibrations. 

All who wish to go further in the subject are referred to this volume.  

<h2 id="part-2">PART II: A PHILOSOPHIC ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ASTROLOGY ACCIDENTAL DIGNITY:</h2>

When a planet is placed in an angle its effect is much more powerful than in the succedent or cadent houses. In this respect a position in the Tenth House is strongest on account of elevation (see ELEVATION), the First House is next, then the Seventh, and the Fourth House is weakest. 

ADJUSTED CALCULATION DATE: 

A date at which the noon positions of the planets culminate when used in the Progressed Horoscope. 

It is obtained by a simple calculation, and with it predictions may be made in any horoscope for life, without further mathematical computations; for a full explanation the student is referred to "The Message of the Stars." 

AFFLICTION: 

A planet is afflicted when it is parallel, conjunction, square or opposition to Mars, Saturn, Uranus or Neptune, or in square or opposition to any of the other planets (See COMBUST). 

AIRY SIGNS: 

Gemini, Libra and Aquarius are called Airy signs. Their influence is mostly mental and intellectual. 

ANGLES: 

The First, Fourth, Seventh and Tenth Houses. 

The Eastern angle with Aries, where Mars is the ruler, suggests the Sun rising to the material activities of the day. As the Sun, denoting spirit, is under the cross denoting matter, but rising toward it, therefore it denotes the beginning of Life in the material world, and Mars, the ruler, stands for the desire nature, which draws the spirit towards material existence in order that it may conquer matter. 

The Southern angle, Capricorn, with Saturn as ruler, suggests the Sun crossing the meridian as it does at noon. It has traversed half its prescribed journey across the heavens, therefore the half-circle is omitted, and the other half-circle is retained under the cross in the symbol of Saturn. Hence Saturn denotes persistence, mechanical ability, etc., and the Tenth House the worldly achievements of the human being. 

The Western angle with Libra in the balance where the material activities turn to the spiritual, divides the day from the night; the busy summer from the inactive winter. It turns the waking hours devoted to the active material life, into the night where man contacts the unseen world. Therefore the circle, spirit, is above the cross of matter, the desire nature has been conquered, and the symbol of Mars turned upside down so that it becomes the symbol of Venus, the planet of love which rules this house, and which is therefore also the house of unions, of partnerships, the house that denotes the one nearest and dearest to us. 

The Northern angle, with the sign Cancer, marks the time when the Sun is at its lowest point. The sign consists of two suns, with the line of force proceeding from each one, but in opposite directions. The line from the sun which points to the East denotes the direction in which the physical Sun moves. The sun with the line of force going towards the West denotes the path in which the spiritual influences turn after the physical Sun has ceased its activity. This angle, therefore, is the angle of mystery, occultism, and of the dark and unseen side of man's nature; therefore it has for its ruler the orb of night, the Moon. 

ANGULAR: 

A planet is said to be angular when it is placed in the angles of the horoscope. This position strengthens the influence of the planet considerably for good or ill according to the nature of the planet and its aspects. 

ANTARES: See 'FIXED STARS'. 

APPLY: When a swift moving planet approaches an aspect with a slower, it is said to apply to a square, trine etc. of that planet. As the applying planet must be speedier than the one it applies to, it is evident that the Moon applies in turn to the aspects of all the other planets each month when she passes around the zodiac, but Saturn who takes thirty years to make the circle can only apply to Uranus which uses eighty-four years, and to Neptune which takes a hundred and sixty-five years. 

That rule holds good when the planets move Direct in the Zodiac (from Aries to Taurus etc.), but if the slower moving planet is Retrograde (moving from Taurus to Aries etc.), both the planets may be applying to the aspect. (See DIRECT and RETROGRADE.) 

The influence of the planets is always stronger when they are applying than when they are separating. 

ASCELLI: See 'FIXED STARS'. 

ASCENDANT: 

The degree of the zodiac which is on the eastern horizon at a certain time. A new degree rises every four minutes, a new sign about every two hours, and the twelve signs rise in every place on earth in twenty-four hours. Whatever sign is on the Ascendant is called the Rising sign. See 'Hyleg'. 

ASCENSION: 

Under this heading will be grouped, Signs of Long Ascension, Signs of Short Ascension, Right Ascension and Oblique Ascension. 

Signs of Long Ascension are: Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius. 

Signs of Short Ascension are: Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus and Gemini. 

They are so called because the signs of Long Ascension rise slowly in Northern latitudes, taking a much longer time than the two hours required if all the twelve signs rose at a uniform rate during the twenty-four hours. Leo takes about two hours and forty-five minutes in latitude 40 North where New York is, and Pisces and Aries, two signs of Short Ascension, take only one hour and ten minutes. The reason lies in the obliquity of the Ecliptic, see page 49. The effect is that most people in the Northern Hemisphere are born under the signs of Long Ascension. 

In the Southern Hemisphere the signs listed as of Short Ascension in the foregoing classification, are signs of Long Ascension, and most people are born under them, while the Northern signs of Long Ascension rise quickly in the South and relatively few are born under them. Thus the people of the opposite hemispheres are also opposite in their inner natures, and show different characteristics. 

Right Ascension and Oblique Ascension are not used in the system of Astrology generally in vogue, except in the calculation of the houses, with which the average student has no concern. Longitude is measured on the ecliptic or Sun's path from the first point of Aries, but Right Ascension is measured on the equinoctial or celestial equator. 

ASPECTS: 

The distance apart of planets, which determines their influence for good or ill. 

The Square is 90 degrees and the Opposition is 180 degrees. These are called evil aspects. 

The Sextile is 60 degrees and the Trine is 120 degrees. They are called good aspects. 

The Conjunction occurs when two planets are in the same degree of the Zodiac, and the Parallel is the position of two planets in the same degree of declination, regardless of whether they are both North or South of the Equator, or whether one is in North and the other in South declination. 

These aspects are variable. If between benefics (the Sun, Venus and Jupiter), they are good, or if the planets of variable nature (the Moon and Mercury), are aspected by conjunction or parallel with the benefics it is good, but if the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus or Jupiter are in conjunction or parallel with one of the malefics (Mars, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune), it is evil; the conjunction of two malefics is more so, but the parallel of two malefics is exceedingly strong in its detrimental influence. Conversely, of course, the parallel between two benefics is extraordinarily fortunate. 

AXIS: 

If we were to pierce an apple through the center with a knitting-needle, that would be the axis of the apple, and on this axis it may be rotated. The earth's axis is an imaginary line on which the earth rotates, and this motion of the earth on its axis produces the phenomena of day and night. The axis of the earth always points to a certain star in the constellation Ursa Minor, which on that account is called the pole star; the only one in the heavens which seems never to move. It is not quite stationary however, but has an exceedingly slow vibratory motion called nutation, causing the pole star to change in the course of millenniums. See 'NUTATION' and 'INTELLECTUAL ZODIAC.' 

AXIS, INCLINATION OF: 

The axes of all the planets are inclined to their orbits. See page 8. 

AXIAL ROTATION: 

All the planets rotate upon their axes the same as the earth, but the time in which they make a rotation differs widely. See 'diurnal rotation of the planets,' page 8. 

BARREN or UNFRUITFUL SIGNS: Gemini, Leo and Virgo. 

BENEFICS: 

The Sun, Venus and Jupiter. For a thorough synthetic explanation of the terms 'Benefic' and 'Malefic,' see 'GOOD AND BAD,' also pages 76 and 77. 

CADENT: 

The third, sixth, ninth and twelfth houses are called cadent, and so are planets placed in these houses. This position weakens the influence of planets, so that benefics are not so helpful and malefics not so harmful when placed in cadent houses. 

CARDINAL SIGNS: 

Aries, the Eastern sign entered by the Sun at the vernal equinox; Cancer, where the Sun reaches its highest degree of Northern declination at the Summer Solstice; Libra, the Western sign where the Sun goes into South declination at the Fall equinox; and Capricorn, where it is in the lowest South declination at the Winter Solstice. 

The Cardinal Signs are promotive, they further activity in whatever is undertaken under their influence. 

COMBUST: 

Any planet within three degrees of the Sun is said to be combust, or burned up by the Sun's rays. If Mercury or the Moon are so placed, it weakens the mind: if Venus or Jupiter, it takes away their help and if one of the malefics (Mars, Saturn, Uranus or Neptune) is so placed, it is evil. See 'AFFLICTION.' 

COMMON SIGNS: 

Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces. They are flexible and vacillating in nature. 

CONJUNCTION: 

When two planets are within six degrees of each other they are in conjunction. See 'ASPECTS' and 'ORB.' 

CRITICAL DEGREES: 

See table and description of Critical Degrees on page 81. These degrees mark approximately the end of each day's travel of the Moon through the twelve signs. The Moon occupies about 27 1/2 days in its passage around the Zodiac, averaging about 13 degrees each day. Thus, starting with the first degree of Aries, the first day's travel will end at the 13th degree, the second day's travel at the 26th degree and so on. Following this out, we find that the Critical Degrees are the 1st, 13th and 26th degrees of the Cardinal Signs, the 9th and 21st degrees of the Fixed Signs, and the 4th and 17th degrees of the Common Signs. 

CULMINATE: 

When a planet reaches Zenith it is said to culminate, for it has then reached its highest altitude and then begins to descent toward the Western Node. This expression is also used concerning aspects. When a planet comes within orb of another the influence is at first weak, but it becomes stronger and stronger the nearer the applying planet comes to the exact aspect, and at that time it culminates or reaches its maximum strength. Then when the planets begin to separate and the aspect is gradually dissolved, the influence is correspondingly weakened, and finally ceases altogether. 

CUSP: 

The first degree of a house or sign. When the Sun leaves the 30th degree of Cancer and is in Leo 0 degree, 1 min., it is said to be on the cusp of Leo, the same with respect to the other signs. If Aries 10 degrees is on the Midheaven, as the cusp or dividing line between the ninth and tenth houses is called, and Neptune is in Aries 9 degrees 55 minutes, it is placed in the Ninth House on the cusp of the tenth. If it is in Aries 10 degrees 5 minutes, it is placed in the tenth house on the cusp. 

As the influence of planets having direct motion is always FORWARD in the Zodiac, a planet on the cusp of a house will always have a stronger influence on the affairs signified by that house than a planet which is placed in the latter degrees of a house. 

DECLINATION: 

The distance a planet is north or south of the Celestial Equator. The highest north declination of the Sun is 23 degrees 27 minutes, which it attains at the summer solstice the 21st of June, and at the winter solstice on the 21st of December it is in the corresponding degree, 23 degrees 27 minutes south declination. Mars, Mercury and the Moon reach declinations 27 degrees north, and on rare occasions Venus attains 28 degrees, but the other planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, have approximately the same declination as the Sun. 

Astronomy teaches that the declination of the Sun is due to the inclination of the earth's axis. 

DEGREE: 

A degree is the 360th part of a circle. There are 30 degrees in each of the twelve signs of the Zodiac, and the motion of the planets through these signs is stated in degrees and minutes of Longitude, commencing with the first degree of Aries. 

The Sun's path is called the Ecliptic, and is taken as the standard line of celestial motion so far as our solar system is concerned. The planets zigzag along the ecliptic sometimes a little to the north of the Sun's path, at other times a little to the south. The distance of a planet north or south of the Sun's path is called Latitude, and is also measured in terms of degrees and minutes. 

For an explanation of degrees of declination, see 'DECLINATION,' and for the use of degrees to measure Right Ascension, see 'MIDHEAVEN.' 

The foregoing explanations embody the use of the degree as a unit of measurement to fix the position of the planets on the celestial sphere containing the fixed stars; but degrees are also used in geography to determine the exact position of any city or place on the surface of the earth. Latitude is then reckoned in degrees from the Earth's equator, which has 0 degrees latitude, to the poles, which have respectively 90 degrees North and South latitude. 

Longitude is measured along the Earth's equator, 180 degrees East and West from the Meridian of Greenwich, which was accepted as a starting point in 1884 by delegates from all leading nations, France excepted. 

For the effect of distances measured in terms of longitude on the influence of the planets see 'ASPECTS.' 

For the influence of Latitude and Declination on the effect of the planetary aspects, see 'LATITUDE.' 

DESCENDANT: 

The opposite of Ascendant, the point on the western horizon where the Sun and the planets set, so called, because from thence the heavenly bodies commence their 'descent' towards the nadir of the celestial sphere. 

DETRIMENT: 

The opposite of 'Dignity,' which see. 

DIGNITY: 

A planet is said to be in its dignity, or to be 'Essentially Dignified,' or to 'Rule,' when it is in certain signs which agree with it in nature, for then the power of the sign and the power of the planet are compounded. The influence of the planet is thus strengthened. Conversely, a planet is said to be in its detriment when it is in the sign opposite to the one it rules for then the nature of the sign and the nature of the planet are incompatible and antagonistic, and as a result the influence of the planet is weakened.

NOTE: France accepted the Greenwich Meridian, March 10, 1911.

The table on page 81 shows the rulership of the planets over the various signs and a study thereof will bring out the underlying system and philosophy. 

The Sun is the center of our solar system, the giver of life and heat, and the Moon is (so far as our earth is concerned), the collector and reflector of its vitalizing rays. The solar ray attains its greatest intensity in midsummer* when the Sun is in Cancer and Leo, during June and July, and so Leo, the lion, being a masculine sign of a fiery nature is in essential agreement with the nature of the Sun and therefore helps to dignify and strengthen it. 

*This applies to Northern Hemisphere only. 

The effect of the feminine Moon on the earth's tides shows its inherent affinity for water, which brings it into essential agreement with the feminine watery sign Cancer. On that account Cancer is its home where it is strongest and most dignified. 

The keyword of the Sun is life, and that of the Moon is fecundation. The germ of life which comes from the Sun is planted and watered by the Moon which measures the period of gestation and brings all things to birth. Saturn is the planet of obstruction and decay, the reaper with hour-glass and scythe who cuts off the life given by the Sun and fostered by the Moon, when his hour-glass shows that the fruits of life's experience are ripe for harvest. Thus he is the planet of death, and moves in an orbit on the outskirts of the solar system, which is the boundary of Chaos, where all things are dissolved and transmuted by spiritual alchemy to finer and finer textures.

Therefore Saturn is in essential agreement with Capricorn and Aquarius, the signs occupied by the Sun during the cold months of mid-winter, December and January. When placed in these signs his cold, clammy hand makes itself felt as a powerful force that crushes life and joy, that covers the life with the gloom of death. 

Between the orbits of Saturn and the Sun are the orbits of the other planets, and when arranged in order of their distance from the Sun, with the signs of the zodiac so placed that Leo and Cancer are in the center with their rulers, the Sun and Moon, and Saturn's signs, Capricorn and Aquarius, one on each wing it appears that-- 

Jupiter whose orbit is inside Saturn's, rules the two signs next to Saturn's, namely Sagittarius and Pisces. 

Mars' orbit is inside of Jupiter's, therefore he rules the signs next to Jupiter's, namely Aries and Scorpio. 

Venus is inside Mars' orbit, so she is dignified in the signs next to Mars' signs, namely, Taurus and Libra. 

Mercury, which is nearest to the Sun, rules the signs between those of Venus and the Sun, namely Gemini and Virgo. See 'EXALTATION." 

DIRECT: 

When planets move with the order of the signs (from Aries to Taurus etc.), they are said to be direct, but when they appear to move contrary to the order of the signs (from Aries to Pisces), they are said to be retrograde. In the ephemeris a capital 'R' at the top of the monthly page is placed with the degrees and minutes of the planet's longitude on the day when it begins to retrograde, and at the top of its column while this motion continues. When the planet resumes its direct motion, this is indicated by a capital 'D,' but there are no 'D's' at the top of columns in the ephemeris to indicate that the planets are 'direct' for that is their natural line of progression. The 'R's' are only used to mark that which is an anomaly. 

The Sun and Moon are always direct in their motion, they are never stationary or retrograde. See chapter on Retrogradation page 72.  

DIRECTIONS: 

When a child is born it is immersed in an atmosphere charged with the stellar vibrations peculiar to that moment, which are stamped upon each atom of the sensitive organism by the air inhaled with the first breath. This planetary baptism is the basic cause of all the child's characteristics and idiosyncrasies; it gives certain tendencies which remain through life. This is the Radix or Radical Horoscope which we carry about in our bodies and, whether we know it or not, it is the root of all events in life. 

But the planets do not remain stationary in the positions they occupied at the time of our birth; their progress is eternal as is that of our Father in Heaven, and in time they form aspects other than those which they made at birth. These progressed configurations are called Directions, and they mark the time in life when events are due to occur. 

Directions are of two kinds, Primary and Secondary. 

Primary Directions are formed between the progressed planets and their positions at birth. If, for instance, the Sun was in no degrees of Aries and Jupiter in 25 degrees of Leo at the birth of an individual, then, as the Sun moves forward in the Zodiac at about one degree a day, it will be trine with Jupiter about twenty-five days after birth. The system of time measurement of the planetary progression in general use reckons each day after birth equal to a year of life. Thus the said individual will meet with a very fortunate event in the twenty-fifth year. 

Aspects may also be formed between two progressed planets; to follow out the example given in the last paragraph, Jupiter would progress one or two degrees in the twenty-five days. It would then be in 26 or 27 degrees of Leo, and after the Sun had passed the trine with the radical Jupiter and it would come to the trine of the progressed Jupiter and this would prolong the fortunate influence for several years, though it should be borne in mind that the effect of aspects between two progressed planets is not so strong as when the configuration is between a progressed and a radical planet. 

Secondary Directions are formed by the progression of the Moon to aspects with the planets, particularly the radical. These lunar aspects are of vital importance, for unless the primary directions are supported by aspects of the progressed Moon which are of a similar nature, they come to naught. To illustrate by reference to the example of the Sun trine Jupiter. If at the time when that culminated, the progressed Moon had been in Gemini 25, sextile to both the Sun and Jupiter, that would have given a wonderfully favorable impetus to the event signified by the direction, but had the Moon been in Taurus 25, square to Jupiter it would have prevented the event and caused trouble instead. Had there been no secondary lunar direction at the time the event would have remained latent until the next lunar aspect of the progressed Moon either brought it out to life or withered it. 

Lunations (New Moons) are also powerful factors in energizing directions, particularly if they are eclipses. See 'LUNATIONS' and 'ECLIPSES,' also 'TRANSITS'. 

DOUBLE BODIED SIGNS: 

Gemini, Sagittarius and Pisces. So called because in the pictorial Zodiac Gemini is represented as a pair of twins, Sagittarius as a Centaur, part man and part horse, and Pisces as two fishes. They are of a dual, vacillating nature, and it is remarkable that events in the lives of people having these signs prominent are repeated. They marry several times, their misfortunes never come singly, but their good fortunes also come in multiple. 

DRAGON'S HEAD: 

The Moon's North Node. The Nodes are points in the orbit of a planet where it crosses the ecliptic, or Sun's path. The one where it crosses from south to north is called its ascending or North node; the other point where it crosses from north to south is called its descending or South node. 

When the Sun is in the East and crosses the celestial equator from the south to the north, it enters its martial exaltation sign Aries as a conquering king at the vernal equinox, and all nature wakens to the life, love and labor of another year. Therefore the point where the lesser Light crosses into the north declination is also subject to a benign life-giving influence, such as that ascribed to the Dragon's Head. It fosters and promotes all matters within its influence. 

But in the Fall, Saturn, Satan, or the adversary, stands in his exaltation-sign Libra ready to vanquish with his cold clammy hand the life-giving Sun and usher it across its descending node, leaving the Northern Hemisphere to mourn and die. Therefore the Moon's South Node, called the Dragon's Tail, is deemed to be Saturnine in its effect and obstructs all things wherewith it is connected. 

DRAGON'S TAIL: 

The Moon's South Node. See Dragon's Head. 

EARTHY SIGNS: Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn. 

ECLIPSES: See 'LUNATIONS.' 

ECLIPTIC: The Sun's path among the constellations of the firmament. 

ELECTION: See 'HORARY ASTROLOGY.' 

ELEVATION: 

The zenith which is occupied by the Sun at Noon, is the highest point in the heavens. The nearer that position a planet is, the more Elevated it is said to be. Thus a planet in the Eleventh House is elevated above another which is in the Twelfth House, and a planet in the Tenth House is elevated above all other planets. 

Elevation is very important, for it adds considerably to the influence of a planet for good or ill. If Mars, the planet of dynamic energy, is elevated and in its own sign Aries, it endows the person with an almost inexhaustible fund of energy and an indomitable courage, which will be found lacking if he is placed in a weak sign and position like Virgo and the Sixth House. Similarly with the other signs and planets. 

EPHEMERIS, PLURAL- EPHEMERIDES: 

An ephemeris is a twin sister of the Almanac, and gives the geocentric Longitudes and Declinations for the current year. It is absolutely necessary in astrological calculations. But just as it is necessary to get a new almanac for each year to see when the Moon is New and Full, when it is Easter or Christmas, etc., so also is it necessary to have an ephemeris for every year when we want to cast horoscopes for people. True, the planets circle about the Sun, but each has its own specific speed, and they do not come into the same position relative to one another that they have while you are reading this, until a period which is called the Great Sidereal Year (25,868 ordinary years), has elapsed. Therefore all horoscopes, even the horoscopes of twins differ, and it is necessary to have an ephemeris for the birth year of any person before you can cast his horoscope. 

EQUATOR: 

The earth's equator is an imaginary line in a plane at right angles to the axis of the earth, and midway between the North and South poles. It divides the earth into two hemispheres, the Northern and Southern. If a pole hundreds of millions of miles in length were thrust through the earth from the equator to the center of the earth, the outer end would inscribe a line on the firmament, when the earth rotates on its axis, and this imaginary line is called the Celestial Equator, or Equinoctial. The latter name is given it because when the Sun is at the points where the ecliptic or Sun's path crosses the celestial equator we have the equinoxes, the times when the days and nights are of equal duration. 

EQUINOCTIAL: See 'EQUATOR.' 

EQUINOX: 

The equinoxes occur on the 21st of March when the Sun enters Aries, and the 21st of September when the Sun enters Libra. At those times the day and night are of equal length all over the earth. See 'EQUATOR,' and 'PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOX.' 

ESSENTIAL DIGNITY: 

A planet is strengthened or essentially dignified when it is in a sign which agrees with its own nature. This is thoroughly explained under 'Dignity,' which see. 

EXALTATION: 

It is explained under 'Dignity,' that when a planet is in a sign of similar nature, it is thus strengthened or Dignified, but when another planet of the same nature as the ruler enters that sign it compounds its own qualities with those of the ruler and the sign, and becomes Exalted or powerfully strengthened. For instance, Aries is a dry, fiery sign. It is ruled by Mars, a dry, fiery planet, and when the Sun, the source of heart and the giver of Life enters this sign it is exalted to the superlative degree of power, and forthwith Life begins to manifest in all departments of nature. The point to be borne in mind concerning what constitutes exaltation is that it requires the compounding of three similar natures. Scorpio is also a martial sign, but it is water and not in as complete agreement with the nature of the Sun as Aries, therefore the Sun could not be exalted in Scorpio as it is in Aries. 

As the Lord of life and heat, the Sun, is always opposed by Saturn in the rulership of their signs, Leo and Aquarius, so also the cold and deathly Saturn opposes the Sun from its exaltation-sign Libra. Venus and Mars are the planets of attraction from the point of sex, and as all that is generated by sex is under the sway of death, Mars has thus a right to rule Scorpio, the eighth-house sign denoting death; it is also properly exalted in the Saturnine sign Capricorn, and Saturn, the Lord of Death is justly ascribed exaltation-power in Libra, the cardinal masculine sign of Venus. 

Cancer, the moist and feminine sign ruled by the Moon is next to Leo, the hot and dry sign ruled by the Sun. It is therefore required by the law of analogy that the exaltation-sign of the Moon should be next to that of the Sun, in Taurus. Venus, the planet of Love, offers an avenue for the expression of the lunar forces of fecundation, and the moist feminine and fruitful sign Taurus is in entire agreement with these tendencies, hence this sign offers the most powerful expression for the force working though the Moon, and she may therefore rightfully be called exalted in Taurus. Venus binds us in the bonds of love for the perpetuation of the race, therefore that love is essentially selfish, hence productive of sorrow. Who has loved much, has suffered much, hence the tear-stained Venus is exalted in the watery twelfth-house-sign Pisces, the sign of sorrow. There, by the purifying effect of grief, the earthly, sensual love is transmuted to Altruism under the benefic ray of Jupiter, the ruler, for it is not the will of our Father that we should suffer beyond what we can bear, but He will with every temptation provide a way of escape. 

Cancer was pictured on the ancient Egyptian Zodiac as a beetle or scarab, which was their emblem of the soul, and it is an esoteric truth that all souls enter terrestrial life through the sphere of the Moon, Cancer. Conception depends upon the place of the Moon and the angle of its ray. Sagittarius, the Centaur, is the symbol of aspiration, the man coming out of the animal, and pointing his bow heavenward. This sign is ruled by Jupiter, the planet of Benevolence, which is now the seed ground where our future home is being prepared, where we shall sometime dwell when we have learned the lessons to be taught in the Earth Period and are ready to take up higher work of the Jupiter Period as taught in The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception. 

Thus, as the solar forces reflected through Cancer and the Moon result in generation, so the spiritual ray of the Sun reflected through Cancer and Jupiter act as a regenerative power strengthening the psychic and religious nature, and therefore Jupiter is truly said to be exalted in Cancer. 

Mercury is a planet of a variable nature; it takes on the color and characteristics of any sign or planet with which it is configurated; therefore it has no particular affinity with any of the other planets or signs ruled by the other planets, and hence must seek exaltation in its own signs. And as Gemini is masculine it is not so well in accord with Mercury as is the listless negative sign Virgo, hence that is the sign of Mercury's exaltation. 

FALL: 

When a planet is in the sign opposite its exaltation-sign it is said to be in its 'fall,' for that sign, its Lord and exaltation-ruler are all of exactly the opposite nature. Thus, when the glorious Sun which is exalted in Aries, is in the opposite sign Libra where the cold and dreary Saturn has domain, it is weakened and afflicted thereby. Conversely, when Saturn is in the sign Aries, the Sun's exaltation-sign, it shrivels and shrinks under the heat rays. When the benefic amiable Jupiter, exalted in Cancer, is placed on the opposite sign Capricorn, the sign of the surly Saturn, and the exaltation-sign of the brusque Mars it is surely afflicted and in its fall. Similarly with the other planets. 

FEMININE SIGNS: 

The feminine signs comprise the six signs with even numbers: Taurus, the second sign, Cancer the fourth sign, etc. This includes the earthy signs, Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn; and the watery signs, Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. Earth and water are the two attributes of 'Mother' Nature. Given them she is able to bring forth, and so the signs which have affinity with these essential elements may well be called 'feminine.' Even Virgo, which is essentially barren is perhaps the most important of the feminine signs for when the Sun is in Virgo during September, the spiritual wave of rejuvenating life commences its descent into the earth where it centers at Christmas and then commences to radiate the germinal life which springs forth and blooms at Easter.* Then the Savior having given his life once for all, once more ascends to the Father. 

*Six months later in the Southern Hemisphere.

FIERY SIGNS: Aries, Leo and Sagittarius. 

FIXED SIGNS: 

Taurus, Scorpio, Leo and Aquarius are called 'fixed' signs because when they are on the angles of a horoscope and many planets are in them, they make the person very 'set,' and give him an unusual amount of perseverance so that he will nearly always achieve whatever he attempts to do if it is humanly possible. 

FIXED STARS: 

The twelve constellations of the Zodiac are composed of a large number of stars, and all over the firmament we see clusters of luminous bodies, which seem to preserve the same position relative to one another, differing in this respect from the Sun, Moon and planets which we see moving among the star clusters. Therefore the star clusters composing the zodiacal constellations are called 'fixed stars.' It is a matter of knowledge however, that their immobility is only apparent because of their vast distance from us, and that they are really rushing through space at an enormous speed. 

----- 

In astrology we deal principally with the twelve constellations of fixed stars composing the Zodiac. There is no doubt that other fixed stars have an influence on human affairs, but our minds are still too weak to grasp the full significance of zodiacal signs, the planets and houses in all their multitudinous combinations, and if we attempt to mix in the other fixed stars and their aspects we shall surely be lost in the maze. Therefore the student is advised to consider only the following fixed stars: Pleiades, located in 29 degrees of Taurus; Ascelli, in 6 degrees of Leo; and Antares, in 8 degrees of Sagittarius. These stars, it has been observed, have a decidedly detrimental effect upon the eyes. When the Sun or Moon is in these degrees and afflicted by one of the malefics, or when one of the malefics is in one of these degrees, and the Sun or Moon afflicted anywhere in the horoscope, trouble with the eyes result. 

FIGURE: 

The horoscope, or map of the heavens cast by astrologers is usually spoken of as a 'figure.' 

FRUITFUL SIGNS: 

Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces, the signs comprising the watery Triplicity, are the particular vehicles of the fertilizing function in nature. When the Moon is in these signs she pours out with specially free hand the Water of Life, the fecundating principle, and it is a matter of observation that seeds planted when the Moon is in these signs bear more bounteously than when planted under less favorable conditions. 

GEOCENTRIC SYSTEM OF ASTROLOGY: 

When Copernicus proved that the earth and the other planets revolve around the Sun, he is said by scoffers and skeptics to have exploded the system of Astrology which regards the earth as the center around which the Sun, Moon and planets circle. That is a mistaken idea, which may perhaps be shown by an illustration. We still continue to say that the Sun rises, though we know that it is the earth that moves while the Sun remains stationary; but whether the Sun moves in a circle around the earth, and illuminates each portion of its surface in turn, or the earth moves upon its axis and thus exposes one part after another to the rays of the stationary Sun, the effect upon the earth is the same, namely, we get light and sunshine during part of the twenty-four hours. Similarly with the other planets, astrology judges their effects when in certain positions relative to the Earth, regardless of how they came there. Besides, it is so much more convenient to speak from the geocentric standpoint and say "the Sun rises at six," than to say "the axial rotation of the earth will bring us in line with the Sun's rays tomorrow at six o'clock." Even the most arrogant ranter against the so-called geocentric fallacy would probably balk at taking his medicine in that way. 

GOOD AND BAD: 

'Good' and 'bad' are terms one often hears applied to horoscopes, aspects and planets, and it therefore seems necessary to emphasize that in reality all is good. In the Father's Kingdom, the Universe, there can be nothing permanently 'bad,' and that which we so designate is really only good in the making. 

It may also be said that a horoscope is not necessarily good because the aspects of the planets are by trines and sextiles. Sometimes it is the very reverse, for it is in the struggle of life that we develop strength; very few are strong enough to stand prosperity. Chances are that in a horoscope full of good aspects there lurks the snare of indolence so that the person does not exert himself and becomes driftwood upon the ocean of life, while another who has what we call a very afflicted horoscope is roused by the adverse conditions generated by squares and oppositions, and by sheer force of will conquers his stars and masters his destiny. In that case, and there are many, the 'bad' horoscope is surely a greater blessing than a good one. It is no use to have an automobile if we are too lazy to keep it oiled and cleaned, for it will give us a lot of trouble, and unless we keep the wheels of fortune oiled by constant attention to the opportunities of life, the horoscope will not help us no matter how 'good' it is. But if we have what is called a 'good' horoscope and do our part, it will prove a triumphal chariot in which we may ride the royal road of life. And the best axle oil is called helpfulness. The heavier you load your car down with lame and weary ones, the easier it will ride. 

And Saturn! Yes, it is true that he is responsible for most of the whiplashes of fate, but he can give us nothing that we have not earned, and the purpose is not vengeance, but education. The moment we realize that deep down in our hearts, we shall cease to murmur, and ask: Why is this happening to me, what have I done to deserve it? Then, seeking prayerfully for the reason, that we may learn to mend our ways in that respect and so escape kindred trials in future, we shall draw nearer to our Father, and learn to kiss the cross. Thus, instead of being an unmitigated evil, the visitations of Saturn are opportunities to correct our wrongdoings and learn wisdom. 

It is similar with the so-called Malefics. At present their influence seems evil to us because we have not learned to work in harmony with them for the highest good. 

But even today, the aspects of Saturn to the Moon and Mercury give depth to the mind and power of concentration, which are decidedly good. Mars in aspect with these planets energizes the mind and makes it more alert; Uranus in aspect to them gives a spiritual perception to those who can express this faculty, but they are very few. 

On the other hand, the so-called good planets may be decidedly detrimental by fostering self-indulgence, and therefore the appellation 'good' or 'bad' is ambiguous. The true esoteric student will carefully cultivate this mode of mind with regard to the factors in Astrology, and always base his judgment on this conception of the planets and their aspects. 

A malefic that is well placed and aspected will prove of more help than a benefic that is weak and afflicted. 

GREAT SIDEREAL YEAR: See 'Intellectual Zodiac.' 

HELIOCENTRIC ASTROLOGY: 

A system introduced by certain modern astrologers in an effort to conform to the Copernican conception of the solar system with the Sun as the center. It is not satisfactory however, for while those who practice geocentric Astrology have the records and observations of past ages to guide them, the votaries of the new system have mainly speculation. 

HORARY ASTROLOGY: 

The science of judging how a certain matter will turn out from a figure set up for the time the question was asked. The philosophy is that the same stellar influence which makes a person sufficiently anxious to ask the question contains also the answer. Therefore, if the person who wants to know is an astrologer, he erects a horoscope for the time when he first thought of consulting the stars. If a person who cannot set up a figure applies personally to an astrologer, the latter sets up a figure for the time when the question is asked of him, and if the question comes through the mail, he casts a horoscope for the time he actually read the question in the letter. This is very important, for if the figure be set up for a wrong time, the judgment is certain to be wrong. It sometimes happens that the matter asked about has not reached such a state of completion that the issue is settled, and a definite answer can be given. Therefore the first thing to do after the figure has been cast, is to see if it is 'radical,' and can be judged. 

If the first or second degree of any sign is rising, or if one of the three last degrees of any sign rises, or if the Moon is in the last three degrees of any sign, or void of course, it is not safe to judge but the inquirer should wait a more favorable time and ask the question again. 

When Saturn is on the Ascendant or in the First House he always obstructs the matter, and if he is in the Seventh House the astrologer's judgment fails. 

If none of these things hinder, the figure may be judged by the following method: 

The Lord of the Ascendant, planets in the First House, if any, and the Moon represent the inquirer. Determine next by what House the thing asked about is ruled, then consider whether the Lord of that House is favorably aspected with the Lord of the Ascendant, the planets in the First House, and the Moon. If so, the matter will come to a favorable conclusion, but if these significators are aspected by square or opposition, the matter will come to naught. 

But if someone else comes to you with a proposition, and you set up a figure to aid you in forming an idea of what to do, be sure to remember that he is the prime mover in the matter, and that therefore the Moon, Ascendant and First House are his significators, while you are represented by the seventh house and its lord. It does not matter that you ask the question, the proposition that you ask about is his; and lack of this knowledge has been a stumbling block to many who have given a wrong judgment on that account. 

The things signified by the Houses are briefly as follows: 

|                 |                                                          |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| FIRST HOUSE:    | Matters of an intimate personal nature.                  |
| SECOND HOUSE:   | Financial gain.                                          | 
| THIRD HOUSE:    | Matters concerning brothers and sisters, short journeys. |  
| FOURTH HOUSE:   | Houses and lands, patrimony and removals.                |
| FIFTH HOUSE:    | Children, messengers and newspapers.                     |
| SIXTH HOUSE:    | Servants and disease.                                    |
| SEVENTH HOUSE:  | Marriage, partnership, law-suits.                        |
| EIGHTH HOUSE:   | Legacies.                                                |
| NINTH HOUSE:    | Travel, mental state and capacity.                       |
| TENTH HOUSE:    | Social standing.                                         |
| ELEVENTH HOUSE: | Friends, hopes and wishes.                               |
| TWELFTH HOUSE:  | Enemies and trouble.                                     |

The planets which aspect your significators favorably show whence you may find help to obtain your wish, and the planets which afflict your stars indicate what hinders, and by blending these augurs you may know what to expect and how to proceed. Study these rules carefully and pay strict attention to them, then you will know how to answer all questions that may be asked. 

Horary Astrology may also be used to select a favorable time for commencing an important undertaking, for the starting point of an enterprise is its birth, and the influences then governing will be powerful determinators of success or failure. It is said that the Royal Astronomer who laid the corner-stone for the Observatory at Greenwich used this method, and that has certainly been a very useful and successful institution. 

To thus select a time for an undertaking is called "making an election." 

HORIZON: 

The birthplace is, in Astrology, always considered the highest point on earth, and the principal circle seem from there is the horizon. This is either sensible or rational. 

THE SENSIBLE HORIZON is the circle which bounds our view, where heaven and earth seem to meet. 

THE RATIONAL HORIZON is below the sensible horizon, in the plane of the Earth's center. 

HOUSES: 

The houses are divisions of the heavens relative to the birthplace, and the signs are divisions of the heavens relative to the Vernal Equinox. The Zodiac appears to move at the rate of one degree in every four minutes, but the Houses are considered stationary relative to the birthplace. 

The birthplace is always considered the highest place on earth. And from that point four imaginary lines are drawn to the four cardinal points, North, East, South and West. Imagine a line drawn from your birthplace to the point directly overhead where the Sun is at noon. That would be directly South, and this line is regarded as the cusp of the Tenth House, which for that reason is called the Midheaven. If this line is extended through the center of the earth, to the opposite side of the earth and thence into space, that lower part would point North, and form the cusp of the Fourth House called the Nadir, which is opposite the Tenth. 

These two points are invested by the same degrees of the Zodiac, at any given time regardless of whether the birthplace is near the pole or the equator. In the latter case, we may also imagine a line drawn at right angles across the Meridian, (as the line in the horoscope from the Midheaven to the Nadir is called), from East to West, and that would then form the cusps of the First and Seventh Houses. By dividing each of the four sections into three we would have twelve compartments of equal size, namely thirty degrees each. 

But all birthplaces are not on the equator, and owing to the spherical shape of the earth and the inclination of the earth's axis, the sizes of the houses vary more and more as we approach the poles, so that some houses may have only twelve or fifteen degrees, while others have more than sixty. See page 49 for a more detailed analysis. 

The reason for this division of the earth into houses may be comprehended when we consider that the Sun's rays affect us differently in the morning, at noon and at night, also in summer and winter; and if we study the cause, we shall readily see that it is the angle at which the ray strikes us or the earth which produces the difference in effect. Similarly with the stellar rays, Astrologers have observed that a child born at or near noon, when the Sun's rays strike the birthplace from the Tenth House, has a better chance of advancement in life, other things being equal, than one born after Sundown, for the latter generally remains a servant. Therefore they say that the Tenth House determines social position and honor, but the Sixth House, which is just below the Western horizon rules service and employment. By similar observations and tabulations it has been found that the other planetary rays affect the various departments of life when their ray is projected through the other houses, and therefore each house is said to 'rule' certain things. The student will find a diagram of the houses and the affairs ruled by each on pages 30 and 31. 

The divisions of houses are sometimes called 'Mundane' Houses; and the signs of the Zodiac are also loosely spoken of as the 'houses' or 'homes,' of the planets which rule them, for instance, Virgo is the 'house' of Mercury, Capricorn is the 'home'of Saturn. 

HYLEG: 

A term used by ancient Arabian Astrologers to designate the points in the horoscope which are the principal foci of vitality and healthy, namely the Sun, Moon and Ascendant. 

It needs but little argument to show that the great and glorious reservoir of life which we call the Sun is an important factor in the matter of health, and that the lesser Light, the Moon, has dominion in this respect, for she collects and reflects the solar ray. And it is a matter of common knowledge that she is in some way connected with gestation, and parturition, therefore, the Moon is the particular significator of health in a woman's horoscope while the Sun has the strongest influence in a man's figure. Both are important however, for if, in a man's figure, Saturn is square to the Moon he will feel it, but if this configuration happens in a woman's horoscope, she will feel it more; and conversely, Saturn square to the Sun in a woman's horoscope will affect her health, but not in the same degree as it will that of a man when occurring in his figure. 

The reason why the Ascendant is designated as a factor in health and vitality is not so apparent upon the surface, but when we realize that the Ascendant at birth is the Moon's place at conception, the reason is obvious, for the Moon is the planet of fecundation, the focus and reflector of the solar Life-forces, and if, at the time of conception, when the human seed-atom was planted, she was in a weak sign like Virgo, there is a fundamental lack of energy and vitality at the very start of life, and a consequent lassitude which affects through all the years of its existence, the body then beginning to germinate. 

Thus, to sum up, the Sun, Moon and Ascendant are all important significators of health and vitality for both sexes, but the position and aspects of the Moon are more important to a woman than those of the Sun and Ascendant, and the position and aspects of the Sun are more vital to the health of a man than the two other factors. 

In modern times the word 'Hyleg,' and the designation of the vital parts of the horoscope as 'hylegiacal' places are not generally used. The writer always speaks of them as 'significators of health,' then everybody understands what is meant, and it seems senseless to befog the subject with mysterious terms when good, plain English conveys our meaning so much better. It should also be understood that to judge any subject, be it health, wealth, joy or sorrow or any other thing that may befall, the special significators give only a limited amount of information. To obtain a really comprehensive knowledge each subject must be judged from the horoscope as a whole. 

INFORTUNES OR MALEFICS: 

Mars, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, for explanation see 'Good' and 'Bad.' 

INFERIOR PLANETS: 

Astronomers so designate Venus and Mercury, because they always remain very close to the Sun, and are never seen in parts of the heavens opposite the Sun. The idea in the minds of the astronomers seems to be that these planets are in leading strings so to speak. The esoteric reason for their proximity to the Sun will be found on page 10, which see. 

INTELLECTUAL ZODIAC: 

On either side of the ecliptic or Sun's path are a number of fixed stars which form twelve groups or constellations, that are called 'signs of the Zodiac,' not because they resemble the animals they are supposed to represent, but because their influence has developed, or is still engaged in bringing out in us the main characteristics embodied in the animal symbol. The bombastic arrogance, the energy and courage which come from Aries could not be better symbolized than by the ram, neither could the quiet, but prodigious strength and the stubborn persistence which come from the divine Hierarchs who work with us from the constellation Taurus be more aptly described than by the symbolic 'Bull.' The characteristics of the other signs must be interpreted in similar terms, for the Zodiac is the womb of the Solar System; and sometime when we and the myriads of other beings who are now evolving in our solar system have learned all the lessons of this phase of existence, we also shall form a Zodiac and perform a similar service for others as the twelve Great Creative Hierarchies are now doing for us. 

These twelve constellations are called the 'Natural' Zodiac; they remain always in the same relative positions, at least their movement is so slight that centuries elapse without appreciable change in their position. Hence we may use a table of houses our whole life, but we must buy an ephemeris of the planets' places every year. 

Every year on the 21st of March the Sun leaves the Southern Hemisphere, crosses the celestial equator, and enters the Northern degrees of latitude where he remains during the summer. But owing to a vibratory motion of the poles of the earth, called 'nutation' by astronomers, the Sun crosses the celestial equator a little earlier (precedes) than it did the year before, and as day and night are of equal length at the point where the Sun crosses the celestial equator or equinoctial, this precedent crossing is called 'the precession of the equinox.' 

If there were no precession of the equinox the Sun would always enter the constellation Aries at the vernal equinox, but on account of this backward motion of one degree in about seventy-two years, the vernal equinox occurs in the first degree of Pisces about 2156 years later. After a similar period of time it recedes to the first degree of Aquarius, and so on through the circle of the twelve signs in about 25,868 years. At the time when the Sun was in Taurus, the sign of the 'Bull,' at the vernal equinox, the ancient Egyptians worshiped the sacred 'Bull Apis' and their priests wore the Uraeus or Serpent Symbol belonging to Scorpio, the serpent sign opposite Taurus, to indicate their possession of the esoteric wisdom. When the Sun went into Aries by precession it became idolatry for 'the chosen people' to worship the 'Bull,' or golden calf; they left 'Egypt' and pinned their faith to the 'lamb' or 'ram' which was then 'slain'. But according to the esoteric symbol of Libra, the scales of justice, which is opposite Aries, he shall come again as judge. In A.D. 498 the Sun was in the first degree of Aries at the equinox, and in the 1418 years which have since elapsed it has receded nineteen degrees, forty-two minutes, so that in 1916 the Sun crosses the equator in ten degrees, eighteen minutes of Pisces, and in the year 2654 it will be on the cusp of Aquarius. During the 2000 years which have elapsed since the equinox came within orb of Pisces, the Fishes, the religious rites have required that the people anoint themselves with the Piscean water at the door of the church, the Service was performed by a priest whose headgear was made to resemble the head of a fish, and they were commanded to abstain from the eating of meat at certain times, and bade eat fish instead. They were also taught to worship an Immaculate Virgin because Virgo is the sign opposite Pisces; and this worship will continue, though in a decreasing degree until the new ideal embodied in the sign Aquarius and its opposite sign Leo has superseded orthodox Christianity as that has taken the place of the earlier religions. 

Since the middle of last century the Aquarian influence, focused by the equinox, has made itself felt because the Sun's orb is so large that it touches the cusp of Aquarius, and as a consequence we have had an unprecedented awakening of thought and a galaxy of inventions previously undreamed of as remotest possibilities. But as the years go on, the equinoctial Sun will illuminate our minds in such a manner as to justify our grandchildren in speaking of this as "the dark age"; and when, in the year 2654, the Sun's actual entrance into Aquarius ushers in a new age, they will be justified in thinking of the Piscean age as we do of the time B.C. 

We see then, that there is a Natural Zodiac composed of the stationary star clusters, Aries, Taurus, etc., and a shifting Zodiac, which starts at the equinoctial point, no matter where in the constellations that occurs; and the first thirty degrees from that point are called Aries, the next thirty degrees are called Taurus, and so on. This is the Intellectual Zodiac. 

This may seem an arbitrary manner of division but it is a matter of observation that though the equinox actually occurs in Pisces ten degrees at the present time, the Spring activities ascribed to the Sun in Aries commence at once after the equinox. There is, however, a blending of Aries and Pisces which accounts for certain evolutionary changes. In this connection the student is referred to pages 26 and 27. 

INTERCEPTED: 

See article on 'Houses' before reading this. In the article on 'Houses,' it is stated that owing to the spherical shape of the earth and the inclination of the earth's axis, some of the mundane houses in the higher Northern latitudes are only twelve or fifteen degrees, while others are forty, fifty, or sixty degrees long. But the signs of the Zodiac are only thirty degrees, and it therefore follows that in cases where a mundane house is very long, one or even two whole signs may be included within its cusps. In the horoscope of Erman C. born January 25th, 1912 at 3 A.M. in Ogden, IA, we find 24 degrees of Sagittarius on the second cusp, and Aquarius 11 on the third. Thus the second house is forty-seven degrees long, including the whole sign Capricorn with the planets Mercury and Uranus, and an astrologer would describe the situation by saying that Capricorn is 'intercepted' in the second house. When he speaks of the planets in this intercepted sign he says that Mercury and Uranus are intercepted in Capricorn in the second house. 

When a sign is intercepted in a house, the opposite sign is also intercepted in the opposite house; consequently we find Cancer intercepted in the eighth house with Neptune in it. 

Regarding the influence of interception, we find that when a planet is in an intercepted sign its influence is held in abeyance or latency until by progression it moves out of the intercepted sign. This tendency may be somewhat modified by a strong aspect, or a number of minor or weak ones, but an intercepted planet never has the same power over the life as one that is free. 

LATITUDE: 

In Astronomy, the distance a planet is North or South of the ecliptic, or Sun's path. 

In Geography, the distance a city or place is North or South of the Equator. Note--The distance of the heavenly bodies north or south of the Celestial Equator is not called Latitude, but Declination. When the Sun is at its highest Northern point in the tropic of Cancer, we do not say that it is in twenty-three degrees of North latitude, but that it is in twenty-three degrees of North Declination. See 'DECLINATION.' 

LIGHTS: The Sun and Moon. 

LOGARITHMS: 

Were originally invented by Lord Napier to make arithmetical calculations easy. They were later adapted to the decimal system, and are used by astronomers who calculate directions by arc. But for calculation of the planets' places by Longitude and in relation to the day of twenty-four hours, it is necessary to calculate a special set, which will be found in the back of our ephemeris. By use of them multiplication is performed by addition, and division by subtraction. 

LONG ASCENSION: Signs of, See 'ASCENSION.' 

LONGITUDE: 

In Geography, Longitude is measured from the Meridian of Greenwich, East or West on the Equator. 

In Astronomy, the Longitude of the planets is measured on the ecliptic or Sun's path starting with the first point of Aries at the vernal equinox. When the distance is reckoned on the equinoctial, or celestial equator it is called Right Ascension. 

LORD: 

A planet is said to be 'Lord' of the signs it rules; e. g. Mars is Lord of Aries and Scorpio; Venus is 'Lady' of Taurus and Libra. See 'DIGNITY' and 'EXALTATION.' 

LUMINARIES: The Sun and Moon. 

LUNAR: Pertaining to 'Luna,' the Moon. 

LUNATION: 

A Lunation is a conjunction of the Sun and Moon, a 'New Moon.' In our ephemeris all New Moons, Full Moons, and eclipses are plainly marked at the head of the pages. 

When a lunation falls within three degrees of an aspect to any of the planets or other vital points in the radical horoscope it has a marked effect upon affairs during the current month, and will easily take the place of an aspect of the progressed Moon which is needed to fructify the planetary indications then in force. Even apart from primary directions, if a New Moon falls in close conjunction with a malefic, it will produce trouble in minor matters, and conversely, a lunation which falls on the place of Jupiter or Venus will make things pleasant. 

When a New Moon is a solar eclipse it produces first, the usual effect of a lunation during its current month, if in aspect with any of the radical planets, and secondly, similar effects during the months of the following year when aspects of the same nature are formed with the place of the eclipse. That is to say, if the eclipse fell in the twelfth house in Leo, square to Mars in Scorpio, in the third house, then it would produce enmity with brothers and sisters during the month of August when the eclipse was formed. In November when the lunation occurs in Scorpio more fuel will be added to the fire by the square with the eclipse. In February when the Sun is in opposition to the eclipse there will be more trouble from the same source, and also in May when the last square occurs. Conversely, if the initial aspect of the eclipse is good, more benefit will be experienced during the months when sextiles and trines are formed. 

The cycle of lunations is nineteen years; for example, in July 1900 the lunation occurred on the 26th of July in three degrees of Leo, and in 1919 another lunation will occur on the 26th of July in three degrees of Leo. Thus the student may calculate the lunations of future years with sufficient accuracy for all practical purposes. 

Eclipses may also be calculated for future years in a similarly easy rough and ready manner if the student has the ephemerides for past years. 

During her monthly course the Moon zigzags across the ecliptic, and at the conjunctions, or New Moons, is generally a number of degrees away from the ecliptic. Under such conditions we have just an ordinary New Moon. In order to have a total solar eclipse the Moon must be directly in the Sun's path as seen from the earth, and the declination of the Sun and Moon must be practically the same; also the moon must have practically no latitude. 

There are never less than two eclipses in a year, and they are solar, nor are there ever more than seven, but these extreme numbers happen very seldom. The usual number of eclipses is four; two solar and two lunar eclipses, and they usually come in pairs and six months apart. The Full Moon preceding or following a solar eclipse is usually a lunar eclipse. Also if on pair of eclipses occurs in February, look for the other pair in August. 

Bearing the above in mind, eclipses in any year may be found with fair success by the following simple rule: 

(1.) From the year for which eclipses are wanted, subtract 18. The resulting year we will call the 'Eclipse Year.' 

(2.) Search the 'Eclipse Year' for New and Full Moons which are eclipses. Note their dates only. 

(3.) In the year previous to the 'Eclipse Year,' note the dates and zodiacal places of the lunations which occur about eleven days AFTER the dates obtained in the 'Eclipse Year.' These are dates and places of eclipses in the year wanted. 

In order to test the simple rules of thumb here given, let us imagine this is the year 1910, and that we want to find the first solar eclipse occurring in 1915. We take an ephemeris for 1897 which is eighteen years earlier than 1915, and look for the first solar eclipse. 

We find a solar eclipse on the 1st of February 1897. 

To ascertain the date and degree of the Zodiac in which this eclipse will fall in 1915, we look for information in the ephemeris for 1896, which is one year earlier than the 'Eclipse Year' 1897. 

There we find that the first New Moon which occurred after February 1st, fell in the afternoon of the 13th of February, in twenty-four degrees, nineteen minutes of Aquarius, and we therefore judge that there will be a solar eclipse on the 13th of February 1915 in twenty-four degrees, nineteen minutes of Aquarius. 

After completing our calculations we cease to make believe about living in 1910, and take up the ephemeris for 1915 to see if our rules have given the right result; and we find that a solar eclipse did occur on the morning of the 14th of February 1915, in Aquarius, twenty-four degrees, forty-two minutes, proving the rule to have given an essentially correct result. See 'TRANSITS.' 

MALEFICS: 

Mars, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. See 'Good and Bad.' 

MASCULINE SIGNS: 

Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius and Aquarius are called Masculine. These include the fiery triplicity, Aries, Leo and Sagittarius, and the airy triplicity, Gemini, Libra and Aquarius. The feminine signs include the earthly and watery Triplicities. 

Earth and water are negative and inert, but are acted upon by the POSITIVE elements. The winds stir the waters of the ocean and volcanic fires shake the earth. Therefore the fiery and airy signs are called masculine. See 'FEMININE SIGNS.' 

MERIDIAN: 

An imaginary circle drawn between the North and South poles over the face of the earth. As this line runs directly North and South, all places located thereon have noon at the same time. See 'HOUSES.' 

MIDHEAVEN, OR ZENITH: 

The point in the sky, directly overhead. When it is noon, the Sun is in the Midheaven. It is usually written M. C. See 'HOUSES.' 

MOVABLE SIGNS. 

Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn. See 'CARDINAL SIGNS.' 

MUNDANE HOUSES, AND MUNDANE ASPECTS: 

See 'HOUSES.' 

MUTUAL RECEPTION: See 'RECEPTION.' 

NADIR, OR IMMUM COELI, USUALLY WRITTEN I. C. 

The point in the heavens directly beneath the birthplace opposite the other side of the earth. It is the point opposite to the Midheaven. The Sun is there at Midnight. See 'Midheaven' and 'Houses.' 

NATIVITY: 

The same as 'Horoscope,' and 'Radix;' a map of the heavens cast for the moment of birth. See 'FIGURE.' 

NATURAL ZODIAC: See 'INTELLECTUAL ZODIAC.' 

NEBULAE: 

Cloudy star clusters, worlds in the making. Three of them are known to have an inimical effect on the eyesight. See 'FIXED STARS.' 

NODES: See 'DRAGON'S HEAD.' 

NORTHERN SIGNS: 

Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, and Virgo. So called because the Sun is in these signs when he is above the equator in the Spring and Summer. 

NUTATION: 

A vibratory motion of the axis of the earth which is responsible for the precession of the equinox. See 'INTELLECTUAL ZODIAC.' 

OBLIQUE ASCENSION: See 'ASCENSION.' 

OCCIDENTAL: 

Western. When the Sun or planets have passed the Zenith, Midheaven or noon mark, they begin to set towards the Western horizon, therefore the planets in the ninth, eighth and seventh houses of the horoscope are said to be 'occidental' or Western, and planets in the twelfth, eleventh and tenth houses which are ascending from the Eastern horizon to the Midheaven, as the Sun does in the forenoon, are said to be 'oriental' or Eastern. 

But when the Sun sets in the place where we live, it rises on another part of the world represented by the sixth, fifth, fourth, third, second and first houses of our horoscope, and during that time it is also oriental, and occidental to their Midheaven, which corresponds to our Nadir. When it rises from their Eastern horizon, which is our descendant, through the sixth, fifth and fourth houses, it is called oriental, and when it gradually sets towards their Western Horizon, which is our Ascendant, it is called occidental. 

Therefore, planets in the twelfth, eleventh, tenth, sixth, fifth, and fourth houses are called oriental, and the planets in the other six houses are called occidental or Western. 

OPPOSITION: 

When two planets are in the same degree of opposite signs, they are said to be in 'Opposition.' See 'Aspect' and 'Orb.' 

ORB: 

Planets form aspects which influence human affairs when they are in the same degree of the Zodiac, or a certain number of degrees apart. But it has been found that the influence is felt even when planets are not exactly the required number of degrees apart. Thus a planet has a subtle sphere which makes it effective before an exact aspect is formed, and after it has been dissolved, and this is called its orb. 

ORBIT: The path or a planet around the Sun. 

ORBITAL REVOLUTION: 

The revolution of a planet in its orbit around the Sun. The time occupied by the orbital revolutions of all the planets is given on page 7. 

ORIENTAL: 

Eastern, see 'Occidental' for explanation. 

PARALLEL: 

The aspect formed between two planets when they are in the same degree of declination, either North or South of the celestial equator. See page 75. 

PART OF FORTUNE: 

A point in the horoscope which opposes or favors the financial fortunes according to the aspects it receives from the planets. The philosophy and the method of calculating it are given on page 60 etc. To prove whether the 'Part of Fortune' is rightly calculated, observe whether the distance from the Sun to the Moon equals the distance from the Ascendant to the 'Part of Fortune.' 

PHYSICAL APPEARANCE: 

The physical type is determined by four principal factors. These are the Ascendant or Rising Sign, which represents the body, the Lord of the Ascendant, Rising Planets, namely planets in the first house, particularly when they are in the sign on its cusp, and the Sign containing the Sun. Note however, that the Sun must have some strength in the matters of position and aspects in order to bring into evidence the physical characteristics of its sign. The above elements are arranged in the usual order of their importance. Their blending determines whether a person be tall or short, dark or fair, and all his other physical peculiarities. See "Message of the Stars" for a more detailed explanation of this matter. 

PLANETS: 

The heavenly bodies of God's Ambassadors which circle about the Sun. 

As man is made in the image of God, who is threefold in manifestation, so astrologically, the higher self in man is represented by a circle with the central point denoting the highest spiritual aspect, the Divine Spirit whose faculty is Will. Therefore, the Sun stands in the horoscope as the highest expression of the individual self. It denotes the positive outgoing influence in man, his character in the highest sense of the word. 

The symbol of the planet Venus is a circle above the cross. It denotes wisdom which is not mere intellectuality, but Intuition and Imagination. Hence, the nature of Venus is essentially love, and it is the cementing influence in the life whereby we are attracted to others for mutual benefit; although Venus in and of herself is not concerned with mutual benefit, it being her nature to attract others, and that good comes by her is only an incident. 

The planet Jupiter is symbolized by the half-circle above the cross. It denotes the Human Spirit, whose faculty is abstract thought. Therefore the planet Jupiter stands for the higher mind, the mind that is unconcerned with material things, and expresses itself in abstract thought, as religion, philosophy and the higher sciences. 

Mars is the opposite of Venus. It is symbolized by the cross above the circle, so that while it is Venus's nature to unselfishly love, and to give to others, it is the nature of Mars to desire for selfish ends. It therefore denotes all the outgoing energy of the lower nature, the desire body, the passional an emotional aspect of man, which causes him to work outwards in the world, to overcome obstacles and to gather experience. 

Saturn is the opposite of Jupiter, the cross of matter above the half-circle denoting the brain mind. It is that which gives persistence to the impulses of Mars, and symbolizes the relatively permanent part of the lower nature, that which has been weighed and found to be of use. It is, therefore, symbolical of the seed-atoms of Man's lower vehicles, wherein are stored the experience of all past lives. Hence, Saturn denotes the mechanical ability, the chastity and justice; the perseverance and material attainments which have been made into virtues through his purging influence. He stands as the reaper of the things that have been sown in the body, and as such he appears often in the life to chastise us for the wrong we have done; not vandalistically, but in order that we may learn the lessons of how to act rightly. 

The Moon is the reflection of the Sun. That together with the Ascendant, denotes the formation of the physical body, and the Ascendant the significator of the dense body. Hence, these two stand for that which is man's tool in action; the most perfect part of his nature, but at the same time, the most evanescent. The Moon is, therefore, the very antithesis of the Sun. The latter is a fixed star while the Moon is the most migratory of the heavenly bodies. 

The three last named planets are the significators of the lower nature in man, the personality, as opposed to the individuality symbolized by the three first named planets; and these two triangles are connected by the planet signifying the lower concrete mind, namely Mercury. The symbol of that planet has in it all three constituents of planetary symbolism, the circle, the half-circle and the cross, showing it to have no nature of its own, but to be a vehicle for the expression of the other planets. When Mercury is well posited with reference to Venus, we have the artistic, poetical, musical and literary type of mind. For it is from Venus that the vibrations come which express themselves in all art. 

When Mercury is well placed in relation to Jupiter, we have the philosophical and scientific mind, the ruler and the law-giver, both in church and state who works for the good of all. 

When Mercury is well posited with regard to Mars, we have the man of action; the man who aims at the material development of the world's resources in a small or large way, as a shopkeeper, storekeeper and all other ways wherein others are exploited for personal benefit, for Mars is, as already said, the antithesis of Venus, and the embodiment of selfish desire. 

Mercury in aspect to the Moon has no significance, as the Moon itself is a reflector; except where it is an evil aspect coming from a cardinal sign or elevation. There it may produce flighty thinking. 

In the foregoing, only the essential natures of the planets have been given. Where they are well aspected by another planet these natural characteristics are enhanced so far as the benefic planets are concerned, but when evilly aspected, the nature of Venus, which is wisdom, love and rhythm, will become folly, licentiousness, and sloth; the philosophy, law-abiding tendencies mercy and lofty aspirations of Jupiter will turn into lawlessness, disregard of others, and low pursuits; the lofty spirituality of the Sun will express itself as just animal spirits and physical health. In regard to the planets of the lower nature, good aspects to Mars turn the desires towards constructive objects and well regulated activities while the evil aspects are responsible for the destructive expression of the desire nature. Saturn, when well aspected, gives the mechanical and executive ability that is capable of directing the desire nature. It shows the brainy, persevering man who is able to cope with and conquer material obstacles; the organizer and promoter; the scientific investigator, who follows along material lines. As it is the antithesis of Jupiter, it will be readily seen that as Jupiter, well aspected, denotes the high-minded philosopher, the worthy law-giver, the sincere and ardent priest, in fact, all who have high and lofty aspirations, so Saturn, when evilly aspected, denotes the narrow-minded, creed-bound sectarian, the materialist, the anarchist and the enemy of society, whether of the church or state. As Jupiter gives the lofty, expansive and benevolent mind, so Saturn, evilly aspected, gives the sarcastic, concrete and narrow tendencies. 

Uranus: Besides the seven planets already mentioned, two others are in our system, Uranus and Neptune. Uranus may be said to be the octave of Venus, having her nature in a much more subtle degree; its attractions are so spiritual that they cannot be felt by the ordinary man in the proper manner, and he therefore, more readily responds to the evil side of Uranus. It is the planet which rules the ether, and when in aspect to Mercury, or in the Ascendant, or with the Moon, it produces a touch with the force we know as electricity. Its operations are always very sudden, and as mankind responds to its evil side, as already stated, these effects show themselves particularly in the form of disaster. 

Neptune is the octave of Mercury. As mercury is the light-bearer for the physical Sun, so is Neptune the light-bearer of the spiritual Sun, called Vulcan among occultists, which is seen back of the visible Sun. Naturally, therefore, still fewer among humanity are capable at all of being affected by it, save that it produces a chaotic state of mind when placed in evil aspect. When placed in angles, and particularly in elevations near the Midheaven, it produces Occultists and Mystics of the highest stamp; but when placed in cadent houses, it may bring mediumship, cunning, emotionalism. It is the highest string in the lyre of the soul of God, and is therefore the least used, and the one to get most easily out of tune. Astrologers are the most affected by it, and those musicians who use stringed instruments. 

PLANETARY HOURS: 

That the planets have dominion over the days of the week which represent the seven creative days, (Periods) is taught by the Rosicrucians. 

Saturday is Saturn's day and corresponds to the Saturn Period. 

Sunday is the Sun's day and corresponds to the Sun Period. 

Monday is the Moon's day and corresponds to the Moon Period. 

Tuesday is the day of the Norse war-god, Tyr, and corresponds to the Mars-half of the Earth Period. 

Wednesday is the day of the Norse Mercury, Wotan, and corresponds to the Mercury-half to the Earth Period. 

Thursday is the day of Thor, the Norse Jupiter, and corresponds to the Jupiter Period. 

Friday is the day of the Norse Venus, Freia, and corresponds to the Venus Period. 

In addition to the rulership over the days of the week, the planets have dominion in turn over the hours of the day, and the underlying system, order and connection between the rulership of the days and hours become apparent when it is noted that: 

The planet for which any day is named rules the first hour after sunrise on that day. 

Starting with the hour of sunrise on Sunday which is ruled by the Sun, the next hour is allotted to Venus, the third to Mercury. Next come the hours of the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars. Then come other hours ruled by the Sun, by Venus and all the other planets in the order given: Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars. This succession is followed in unbroken sequence to the next Sunday morning when Mars rules the last hour of the week in his proper order and the Sun opens the new week with his beneficent ray. 

Under this arrangement of succession started at sunrise on Sunday, the Moon rules the first hour of Monday, which is the twenty-fifth from the hour of the Sun which ruled Sunday morning. 

Mars rules the first hour on Tuesday which is the twenty-fifth hour from the hour of the Moon which ruled Monday morning. 

And so on, through the other days of the week. This shows how the method of naming the days for the Planetary Spirits which have dominion over them, dovetails with the system of planetary hours, and both are rooted in a foundation of esoteric knowledge. 

When we speak of planetary 'hours,' it must be understood that these hours are not sixty minutes in length, but vary in a wide measure, with the time of the year, and the place of your residence. Near the equator the divergence is least; and it increases the further North we go because a planetary hour is one twelfth part of the time between Sunset on a particular day and Sunrise the next morning, or it is one twelfth part of a particular day beginning at Sunrise and ending at Sunset. 

At the equinoxes when the day and night are of equal length, the planetary hours are also sixty minutes each, but at midsummer and in latitude sixty where the Sun rises at 3 A.M. and sets at 8 P.M. giving a day of seventeen and a night of only seven hours, the planetary hours of the day are ninety-two minutes long against twenty-seven minutes for the night hours. This is reversed in December, for then the Sun does not rise till 9:15 A.M. in latitude sixty North and it sets at 2:45 P.M. with the result that the planetary hours of the day are twenty-seven minutes long, and the night hours ninety-two minutes. 

For the convenience of students we give in the back of this book six tables, and each usable for two months in the year by all who live in latitude 25 to 55 North or South, this being practically the whole civilized world. They are perpetual and may be used a lifetime. 

To find which planet rules a certain hour, look at your timepiece and consult the table for the current month. Run your index-finger down the column for the latitude in which you live. Stop when you come to the first time which is later than the time indicated by your watch. Move up one step. The figure found there indicates that the planetary ruler commenced to rule at that time and will continue in power till the time at which you first stopped. 

The Hour-rulers are found at the intersection of the line containing the time at which they commenced to rule and the column of the proper day of the week. 

To illustrate, if we want to find which planet rules in latitude 40 on Thursday at 2 P.M. during December, we run our index finger down the middle column of latitudes in the table for December, and stop at 2:18 P.M., which is the first figure that is later than we desire. We then move up a step to 1:32 P.M., and thence to the left stopping at the column of Thursday. There we find Mars, and know that that planet rules from 1:32 to 2:18 P.M. on Thursdays, during December and January, in latitudes 35 to 45. 

Regarding the use of the planetary hours, anyone who has studied the nature and influence of the various planets on the affairs of life may readily form an opinion. Experiment and observation will soon make anyone proficient in the choice of the best times for doing the thing desired with the best chance of success. There are many who drag the stars in the gutter by perverted use of their influence for selfish ends, and endeavor to obtain an undue advantage thereby, but students of our literature will not expect to find advice on how to proceed with such a purpose. We have not studied the matter from that angle and would not teach others how, if we knew. But on certain occasions the planetary hours may be justly and beneficently used, and we shall try to indicate how they may be of service. 

Suppose we want to help a friend to obtain employment, and know a place where he would fit in. We remember that the Sun is a significator of those in authority and therefore the hours of the Sun are good in which to transact business with and ask favors of such people; and you will have the best chance of success if you apply at those times. 

But it also is important to remember that the planet which rules the first hour of a given day has prime rulership during that entire day, and that the other planets are only subsidiary rulers with the day ruler. They are weakened or strengthened in proportion to the agreement or disagreement of their natures with the nature of the day-ruler. Thus if you select a Sun-hour on Saturday, which is tinged with the obstructive Saturnine influence, your chances of success are not nearly as good as if you select a Sun-hour on a Thursday, which is tinged throughout with the benevolent ray of its day-ruler, Jupiter. 

Or, if you have occasion as a matter of duty, to reason with someone who has a very short temper who, you know, is apt to resent it and say or do something that you will both wish to avoid, use the cold wet blanket of the Saturn-hour on Saturn's day if possible, to put down and quench the martial spirit. The danger of a rupture will then be minimized to a wonderful extent, and you will probably both wonder with pleasant retrospection how well it went off. 

Or, if it becomes necessary to stir someone who has fallen into habits of idleness wherefrom others are made to suffer, if it seems almost necessary to build a fire under him to make him move, compound the fire and energy of Mars as a day-ruler with his influence as an hour-ruler, by talking to him on Tuesday. He will heed then if it is at all possible to get him started. 

By using the planetary hours on the lines here laid down, for the purpose of unselfish service, you may confer a great many blessings on others and lay up much treasure for yourself in heaven where neither moth nor rust will corrupt; and it is well worth remembering that however much material advantage you may gain by using such knowledge, that material gain, power, position, money and all other things that pertain to this world are left behind when death calls, and that our good deeds alone stand by us in that hour. Therefore do not scoff, but if you want to use these stellar influences, use them so that they will bring you everlasting instead of only temporary gain.

A backward movement of the vernal equinox, which is a very important factor in human affairs. See 'INTELLECTUAL ZODIAC.' 

PROGRESSION: See 'DIRECTIONS and TRANSITS.' 

PRIMARY DIRECTIONS: See 'DIRECTIONS and TRANSITS.'

Pertaining to the horoscope at birth. See 'TRANSITS.' 

RADIX: The horoscope at birth. See 'TRANSITS.' 

RECEPTION: 

Planets are in 'mutual reception' when each occupies the house ruled by the other; as Venus in Aries and Mars in Taurus. The effect depends on the agreement between the natures of the planets. When Mars is in the Mercurial signs Gemini or Virgo and Mercury in the Martial signs Aries or Scorpio, the dynamic energy of Mars is infused into the mental organization of that person who on that account becomes more alert mentally. Whether this alertness manifests erratically or along orderly lines depends upon the aspects of course; all the 'mutual reception' does is to give the energy. If Saturn is in the Mercurial signs Gemini or Virgo, and Mercury in the Saturnine signs Capricorn or Aquarius, the restraining hand of Saturn is laid upon the flighty Mercury with the result that the mind gains in depth and power of concentration, but whether this mental capacity will be used for good or ill, depends on the aspects the same as in the case of Mars. When Venus and Jupiter are in 'mutual reception' and well aspected, it smoothes the path of life most wonderfully. Everywhere the person who has this configuration will find people ready to help, and many friends, but conversely, when Saturn and Mars are in 'mutual reception' and afflicted, he who is so unfortunate will meet rebuff and enmity on every hand. 

It should never be forgotten, however, that our horoscope shows what we have made of ourselves in past lives, and he who has the configuration that attracts friends must have been kind and obliging, while he who draws out the mean side of human nature and makes enemies is himself selfish and unfriendly. But if he will strive to turn from his ways and make some sacrifice for others, he will also in time overcome the undesirable aspects, for the Star Angels are not maliciously bent upon scourging anyone. They only scourge to subdue and correct our faults and make us better. Sometime we shall all be loving and lovable, and then there will be for us no malefic influence. 

RETROGRADATION: 

See chapter on Retrogradation and its effects page 72.  

RIGHT ASCENSION: See 'ASCENSION.' 

RULER: 

The Ruler of a horoscope is that planet which has greatest dominion and influence over the life, and to which the native most readily responds. 

Other things being equal, the Lord of the Ascendant is the Ruler. But if another planet is stronger in the matters of Elevation, Dignity or Exaltation, Position in an Angle, and Aspects, then that planet must be regarded as the Ruler. But for this to hold, the aspects must be close and strong, regardless of whether they are good or bad. Good aspects will make a good Ruler, bad aspects a bad one, and without affecting the fact of rulership in either case. When two planets are about equal in strength and position, they must be classed as co-rulers. 

In the case of a House, the Lord of the sign on the cusp is its Ruler. Where there is an intercepted sign, its Lord has also partial rulership over the house, although it is inferior in this respect to the planet which rules the sign on the cusp. This rulership of an intercepted sign is latent and is not brought out until by progression of the angles the intercepted sign arrives at the cusp of the house. Planets in a house, if aspected, will ordinarily have a greater influence upon its affairs than the rulers of the signs before mentioned. In this case, such planets may be termed co-rulers of the house. 

SECONDARY DIRECTIONS: 

See 'DIRECTIONS and TRANSITS.' 

SEPARATING: 

When a planet which has been in aspect with another moves onward and thus dissolves the aspect, it is said to be separating from that aspect. See 'APPLY.' 

SEXTILE: 

When two planets are sixty degrees apart they are said to be in sextile, so called because sixty degrees are one sixth part of the circle which has 360 degrees. It is considered a 'good' aspect. See 'GOOD AND BAD,' also 'ASPECT.' 

SHORT ASCENSION: See 'ASCENSION.' 

SIDEREAL DAY: 

Is the time which elapses between two successive passages of a fixed star over the meridian of a given place. See chapter on 'Time' page 18. 

SIDEREAL YEAR: 

Is the period of time which elapses between a conjunction of the Sun with any fixed star and its return again to the same conjunction. 

SIGNIFICATOR: 

The Planets, Ascendant, Midheaven, Part of Fortune and the Dragon's Head and Tail are called 'Significators,' because their places and aspects in the horoscope have a certain significant bearing upon the affairs of life. 

SIGNS: 

The signs of the Zodiac are divisions of the heavens beginning at the vernal equinox. The first thirty degrees are called Aries, the next Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. 

These signs are, as said, measured from the vernal equinox, a fluctuating point, and are not to be confused with the twelve constellations of fixed stars which bear the same names, nor with the twelve houses of the horoscope which are divisions of the earth. See 'Intellectual Zodiac' and 'Houses.' 

SOLAR DAY: 

Is the time which elapses between two successive passages of the Sun over the meridian of a given place. See chapter on 'Time' page 18. 

SOLSTICE: 

This word is compounded of the two words, 'sol,' the Sun, and 'sistere,' to make to stand; thus understood, it describes nicely what happens at the solstice, for a solstice is a point at which the Sun is in its highest point of declination and furthest from the celestial equator. There it stands or remains for three days in the twenty-third degree of declination before it begins to descend towards its node. 

There are two solstices. One in midsummer, the 21st of June, which is the longest day in the year, another on the 21st of December, which is the shortest. They are called respectively, the summer and the winter solstice. 

SOUTHERN SIGNS: 

Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces are called Southern Signs because when the Sun is in them, he is South of the celestial equator, and as a result we in the Northern hemisphere have winter. 

SQUARE: 

When two planets are ninety degrees apart they are said to be in square or quartile, because ninety degrees are one-fourth, or quarter of the circle. This aspect is said to be 'bad,' the planetary rays striking each other at a right angle, and therefore being at 'cross' purposes as it were. See 'ASPECTS,' and 'GOOD AND BAD.' 

STATIONARY: 

At times planets move obliquely with reference to the earth's orbit, in such a manner as to appear stationary, though, as a matter of fact they are always moving. See chapter on 'Retrogradation' page 72. 

SUCCEDENT HOUSES: 

The second, fifth, eighth and eleventh houses are called succedent, because they 'succeed' or follow the 'Angles.' 

SUPERIOR PLANETS: 

Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, are so called by Astronomers because they move in orbits which take them to parts of the heavens far from the Sun. The term is used in contradistinction to that of 'inferior planets' as applied to Venus and Mercury which always remain near the Sun. See page 10. 

SYMBOLS: 

The symbols of the planets are given on page 24, and it will be noticed that they consist of a circle, a half circle and a cross variously grouped. The circle is the symbol of the spirit, the half-circle is the emblem of the soul, and the cross represents matter. Thus the elements of the human constitution, Spirit, Soul and Body are enfolded in the component parts of the planetary symbols to show to the Mystic their mission with respect to humanity. These elementary parts are variously grouped to indicate the nature of the planet for which they stand, and its office in the Great School of Life where God has placed us under the Planetary Spirits who are endeavoring to educate us in the Divine Wisdom. 

The Sun, as its symbol indicates is the center of all spiritual faculties, the fountain of all life. 

The Moon's symbol is a half-circle, showing that we have completed the arc of involution where bodies were built, and that now the essence of experience extracted from these vehicles must be transmuted into spiritual qualities by the alchemy of soul-growth, so that we may rise on the arc of evolution. 

Mars' symbol is a cross above the circle, showing the unregenerate man, where the cross of personality is above the circle of spirit. But by trampling the higher nature under foot the martial character engenders war and strife, during which he necessarily suffers even when he is victorious. Thus, by rebuffs the nature is gradually softened. 

Venus: When the martial nature has suffered sufficiently, the spirit circle gradually ascends above the cross of the personality and thus becomes the symbol of Venus, the planet of love. 

Saturn and Jupiter have symbols which are similarly indicative of the manner in which soul-growth is fostered. In the symbol of Saturn the cross of personality is exalted above the signature of the soul, the half-circle. Soul-growth is attained by Service, but the symbol of Saturn shows plainly that the person under his rule is more ready to be served than to serve, and is selfish and obstructive of the common good. Naturally others resent this trait of character, and therefore Saturn brings sorrow, trouble, worry and disappointment in order to teach us that we can never really serve ourselves by selfishness, but only by sacrifice. 

Jupiter: When it has gradually dawned upon us through much sorrow, that selfishness is as a shell around the soul which shuts us off from others, we begin slowly to cultivate the quality of benevolence, and gradually the half-circle of the soul rises above the cross of matter and becomes the symbol of Jupiter, the philanthropist and friend of man. It then signifies one who loves all and one who is equally the favorite of gods and men. 

Mercury: Though the least in the Kingdom of God, the Solar System, it is nevertheless of the greatest importance, on account of its influence upon body, soul and spirit, which is shown by the fact that its symbol contains all the component parts of the planetary symbolism, namely, the circle, half-circle and cross. This is because in the mind all are linked together in one whole physico-spiritual organism called man. Without Mercury this could not be. 

Mercury is neutral however, and it depends upon the indwelling Ego represented by the centrally placed circle whether it will use its divine attributes of choice and free-will to aspire heavenward for soul-growth as symbolized by the signature of the soul, the half-circle, placed above the circle of spirit, or whether it will stoop towards the cross of personality below the circle and wallow in the mire of worldliness. No creature has such divine possibilities as man, none many aspire higher, and conversely, none may fall lower. This struggle between the higher and the lower natures for mastery, symbolized by the half-circle and the cross which are placed above and below the circle in the symbol of Mercury, was well voiced by Goethe in the lines of his immortal "Faust" where the hero says: 

```
"Thou by one sole impulse art posses'd,
Unconscious of the other still remain.
Two souls alas are housed within my breast,
And struggle there for undivided reign.
One to the earth with passionate desire,
And closely clinging organs still adheres,
Above the mists the other doth aspire,
With sacred ardor unto purer spheres."
```

TABLE OF HOUSES: 

A table calculated to show what signs and degrees of the Zodiac are on each of the cusps of the twelve mundane houses at any time during any day or night in the year. 

A table of houses is always the same for a certain degree of latitude, and it may be used for a lifetime as it deals with the fixed stars which show no appreciable motion in a hundred years. 

TRANSITS: 

At the moment a child is born the positions of the planets show the tendencies of the life. Those positions constitute the 'Radix,' and anything that has reference to that 'Root' of all events is called 'radical.' Thus, 'the radical Jupiter' refers to the position of Jupiter at a certain person's birth. 

During the next twenty, thirty or sixty days after birth the planets move on and make certain aspects to the positions held by them at birth. Each of these days corresponds to a year of life, and the aspects formed by the 'progression' on the twentieth day after birth will operate to bring about events in the twentieth year. The aspects formed on the thirty-fifth day after birth will determine the influences in the thirty-fifth year and so on. These are called 'Progressed' positions and Aspects. Thus, if someone says "My progressed Sun will be trine to my radical Jupiter when I am forty," he means that forty days after his birth the Sun had progressed to a trine aspect with the position of Jupiter at his birth, and that therefore this will operate in his fortieth year to bring about events of a fortunate nature, because the aspect and the planets are what is called good. 

As the span of life is usually not more than seventy years, the planetary positions after seventy days from birth do not have as marked an effect as described in the foregoing paragraph, but they have nevertheless an appreciable influence on the lives of mankind, according to their natures. But because of the rapid transit made, the effects are ephemeral, even in the case of the slower planets. These movements of the planets are called 'Transits.' 

They are found in the ephemeris for the current year. That is to say, if you want to know what planets transit the different houses of your horoscope in 1916, you can find them only in the ephemeris for that year. The 'radical' and 'progressed' planets are all in the ephemeris for the year you were born, but the 'transits' for 1920, for instance, can only be found in the ephemeris for 1920. 

Lunations, or New Moons, and eclipses are among the most important transits. Their effect is described under 'lunations,' which see. Next in importance are the transits of the superior planets through the houses. The tenth house signifies social honor. When Jupiter transits it every twelfth year, there will be opportunities for social advancement; when Saturn comes there once in thirty years, look out for setbacks and exert your will to overcome them; and you may judge in like manner about the other planets and houses. 

TRINE: 

When two planets are 120 degrees apart, they are said to be in trine, because 120 degrees is one third part of a circle. This is considered the most harmonious of all aspects. 

TRIPLICITIES: 

The signs of the Zodiac are variously grouped to show certain of their qualities. One method segregates them into four groups of three signs each, each group having affinity for one of the elements: Thus Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are fiery. Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn are earthly. Gemini, Libra and Aquarius are airy, and Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces are watery. These four groups constitute the four Triplicities. 

The fiery triplicity has its apex in the Eastern angle, Aries, where the creative fire commences to produce a body for the spirit to function in the material world. The second angle of this trinity is in the fifth house, which denotes the manner in which the creative force will be used on the physical plane for procreation. It is, therefore, the house of children, occupied by the fiery sign Leo. The line of force running from the Eastern angle in the other direction shows the use to which the creative force is put in the mind. It is, therefore, occupied by the fiery sign Sagittarius and placed in the ninth house, which denotes the higher mind. 

The earthy triangle has its rise, its apex, in the cardinal sign Capricorn, which corresponds to the tenth house, denoting the external environment, the professional and social standing of the person; and as this triplicity is earthy, it deals entirely with the material affairs of the native. Therefore, one line of force goes from it to the sixth house, which is under Virgo, a business sign; hence this house denotes the service which it is expected that the person should perform in the world. Since this service is as much dependent upon bodily health as mental capacity, this house is also the house of sickness. The other line of force, proceeding from Capricorn to the third sign of the earthy triplicity, denotes the emoluments which will be received for the service rendered according to the sixth house, and in the capacity denoted by the tenth house. Therefore the second house ruled by the sign Taurus is the house of finance; and as one's freedom of action depends to a degree upon the state of his finances, this house is also called the House of Liberty. 

The apex of the airy triplicity is in the Western angle occupied by the cardinal sign Libra, which is ruled by the planet of love, Venus. This triplicity is therefore concerned with the different unions possible in human life. The seventh house where it rises properly denotes the most intimate of all those unions, marriage. From that union, other relationships result, and therefore one line of force goes from the seventh house to the third house, occupied by Gemini, the twins. This house therefore denotes brothers and sisters. The other line of force connects the seventh house with the eleventh, signifying the unions of friendship. 

The watery triplicity takes its rise in the northern angle occupied by the cardinal sign Cancer, which is the house of mystery, denoting the latter part of life, the point where the spirit is getting ready to withdraw itself from material existence to take up the activity of the spiritual worlds. It is therefore connected with the eighth house, the house of death, which is occupied by the sign Scorpio. It is significant in the highest degree that this is the negative house of Mars, and that it rules the creative organs. It points out in the most thorough manner, the evanescence of all that is created in the physical world. The other line of force proceeding from the fourth house goes to the sign Pisces, occupying the twelfth house. Pisces, which is composed of two half-circles and a band, shows well the dual nature of man that has run its course in the physical world, but has another evolution to be taken up in unseen realms. This house, therefore, denotes the confinement in which the spirit realizes that it is at the end of life, the sorrow it feels and the self-undoing to which it is sometimes prompted. 

TROPIC: 

'Tropikos' is a Greek word which has a meaning relative to turning, and the tropics of Astronomy are the turning points of the Sun. At the summer solstice the Sun reaches its highest degree of Northern Declination in the sign Cancer; this then is its tropic, for from that point it begins to turn downwards to its Western node, and goes into Southern Declination. It reaches the lowest point of that arc in December at the winter Solstice in the sign Capricorn. This is the other tropic, for there again it turns and commences its next ascent towards the Northern heavens. 

VOID OF COURSE: 

When the planets are so placed that the Moon makes no aspect before leaving the sign she is in at birth, she is said to be 'void of course.' As the Moon is the planet of fecundation which nourishes and nurses the latent potentialities into actualities, the above is an unfortunate condition, for with it, if the Moon is in the beginning of a sign at birth, it leaves the life vapid and void of incentive. 

WATERY SIGNS: 

Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces are called 'watery' signs. Water is the Universal Solvent, and the Universal Coagulant in the alchemical laboratory of nature. On page 28 it is shown how the Sun of Life, the Ego, passes through the waters of parturition in three definite stages symbolized by the watery signs. 

When the Sun is at the highest point of its declination in the psychic watery sign Cancer, designated by the ancient Egyptian priests the sphere of the souls awaiting rebirth, it is at the Throne of the Father, the Fountain of Life. There it draws from that inexhaustible well a new supply of the Elixir Vitae for the coming year, and forthwith commences its descent to bring the treasure to the waiting world. 

But to do this it must first pass through the fire of its own sign Leo, and blend fire and water. Upon the successful performance of this alchemical feat depends all manifested life. 

In October the Sun enters the second of the watery signs, Scorpio, where the energetic Lucifer Spirits of Mars are endeavoring to amalgamate the two antagonistic elements, but not with complete success, for the fire of passion and the waters of emotion seethe, boil and foam in war and strife. Thus the pure essence of life received from our Father in Heaven becomes tainted with passion when dragged through the pool of Scorpio, and to offset this taint it is bathed in the fire of aspiration when the Sun reaches the fiery sign Sagittarius at Christmas. 

In March the Sun's passage through the last of the watery signs, Pisces, raises the sap in the trees, swells the seeds and buds by the expansive ray of the benefic Jupiter till they are ready to burst, and when the Sun of Life enters in exaltation of power the fiery sign Aries, it utters the creative flat and all nature bursts forth in glorious splendor. The Flame of Divine Life germinated and gestated in the watery womb of nature is then manifest in the world. 

ZENITH: 

The highest point in the heavens above the birthplace, where the Sun is at noon, also called the Midheaven. This is the same for all latitudes at a given sidereal time. Thus, if two children were born at the same sidereal time, one in Alaska, the other in Mexico, both would have the same degree of the Zodiac on the Midheaven, but their Ascendants and other cusps would be materially different, causing the planets to be placed in different houses, and making the lives dissimilar in every other respect. See 'Midheaven' and 'Houses.' 

ZODIAC: 

A narrow belt in the heavens extending about eight degrees on either side of the ecliptic or Sun's path. See 'Intellectual Zodiac.'
