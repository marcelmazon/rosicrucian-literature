FOREWORD

These astrological interpretations of horoscopes by
Max Heindel, messenger of the Elder Brothers of the
Rose Cross and founder of The Rosicrucian Fellowship,
first appeared in The Rosicrucian Fellowship Magazine,
Rays from the Rose Cross, during the months from
September, 1915, to October, 1916. They have not
been printed before in book form, but the spiritual basis
of their presentation, along with their clearness and
conciseness, well merit them a wider audience. We
believe that all students of astrology will find a study
of these twenty-eight delineations of special value in
learning to interpret correctly the different aspects of
the planets, as well as to synthesize the chart as a whole.
The wise advice given to the parents of the children
represented is another valuable asset to these readings.

YOUR CHILD'S HOROSCOPE
ADOLPH B. - Born April 20, 1900.
. We judge first his mental characteristics from the
position of Mercury and the Moon, although, of course,
all the other planets have their part in determining
this as well as all other matters.
We find that both Mars and Mercury are in Aries,
the sign of the head; Saturn is square to Mercury. The
presence of Mars in Aries makes people very quick
tempered; they act under impulse and do some very
rash acts which they may regret afterwards. We find
also that the square of Saturn to Mercury will cause
Adolph to hold a grudge and be cruel and sarcastic
in his speech. These tendencies should be checked by
all means possible. It is bad enough to do rash things
on the impulse of the moment, but when anyone nurses
a fancied or even a real grievance, it is impossible to
repair the damage done by being quick tempered.
The native makes himself and those about him very
unhappy.
By all means tell Adolph morning, noon, and night
that whatever happens, he must forget and forgive.
The Moon, which is the other significator of the mind,
is square to Venus and Neptune, and these mental
configurations give him a tendency to suspect every
body. Thus he attracts undesirable conditions to
himself which will make him very unhappy in life
unless he eradicates them or lives above them.


8 YOUR HOROSCOPE
Uranus is in conjunction with Jupiter, and this last
planet is essentially dignified in Sagittarius. These two
planets, in trine to Mercury and Mars, will make
Adolph very inventive, giving him a genius and an
ability far above the average to see things; but there
is not an easy street before him so he can just walk
into fortune and have success open her arms to him
at the very moment he appears. Uranus and Jupiter
are in the 12th house, the house of limitation, sorrow,
trouble, and self-undoing. The good things signified
by any planet in this house are difficult to bring about.
It seems to remain in latency as if there were a wall
round about it to hold it back. Moreover, Saturn, the
planet of obstruction, is intercepted in the first house.
All intercepted signs show things which are in latency
and difficult to bring out. Therefore it would seem
that his environment, signified by the 1st house, will
have the tendency to hold him down. Jupiter and
Uranus, trine Mars and Mercury, will give him plenty
of push; he will always endeavor to do something in
order that he may succeed, but at every turn it will
seem as if something comes up to check his desires and
block his designs.
The Moon square Venus and Neptune, in the 6th
house, which rules labor, will make it very difficult
for him to find employment for anyone else. He may
often meet with treachery on the part of his fellow
employees, and when he has conceived an idea and is
working it out, he will be likely to have it stolen from
him. Therefore he should be very careful not to give


YOUR HOROSCOPE 9
his confidence regarding such matters to anyone, no
matter how fair they may seem to his face.
In the matter of finance, he will experience the
strangest and most unexpected reverses, because Uranus,
the ruler of the 2nd house, is retrograde in the 12th
house. He will never make any great fortune, and at
times he will be brought down to such poverty that
he will be without means of any kind. This may seem
very unfortunate from the ordinary worldly point of
view, but as a matter of fact, when anyone has that
ability which is indicated by Uranus conjunction Jupiter
trine Mercury and Mars, any reverse that he may
suffer will be only temporary, and it will give him
new incentive to go ahead with something else. Money
has no value to the soul, but the experience has, and
in this way he will get much more experience than if
everything went smoothly for him financially.
With respect to health, it is very essential that the
parents should be careful with coughs and colds, for
these are indicated by the square of the Moon to Venus
and Neptune in the sign Gemini, which rules the lungs,
and in the 6th house, which rules health. Nearly
everybody is too careless with a cold, thinking of it as
something that will right itself without trouble upon
their part. And it does in some cases; but where there
is a weak spot, it behoves us to be particularly careful
not to cultivate conditions that may aggravate the
matter. The square of Saturn to Mercury in Aries
also gives him a tendency to very severe headaches
and congestion of blood in the head. If he is taught


10 YOUR HOROSCOPE
some easily appropriate exercises which will keep the
muscles of the neck in proper shape, this will be greatly
ameliorated; but the temper spoken of in the opening
paragraph will be a greater factor in bringing on this
disability than anything else. Therefore, if he is taught
to hold himself in check and obtain self-control he
will also lighten, if not entirely do away with, this
tendency.

MURILLO B. - Born June 11, 1911, Los Angeles, Cal.

At the time of Murillo's birth, Cancer was rising,
with Venus and Mercury on the Ascendant. This gives
him a dreamy, artistic temperament which is apt to
make it difficult for him to get through life. Saturn
was just going down in the west and is therefore in
opposition to Mercury. This makes him timid and
gives him a very poor memory. This aspect also gives
him a tendency to disregard the truth. In fact, if this
configuration of Saturn to Mercury were alone and
not off-set by something else, he would be very un-
truthful; but the Moon in conjunction and parallel
to Uranus and Jupiter makes him intuitional and gives
him more honorable characteristics. Thus there is
good reason to hope that he may outgrow the evil
tendency, especially if you ar equite strict with him
in respect always to telling the truth. Then by the
help of the last named configuration, he will be able
to overcome the evil effect of Saturn opposition
Mercury.


YOUR HOROSCOPE 11
Mars is the most elevated planet in the horoscope;
that is to say, it was near the zenith at the time of his
birth. This planet in Taurus, the sign of the voice,
makes him very quarrelsome, and the sextile to Venus
from the house of friends gives him the tendency to
rule his friends, particularly his young girl friends, with
a rod of iron; and strange to say, they will submit and
seem to like it and will be loyal to him in spite of
anything he may say or do. Thus his best and closest
friends will be girls, for the boys will never submit to
him in that respect.
The Sun and Neptune are in conjunction in
Gemini, the sign of the hands, shoulders, and arms,
showing that the artistic ability of Venus on the
Ascendant will particularly express itself along the
lines of music on stringed instruments. It will not be
necessary for him to study music. The moment, almost,
that he takes up an instrument he will be able to play
upon it, and his ability is very superior and inspirational.
Unfortunately these significators are situated in the
12th house, the house of sorrow, trouble, and self-
undoing. The indolence engendered by the opposition
of Saturn to Mercury, which latter planet is also in the
12th house, will prevent him from pushing to the front
and obtaining recognition before the public, if the
tendency is allowed to run unchecked.
Saturn, the ruler of the 7th house, is also in the
6th, curtailing his chances of obtaining employment of
the faculty which he has so well in hand; and the Sun,
which rules the 2nd house, the department of life that


12 YOUR HOROSCOPE
deals with finance and the emolument we receive for
our services, is in the 12th house, imprisoned, as it were.
Therefore the indications are that Murillo will have a
very difficult time getting the proper public recognition
of the faculty which he undoubtedly possesses, and
when he does get a hearing, it will be difficult for him
to obtain the financial remuneration his talents deserve.
Moreover, there is the tendency indicated by Mars
sextile to Venus that he will spend his money too freely
on lady friends.
All these things the parents should consider and
direct their educational efforts in such a manner as to
off-set them from the earliest childhood. Encourage
him always to seek the society of boys, try to get him
to understand, as soon as possible, the value of a dollar,
that it should not be squandered foolishly. Above
everything, try to push him to the front. No one can
make a position for him, or succeed in life, unless he
has the faculty of meeting others and being pleasant
to them. He has much to help him, also, in respect
to overcoming these undesirable traits, for Jupiter, the
planet of joviality, who greets everyone with a "hail
fellow well met" attitude, is essentially dignified in his
own sign, Sagittarius. He is in the 5th house, which
governs pleasure and public entertainments; he is in
conjunction with Uranus and the Moon, so there is
much to give aid against the evil configurations.
With respect to health, Saturn in Capricorn shows
a tendency toward stiff knees on account of lack of
synovial fluid; the sextile of Mars to Venus in Cancer,


YOUR HOROSCOPE 13
the sign of the stomach, shows that he will always be
fond of the pleasures of the table and will have the
tendency to overeat. This should be very strictly guarded
against, because Saturn in opposition to Mercury in
Cancer shows that unless his appetite is curbed he will
be subject to one of the most miserable diseases, namely,
nervous indigestion. People who suffer from this malady
are a burden to themselves and to everyone else in their
environment. Therefore it cannot be told Murillo too
often to eat sparingly and with discrimination. In
starting young to cultivate this habit of frugality he
may escape many years of great suffering.

DOROTHY K. – Born Nov. 28, 1890, 8:20 A.M.,
London, England.
One of our English students, A. M. Davidson, sends
us the following account of the miraculous cure of
Miss Dorothy Kerin of London, who had been bed-
ridden for many years suffering from advanced tuber-
culosis and kidney disease. She became blind, deaf,
and dumb, and was at the point of death, when sud-
denly, through a vision with warm healing hands, she
was cured and has been well ever since.
As our friend has sent us her figure, we think it may
interest our readers to know what the stars have to say.
In this nativity Sagittarius 13 is ascending, with
Sun, Mercury, Venus, and the Dragon's Tail.
Jupiter, the ruling planet, is sextile to Mercury and


14 YOUR HOROSCOPE
the Sun, and Mars is sextile to Venus. Thus we see
that this is a very gentle, idealistic, and lovable charac-
ter, but Venus is in conjunction with the Dragon's Tail,
which has a saturnine influence, and both Mercury and
Venus are square to Saturn. Hence it is inevitable
that much sorrow and suffering will come in this life
and cloud it with gloom. Whenever Mercury, the
significator of the mind, is afflicted by Saturn, the
planet of obstruction, there is naturally a gloomy con-
dition and a tendency to look upon the dark side of
life. But we can never judge anything in a horoscope
from one configuration. All aspects must be considered
in their bearing upon any subject and thus a synthesis,
or balance, of influence will be obtained. The sextile
of Mars to Venus and Mercury gives fortitude to the
mind, thus helping to offset the sinister influence of
Saturn. The Moon, which is the other significator of
the mind, is in the mercurial sign Gemini, trine to
Uranus. This accounts for the evolution of the super-
normal faculties of which we hear in the history of this
case, and the conversion of these latent faculties to
dynamic powers is also presaged by the trine of
Jupiter, the planet of benevolence and idealism, to
Neptune, the planet of spirituality; and by balancing
these testimonies we see in this young woman a soul
of a gentle, kindly, and idealistic nature whose latent
spiritual faculties are nearly ripe, and almost ready to
be converted into usable powers under the proper
stellar impact.
With respect to the health, it is recorded that she


YOUR HOROSCOPE 15
became afflicted with tuberculosis, also that she lost
her sight, hearing, and speech. The Sun and Mercury
are in the sign Sagittarius close to the nebular spot
called Antares, and the Sun is in opposition to Neptune.
This is the cause of the weak sight. The 12th house
indicates the restrictive influences in life, and when
Mercury, the significator of sense, is there in conjunction
with the Sun, as is the case in the present horoscope,
we have a limiting influence which affects the hearing.
It is curious to note that Neptune, the octave of Mer-
cury, is in the sign Gemini, ruled by Mercury and in
opposition to the Sun. Therefore it helps to awaken
the spiritual hearing which is also recorded in connec-
tion with this case. This configuration would not have
been able to do this alone, and the hearing obtained
would have been of an undesirable nature, but it helps
the configuration of the Moon trine Uranus, which
opens up the super-normal faculties as already stated.
Taurus rules the throat and larynx, but Mercury gov-
erns the air which stirs the vocal cords. Here we find
that Taurus is on the cusp of the 6th house, denoting
sickness, and Venus, the ruler, is on the Ascendant in
conjunction with the saturnine influence of the Dragon's
Tail, which also afflicts Mercury by its conjunction;
hence the weakness of the vocal organs, and the conse-
quent loss of speech is indicated by their square to
Saturn. Neptune in the sign Gemini, which governs
the lungs, in opposition, to the Sun, is responsible for
the affliction of tuberculosis.
It would seem almost impossible that one so sorely


16 YOUR HOROSCOPE
afflicted could ever be healed, but on Sunday, February
18, 1912, the Clock of Destiny struck the hour of her
relief. At that time the progressed Sun was 28 degrees
of Sagittarius. It had therefore passed the opposition
to the radical Moon which was sextile to Uranus at
birth. This is an influence under which a sudden
turn of a beneficial nature might be expected, but the
planets alone cannot bring this about. The Moon, or
lunar tion, is the minute hand on the Clock of Destiny,
and on that very day the new Moon occurred in 28
degrees of Aquarius, trine to the Moon and Uranus
at birth, and sextile to the progressed Sun. This was
a very powerful occult influence, and on that very day
Jupiter, the ruler of the figure, also transited the
Ascendant. Thus there were a number of most extra-
ordinary influences to account for the miracle which
then took place in her recovery.
Following is the history of the case, as given by our
friend in England:
"Many there are who refuse to believe there is any
such thing as a ‘miracle'. They are probably right.
A miracle is not supernatural. It is merely, usually,
an activity of superphysical forces which are not yet
understood by the world in general. Such ‘miracles'
occur constantly in connection with the patients of
The Rosicrucian Fellowship - probably every day, if
the truth were known. But of the many extraordinary
happenings which have thrust themselves upon a skep-
tical world of late years, probably none is so well
authenticated or has received so much of the attention


YOUR HOROSCOPE 17
of scientific men as that known on this side of the
'herring pond' as the 'Kerin Miracle Case'. On Sun-
day, February 18, 1912, Miss Dorothy Kerin, who had
lain for some years bed-ridden suffering from advanced
tuberculosis, kidney disease, and, latterly, from blind-
ness and loss of speech, with a temperature sometimes
rising to 105, was suddenly and completely cured by
an angelic visitation.
"The following particulars were supplied by her
mother: 'A strange fact in the recovery is that for a
few days immediately before it, Dorothy appeared
to become rapidly worse than ever she had been in the
preceding five years of her illness. A few days before
she had lost both hearing and sight. We did not think
she could live through the day. My husband and I,
with some other friends and relations, were gathered
around her bed about 8 P.M. on Sunday, expecting
it to be her deathbed. She suddenly gave a great sigh,
and we thought she was gone. But with a wonderful
smile which none of us can ever forget, she stretched
out her arms and held them out for a few moments.
Then she lay still for a while. Presently her lips moved,
she stretched out her arms again, and then drew her
hands over her eyes, always smiling in that wonderful,
unearthly way. Her terrible weakness, due to tuber-
culosis and diabetes, had made her almost a skeleton.
And then we saw a miracle before our eyes. She looked
at us, her eyes at first squinting, and then becoming
quite natural in expression. I asked her, 'Dolly, do you
know me?' 'Of course I do, Mummy'. We were all


18 YOUR HOROSCOPE
amazed. She then sat up and cried, ‘I am to get up’.
She seemed to be under some mysterious influence.
‘You can’t get up, my darling,’ said I, ‘you are too
weak.’ But when we brought a wrapper, she swung
her legs from the bed and walked about. She was
much calmer than we were. One man present was a
professed atheist. He fell on his knees and sobbed aloud’.
“Miss Dorothy Kerin, interviewed in her mother’s
presence, said concerning the healing ‘Vision’: “It
seemed like a great golden flame above me, with two
hands stretched out, warm hands, and a voice spoke,
saying, Dorothy, your sufferings are over; get up, you
can walk. And then I could see and walk and am well.
I am sure it is a miracle’. Her doctor would not
believe it when he was informed but had to admit
on examining her that she was entirely free from or-
ganic disease!
“The case is so thoroughly well authenticated as
to be absolutely indisputable. Miss Kerin’s pathological
condition was vouched for not only by her regular
medical attendant, Dr. Norman, but also by the St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital, St. Peter’s Home for Incur-
ables at Kilburn, and other institutions, she having been
sent home two years ago as a hopeless case. Scores
of doctors have since seen her, and her case is well
known in the profession. Her brother said that during
the later stages of her illness, when her normal facul-
ties declined, Dorothy developed supernormal faculties
and could, for instance, give an account of what was
happening to her brother at a distance from home.


YOUR HOROSCOPE 19
Care had to be exercised in speaking of her in other
rooms as she could then hear, although deaf to those
who spoke to her at her bedside.
"An independent statement of the case, for those
who are further interested, may be found in Dr. E. L.
Ash's Faith and Suggestion. Miss Kerin, to the writer's
knowledge, is apparently quite well and strong today.
She spoke at a great religious conference in the North
of England recently, and last month delivered a lecture
before a London Occult Society, What I know of the
Effect of Prayer as a Healing Factor. How I was Cured.
It need scarcely be added that Miss Kerin is of a very
religious disposition, and even during her illness she
was so patient and gentle, and suffered all things gladly
as to quickly endear her to all with whom she came
in contact. Miss Kerin was offered quite large sums
to appear on the music-hall stage, but regarding this
as a prostitution of the evidence of divine grace, it
was refused."
EDITOR'S NOTE – The above appearel in the Oct.,
1915, issue of the RAYS. In 1953 we printed further
information concerning the healing activities of Miss
Kerin from the time of her "visitation" to that year.
This information was supplied by Dr. John G. Banks,
who had been in contact with her from 1929 to 1953.
In the May, 1960, issue of our RAYS, mention was made
of the laying of the foundation stone for a new healing
chapel by Miss Kerin.


20 YOUR HOROSCOPE
LITTLE MISS FH. — Born April 3, 1915.
This is a rather difficult horoscope of a strange
child; you remember how Faust says:
"Two souls, alas, are housed within my breast;
One to earth with passionate desire
And closely clinging garments still adheres.
Above the mist the other does aspire
With sacred ardor unto purer spheres".

There is just such a markedly dual nature in this
horoscope, almost amounting to two distinct and sepa-
rate personalities. We find one shown by the planets
in Pisces: Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury. This
represents the lower and more pleasure loving nature.
The other, higher self, is represented by the Moon
sextile to Uranus and trine to the Sun, which is also
sextile to Uranus. These two natures are so different
from each other, so antagonistic, that there is going to
be a life of struggle in which now one, now the other,
will gain the ascendancy. Besides these aspects, note
that the sign Capricorn is rising, with the ruler, Saturn,
in the 6th house and square to Mars. This will make
her discontented; she will never know which side to
lean toward, and she will rebel against the restraint
which is due to present social conditions of the world.
The Moon in the sign Sagittarius makes people very
restless and causes them to travel from one place to
another; "far fields" always look green to them, and
this restlessness permeates the whole nature. There is,


YOUR HOROSCOPE 21
on account of the position of Venus, Jupiter, and Mer-
cury in Pisces, a strong tendency toward musical ex-
pression, but whether this will be brought out or not
depends upon whether she can be made to settle down
to actual study; for the Moon in Sagittarius, squaring
Venus and also Jupiter, the ruler of Sagittarius, will
make this exceedingly doubtful.
There is no doubt that she is an advanced soul, but
on that account she also affords a very difficult prob-
lem to handle, and the main care of the parents should
be directed to settling her down to one course or
another. Naturally, the pleasure loving side of her
character, the fondness for good clothes given by Moon
square Venus; the love of good things to eat and drink,
shown by Mars, Jupiter, and Venus in Pisces, are the
main things which the parents will have to combat
during the earliest years. When the age of puberty
has brought the Ego some realization of its destiny, the
fight within herself will begin, and the Sun, sextile
Uranus and trine Moon, will then commence to exert
an influence for good. There also is considerable help
from Capricorn on the Ascendant, to overcome the
Sagittarius tendency of restlessness. If the parents
work upon her in the early years and get her to settle
down to certain, definite lines of conduct and study,
this influence will be marked in the later years and
give her great aid in overcoming the Pisces side of her
personality.

With regard to health, we note that Saturn is in
the sign Gemini, which rules the lungs. We see also


22 YOUR HOROSCOPE
that he is square to Mars from the watery sign Pisces.
This will give a tendency to coughs and colds, and
if these are neglected, the lungs may become affected.
There is, however, no cause for apprehension, because
the Sun and Mars are in parallel, and this will give
her such wonderful recuperative powers that, although
she may be down to the verge of death, she will pick
up just as quickly.
But astrology not only tells us that she will be subject
to coughs and colds, but it also gives the causes of
the trouble. We find here that the Moon is square
to Venus, and Jupiter is in conjunction with Mars;
Venus, Mars, and Jupiter being in the watery sign
Pisces. This gives a marked tendency toward indul-
gence of the appetites, and it is a well known fact that
coughs and colds are mostly due to overeating. She
must, therefore, be taught from the very earliest child-
hood not to gratify this appetite, because the system
cannot throw off an excess of nutriment. No matter
how much she may plead and she will be an adept at
that, because of the conjunction of Mercury and Jupiter,
the parents must let reason rule. In later years the
side of her nature expressed by Mars conjunction
Mercury will come out and sharpen the tongue, but
there also they must stand firm, so that neither on
account of pleading nor of scolding they give in to this
desire for an excess of food, for that will cause most
of her physical troubles. The foregoing is aggravated
by Neptune in Cancer.


YOUR HOROSCOPE 23

DON B. - Born April 12, 1906.

Here we have a little fellow who was born just
about the time of the San Francisco earthquake. The
planets were then in a very afflicted condition; but
fortunately he had Leo rising and all the planets, with
the exception of two, above the earth. The Sun is
exalted in Aries, and Mars is close to the MC. This
will give him strength, so that, although there are many
afflictions, he will be able to survive them all and
hold his own.

Besides, when we speak of an afflicted horoscope,
it is really something over which we should rejoice
from the Ego's standpoint. Squares bring soul growth,
and a child with a horoscope like this is bound to rise
in the world and make his mark in spite of drawbacks.
He is far better off than a child with a wishy-washy
horoscope that has no afflictions which, by being over-
come, will generate the spiritual muscle, as physical
exercise generates bodily strength and vigor.
Mercury, the significator of mind, is square to
Uranus and Neptune. This will make him slow to
grasp things intellectually; but Mercury sextile Jupiter
and trine Moon will more than offset that. There is
also Saturn trine Neptune and sextile Uranus. Nep-
tune is the octave of Mercury and governs the logical
understanding of spiritual problems, while Uranus is
the octave of Venus and governs the intuition. This
will raise his understanding of things to a plane which


24 YOUR HOROSCOPE

is above the intellectual, yet not altogether dependent
upon intuition. He will know things without having
a reason, but he will also know the reason for his
conclusions. The Sun is exalted in Aries, and Venus
is esentially dignified in Taurus; both are in the 9th
house and thus they serve to enlighten the mind and
give it kindliness. This will also give him very high
ideals and make him very sympathetic.

The presence of Mars in Taurus, which governs
the larynx, has a tendency to make people cruel in
speech, but as Mars is not aspected at all, this tendency
will probably will not come to the front. If it does it
will only be on rare occasions, for Venus is also in
that sign.

The trine of Mercury to the Moon imparts a sort
of dreamy nature to the mentality and the presence
of the Sun and Venus in the 9th house also gives
something of that same nature. Taken together, they
indicate that Don will be able to express himself most
beautifully in poetry. There is great probability that
he will take up literature for a vocation and his writings
will be of a strange nature, on account of this unusual
mentality. Venus being in Taurus, the sign of voice,
and so close to the MC aspected by Neptune and
Uranus, makes it very probable that he will also express
himself orally on the lecture platform, and the aspect
to Neptune and Uranus makes it appear likely that his
lectures will have to do with occult subjects.

This child has brought such noble ideals and char-
acteristics with him from the past that it is really un-


YOUR HOROSCOPE
25
necessary to warn the parents to look after him in any
respect. He will find himself, unaided, and he will
never go very wrong as far as the moral and mental
life is concerned; but with respect to the physical,
there is considerable to be guarded against in order
to make life as pleasant as possible for him, for there
are a number of afflictions.
Jupiter governs the arterial circulation and it is in
Gemini, the sign of the lungs. It is square the planet
Saturn, which is the obstructer in life, and in a very
weak opposition to the Moon, which from that place
governs the tidal flow of the air in the lungs. Thus
it is seen that Don should be taught to breathe well
and deeply, because otherwise there may be obstruc-
tion in the lungs and the blood will not be well oxy-
genated. This would, naturally, impair the system.
Neptune and Uranus are in opposition from the signs
Cancer and Capricorn, and squared by Mercury, which
rules the nerves. Cancer is the sign of the stomach,
and therefore we see that there is a tendency to nervous
indigestion. From this fact we also reason that the
impaired digestion gives rise to the colds and coughs
previously mentioned as likely to obstruct the lungs.
Don should be very careful of his food and endeavor
to strengthen his body by breathing exercises. If these
exercises are given him from childhood there is no
doubt he will outgrow the tendency because the Sun
is elevated and exalted in Aries. This will overcome
almost anything that is detrimental to health.


26 YOUR HOROSCOPE
CHESTER R. - Born June 20, 1909, 3:15 p.m.,
Chicago.

In this horoscope we find four fixed signs on the
angles and Saturn sextile to Mercury. This makes
Chester very determined by nature and no matter what
may be the obstruction in his path he will persist in
order to gain his point. However, Mars is also square
to Mercury, chief significator of mind. This configura-
tion sharpens the mind, but gives him at times a certain
impulsiveness and makes him argumentative and sar-
castic, also very quick to resent insults, real or fancied.
The nature balances between these two points: Saturn
sextile Mercury, which gives tact, diplomacy, caution,
and persistence, and Mars square Mercury, which shows
a tendency in exactly the opposite direction. At times
he will show one side and at times the reverse. The
Moon, another significator of mind, is un-aspected;
therefore he will have very little imagination. As
Mercury is in its own sign Gemini, though, he will be
a good reasoner, quick to learn, and the dynamic energy
infused by Mars will help him to put into practice the
things which he has learned.

There is, however, another side to this nature which
may endanger his welfare if he follows it. This is
indicated by Saturn square to Uranus, Venus, and
Neptune. The Moon, Venus, and Neptune are in the
ninth house, and Venus and Neptune are in the
psychic sign Cancer, while Saturn is in Aries, the sign
of the head. The ninth house position of the three


YOUR HOROSCOPE 27
planets makes the person a great dreamer both by night
and by day. He sees visions and is very sensitive to
psychic conditions about him. The affliction of Saturn
from the sign of the head makes this faculty dangerous
if it should ever gain the upper hand. Neptune
signifies the beings in the unseen world, and should
Chester ever leave the path of reason indicated by
Saturn sextile Mercury, and respond to this condition
shown by Saturn square to Neptune, he will become
hopelessly entangled in the maze of mediumship. The
consequences to him from a mental standpoint might
be quite serious. Therefore, you should be very careful
never to allow him to enter any place where phenomena
are being produced, such as spiritualistic seances and
circles. The path of logic and reason is the only one
that will carry him safely through. He needs a strong
hand, especially in childhood, to keep his feet on earth.
Neptune conjunction Venus indicates musical talent
and ability, and as Venus is also sextile to Jupiter, and
Jupiter rules the second house, music may be his voca-
tion. At any rate, you may rest assured that his financial
fortunes will be very good. Saturn in Aries rules par-
ticularly the pneumogastric nerve, which supplies the
heart and digestive tract. Its function is to inhibit or
retard the action of the heart, and Saturn in Aries is
particularly obstructive to that nerve; therefore the
heart action is not very good. This testimony is fur-
ther strengthened by the fact that the Sun, which rules
Leo, the sign of the heart, is not aspected, but the
trouble is not really due to a defective heart. The real


28 YOUR HOROSCOPE
cause will be overeating, for Jupiter is in Virgo, the
sign ruling the intestines, sextile to Venus in Cancer,
ruling the stomach. This configuration will make
Chester very fond of good food and plenty of it, but
Saturn square to Venus in Cancer, and Venus con-
junction to Neptune, are strong indications of digestive
trouble. As repeated many times previously, however,
the horoscope shows only the tendencies; whether
we follow them or not lies with us, and parents have
a very strong influence over their children during the
first seven years. The habits then formed usually remain
through life, and this is your opportunity to help your
child. Apply the ounce of prevention so that he may
not have to take the pound of cure. Be sure that you
give him only the very simplest food, and be certain
that you do not give him too much. Remember that
during these first seven years the law of the child's life is
imitation. He cannot help imitating any more than
water can help running down hill, and it does no good
to preach to him and to tell him what he ought to do
and why he ought to do it, because he has no mind
wherewith to reason. At that time, if you eat rich food
and deny him, he will form the secret wish to have
what he is denied now, and at some time in the future
he will gratify his appetite to his hurt. Cold in the
head, and a catarrhal condition should also be guarded
against.


YOUR HOROSCOPE 29
VIOLA S. — Born Sept. 29, 1909, 8 a.m., Minne-
sota.

Viola is a musical name, and there is every indica-
tion in this horoscope that the name fits the person
splendidly, for Libra, a sign of music and of voice, is
rising with Mercury, the planet which governs speech,
right on the ASC, and Venus, the ruler of Libra, is
trine to Neptune in the watery, emotional, and psychic
sign Cancer. This will give Viola unusual ability for
music, particularly on stringed instruments; a good
voice is also indicated.

Venus is in Scorpio near the cusp of the second
house; therefore we may infer that Viola will make
her living through her vocal and musical ability and
that she will derive a good income therefrom. There
are no indications of riches, however, for Venus in
Scorpio always gives the tendency to spend money as
fast as it comes because persons of this nature love the
beautiful things of life and these things cost money.
Like most musicians and people with the artistic tem-
perament, Viola will not be a very good reasoner, but
Neptune in the psychic sign Cancer in the ninth house
governs the higher mind, and Uranus in the house of
the concrete mind shows that she will get things in-
spirationally. She will be apt to float among the clouds
and care little or nothing for the daily tasks which fill
the concrete existence of the ordinary woman. Saturn
is square to Neptune and Uranus in the house of mind.
This is an affliction which shows that Viola will not


30
YOUR HOROSCOPE
always be reliable in her conclusions; therefore, she
should be taught as much as possible to keep her feet
on the earth and not allow herself to float away in
dreamland or jump to conclusions for which she can
give no reason.
The opposition of Uranus to Neptune in the
psychic sign Cancer, squared by Saturn from Aires, the
sign which rules the head, is an indication of medium-
ship, which by all means ought to be checked. Never
allow Viola to enter into a seance or circle nor to
associate with people who have spiritualistic tendencies,
for people with the above-mentioned configuration are
a very easy prey to spirit controls. Once these
entities get a power over anyone it is more than difficult
to shake them off. The ounce of prevention is worth
many pounds of cure.
Saturn and the Moon are in Aries and the sixth
house, which governs health. This shows an impeded
blood circulation and consequent headaches, which may
be avoided by plenty of exercise and attention to
elimination of waste, particularly by the urinary system,
governed by Libra. As the father is a doctor he will
know how to look after this matter and prevent any
tendencies from manifesting and becoming aggravated
for want of proper attention.
There are two oppositions in this horoscope. Mars
opposition Jupiter, and Moon opposition Sun. Both
Jupiter and the Sun are in the eleventh house, which
signifies friends, hopes, and aspirations. No configura-
tion could be more fortunate than this, for it shows that
Viola will attract good, faithful, and influential friends


YOUR HOROSCOPE 31
who will be able to benefit her greatly and make her
life very happy. But besides the characteristics which
will draw these friends to her there is another side to
her nature indicated by Mars in Pisces and the Moon
in Aries. The Moon in Aries will make her vacillating
and restless, chafing at restraint, impulsive, aggressive,
and sometimes supercilious toward others. This will
bring to her enmity and jealousy shown by Mars in
Pisces. Secret enemies will endeavor to slander her
and undermine her position, causing considerable an-
noyance. If she can be shown this early in life and
taught to respond to Saturn in Aries rather than to
the Moon in Aries, the diplomatic side of her nature
will be cultivated and save her much trouble and an-
noyance. But taken as a whole this should be more
than an ordinarily fortunate life, for there is not only
soul growth and experience, but there is also a consid-
erable slice of happiness indicated in this figure.

ETHEL J. Born Jan. 27, 1911, 2:10 p.m., Bay-
onne, New Jersey.

This horoscope was sent in and aspects calculated
by the parents, but we note that they make use of semi-
sextiles, semi-squares, and allow an orb of influence of
seven or more degrees in some cases. This will not do.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and in actual
practice we find that there is absolutely no flavor to
these fancy aspects or long orbs. Six degrees ought to


32 YOUR HOROSCOPE
be taken as a maximum both for the Sun and the
planets, and there are just six aspects that work, viz.:
opposition, conjunction, square, trine, sextile, and
parallel. The other so-called aspects only complicate
and befog the subject.
The Moon and Mercury, the significators of the
mind, are in an angle, in the cardinal sign Capricorn,
and sextile Jupiter. A sign and its ruler are naturally
of the same nature, that is what constitutes the har-
mony between them. Therefore, the sign Capricorn
is saturnine in its influence and when Mercury and
the Moon, these wandering orbs which signify the
restless mind, are found therein, they are truly benefited
by the influence of Saturn or a saturnine sign. This
position will therefore make Ethel diplomatic, serious,
thoughtful, and practical. Her habits will be orderly
and thrifty in general, but if she ever indulges in any
speculation she is sure to lose, for Neptune is on the
second cusp in opposition to Uranus in the eighth
house, showing that her financial fortunes will be sub-
ject to adverse circumstances.
People with the Sun in Aquarius are very strong
in their likes and dislikes, and as the Sun is close to
the ninth house this aspect will govern her mentality
to a considerable extent; in religion, for instance, she
will be very narrow and set on account of Sun square
Saturn. This aspect will also give her much trouble
through false pride. Be sure to do your very utmost
to correct these two tendencies for there is nothing
that hampers the spirit so much as religious intolerance


YOUR HOROSCOPE 33
and false pride. There is no doubt that she is going
to be a smart woman. Mars, the great fountain of
dynamic energy, trine to Saturn, the persistent and
practical planet, the Moon conjunct Mercury and
sextile Jupiter, the great benevolent, philanthropic, and
humane planet, are all testimonies that she will have
a vast fund of energy, mental rather than physical,
which she will expend for the good and welfare of
others. Everybody will look up to her and look to
her in their trials and troubles. They will always find
a sympathetic ear and helpful advice. She will make
the fortunes of other people and, as said, be very popular
on that account, but she will feel in her own heart the
great value of all she will do and this will, from the
religious point of view, detract from her soul growth.
If she can be taught in the earliest years to minimize
her estimation of what she does, everybody will like
her all the better.
The Sun is significator of marriage for a woman.
It is square to Jupiter in the fifth house, and Jupiter
is in conjunction with the saturnine Dragon's Tail.
This is bad for courtship. It obstructs and frustrates.
The young men will feel her superiority in such a
manner that they will not readily take courage to
approach her with offers of marriage, and as Scorpio
is in the sixth house there will be a tendency to over-
indulgence of the passions when marriage has been
accomplished. Be sure that you instruct her regarding
this matter, for the Sun square to Saturn shows
that there is none too much vitality and she cannot


34 YOUR HOROSCOPE
afford to waste it in undue indulgence of the lower
nature.
Regarding the health, we find that Mars is in Sagit-
tarius in the sixth house. This predisposes to accidents
and broken bones. More people are hurt during child-
hood in reckless play than at any other time of life;
therefore, do your best to keep an eye on Ethel in this
respect. The Sun rules Leo, and therefore the heart;
consequently its square to Saturn and Jupiter is an
indication that care is needed. Do not allow Ethel
to run too much and overexert herself in that way. If
children could only be kept from the 'thoughtless ex-
penditure of energy during early life there would not
be so much trouble and weakness in later years. But
"forewarned is forearmed," and you may save her a
great deal of trouble by timely precaution. Saturn is in
the sign Taurus, which governs the throat, and there-
fore she is also liable to colds and sore throat; you
should either strive to inure her in that respect, or
see that she is not exposed.

ROBERTA A. - Born March 7, 1909. 7 p.m.,
Columbia, Tenn.

This is the horoscope of a difficult child, for there
are four cardinal signs on the angles, and Mars makes
a considerable number of aspects. Mercury and the
Moon, the significators of mind, are unaspected. This


YOUR HOROSCOPE 35
shows that Roberta will have a tendency to act from
impulse rather than reason, that she will start to do a
hundred things with unexcelled enthusiasm but fail to
carry any of them through. This is a tendency which
ought to be repressed with all the persistence which the
parents can bring to bear. When she undertakes to do
anything she should be spurred and encouraged by
every means in your power to carry that thing to
completion.

Although the Moon and Mercury, which are the
significators of mind, are unaspected, Roberta is not
what you would call a dull child. In fact, she is the
very reverse, for the Sun is trine to Neptune, the octave
of Mercury, in the psychic sign Cancer, and sextile to
Uranus, the planet of intuition. This will give her what
you might almost call a sixth sense.

She will arrive at conclusions without the slow pro-
cess of reasoning things out. Mercury is also placed
in the intellectual sign Aquarius and it goes before the
Sun as light bearer. But the idea is this: that Roberta
arrives at her conclusions with such lightning rapidity
that it takes both herself and the people around her
off their feet, and she thinks she can do things in the
same way in the physical world as in the mental. Im-
mediately she has planted a seed, she will expect to see
the flower bloom without going through the tedious
process of cultivating the soil or watering the plant.
Be sure that you hold her down in that respect, for
this is essential to her happiness and success in life.
Jupiter in the mercurial sign Virgo sextile to Nep-


36 YOUR HOROSCOPE
tune, the planet of spiritual perception, and trine to
Uranus, the planet of intuition, will also contribute to
this intuitive phase of her mental life.
Another thing that will contribute to giving Ro-
berta trouble during life is her temper. Mars conjunc-
tion Uranus in a cardinal sign will make this unfor-
tunate characteristic break out at the most inopportune
time like a "bolt from the blue," and the square of
Uranus and Mars to Saturn shows that she will be
very bitter and inclined to hold spite. This is such an
unfortunate characteristic that it should be corrected
by whatever means possible, for it saps the very life of
the poor souls who are thus afflicted. I believe the
only way to overcome this is by cultivating the devo-
tional side of her nature. Jupiter, the planet of benevo-
lence and altruism, is sextile to Neptune, trine to
Uranus and Mars. By playing upon that string you
may do a great deal for Roberta.
If you have not already begun family worship morn-
ing and evening you should inaugurate it for your
child's sake. Get the stories of the saints and their lives
for her and appeal always to the kindly nature which
in her is hidden behind a brusque exterior. Probably
you may bring that hidden side of her nature forth
and then you will find a lovely character. The gentle
Venus is ruler of her Ascendant, Libra, but Mars by
his many aspects has usurped the place of rulership.
He will be a prominent factor in her life unless he is
prevented as said. So it is your work to help her
dethrone the tyrant Mars and exalt the lovely Venus.


YOUR HOROSCOPE 37
Saturn in Aries governs the pneumogastric nerve
which feeds the heart, stomach, etc. Mars and Uranus
are in opposition to Neptune in the sign Cancer which
rules the stomach, and both are square to Saturn. We
may therefore conclude that there is a lack of nerve
force in the digestive organs, and unless Roberta is
taught to be careful in her food, digestive troubles are
sure to arise. We also find the Sun, which in the final
analysis is the giver of all life, placed in the sixth house,
which governs health, and though the Sun is not
afflicted in this horoscope, this sixth house position is
not a good sign; it depletes the vitality and makes
recovery from sickness more difficult. Therefore Ro-
berta's health ought to be cared for with special ten-
derness during the years of growth so that she may not
waste any of her life forces. Cold in the head signified
by Saturn in Aries, and catarrh of the stomach signified
by Mars opposition Neptune in Cancer, are the worst
tendencies, and they can, as said, be completely ob-
viated by using food as medicine. Study of menus such
as are found in our Department of Nutrition will give
you the proper food ideas of what to use and what
to avoid.
WINIFRED R. - Born November 13, 1912,
10:30 p.m., San Francisco.
In this horoscope we find a mixture of fixed and
cardinal signs on the angles. Mercury, one of the


38 YOUR HOROSCOPE
significators of mind, is in Sagittarius in conjunction
to Jupiter, and the Moon is in the saturnine sign Cap-
ricorn sextile to Mars. This shows us at once that we
have here an active nature bubbling over with physical
and mental vitality. The fifth house is especially well
fortified. Jupiter is there, strong in his own home
sign Sagittarius and in conjunction with Venus and
Mercury. Mercury in the fiery signs always gives a
sharp wit. They grasp an idea almost before it is
presented to them, and as the fifth house deals with
publication, dramatic art, and pleasures in general,
there is ample evidence that Winifred will have a
successful life if she takes up a vocation which is con-
nected with dramatic art or the stage or publishing.
But there is also another way open to her, for her
Sun and Mars are in conjunction in Scorpio. Both
of them are well fortified by a sextile to the Moon and
a trine to Neptune. Scorpio is the great healing sign,
and it is certain that Winifred will make a splendid
doctor or chemist. Furthermore, as the fifth house
position we mentioned above denotes a general success
in life, so the positions of Mars and the Sun in the
fourth house strengthen this indication and signify in
addition that the latter part of life will be very success-
ful. The Sun conjunction Mars in Scorpio gives Wini-
fred an indomitable courage. She will be able to hold
her own no matter under what circumstances of life
she may find herself, and Venus conjunction Jupiter
in the fifth house shows that she will be very fond of
pleasure and what is called a good time. At the same


YOUR HOROSCOPE 39
time, however, these planets signify that she has a noble
nature and would scorn to do anything she might be
ashamed of, so that despite her extreme fondness for
pleasure, her character will always remain chaste and
pure. The Sun and Mars trine to Neptune gives her a
fondness for travel, particularly long voyages, and as
Mars and the Sun give her an open, generous, nature
she will meet friends and get both pleasure and profit
from these travels.
With respect to marriage, though, things do not
look so auspicious for Winifred. The favorable fifth
house position of Venus conjunction Jupiter and Mer-
cury, shows that the period of courtship will be an
extremely happy period in her life. However, the Sun,
which is the significator of the marriage partner, is in
conjunction with Mars in the martial sign Scorpio.
This shows that Winifred herself has a temper of the
very fieriest sort when she is aroused, and it also
shows that the husband will have the same faults.
Moreover, Uranus, a planet which is extremely adverse
to restraint, is on the cusp of the seventh house, de-
noting marriage. We cannot get away from the fact
that in marriage it is necessary to bear and forbear or
there will be unhappiness. This will be extremely
difficult for Winifred, and consequently her sorrow in
life will come through marriage. Above all things
strive to teach her control of temper, for as Mars and
the Sun are in the fourth house, she will show this
side of her character only in the home, but that is
where it will do her the greatest hurt.


40 YOUR HOROSCOPE
From the indications it would be far better for
Winifred if she did not marry, but it is very doubtful
if you could make her see how it would result, espe-
cially as the period of courtship indicated by the favor-
able fifth house position will be as wonderful as an
artist's dream. There is a way out which we advocate
in all such cases. Get the two parties concerned into
as close association as possible without having the
marriage tie. Let them be in each others' company
from morning till night for a long period, then the
undesirable characteristics or the incompatible traits
in each nature will probably become manifest and they
will part, each rejoicing that they were not bound for
life. At that period do not be afraid to let Winifred
have perfect freedom. Her innate character is as
chaste and pure as a new blown peach blossom; she
will not bring disgrace upon herself, and taking this
course may save her many years of unhappiness.
With respect to health, we find that Saturn is in
Gemini, the sign which governs the arms, shoulders,
and lungs. He is unaspected, though, and will there-
fore have little power to hurt. On the other hand,
we find the Sun, the lifegiver, in conjunction to Mars,
the planet of dynamic energy, and sextile to the Moon,
which is the principal significator of health for a woman.
Therefore Winifred will enjoy the most radiant general
health, and if overtaken by sickness, she will recuperate
so rapidly that it will be a surprise to all.
Neptune in Cancer, the sign ruling the stomach,
in opposition to the Moon, makes her too fond of good


YOUR HOROSCOPE 41
food. You need not fear she will become dyspeptic,
however. The Sun and Mars will burn any poison
which may accumulate out in a fever, which will
leave her healthier than before, but you should teach
her not to drink with her meals.
HAYDEN H. — Born June 12, 1907, 6:35 p.m.
Brooklyn, New York.
This is what people usually call a very unlucky horo-
scope. Four common signs are on the angles and
Uranus and Saturn are opposing all the planets in
Cancer. Saturn is square the Sun, and we find just
one good aspect, viz.: Saturn sextile Venus. But as
we have often said, the horoscope only shows tenden-
cies, it cannot compel obedience.
If you take balls of equal size and group them
around one, you will find that twelve balls will com-
pletely hide a thirteenth, which will be unseen; never-
theless, it is there, as a central sphere which the other
twelve cover. So there is a thirteenth factor, an un-
seen mystic star which is much more important than
all the twelve signs of the zodiac and the planets in the
makeup of human destiny. That unseen factor is the
human will. Whenever we summon sufficient force,
all other agencies must give way, and the horoscope
is valuable beyond words in that it shows where the
opposing forces are within ourselves. We can then con-
centrate our efforts on those particular places and make


42 YOUR HOROSCOPE
them impregnable strongholds of virtue, invulnerable
to the onslaughts of temptation and vice.
This is the line that Hayden must learn to pursue,
to conquer his stars, and there is one great point in his
favor, i.e., the angles are all occupied by common
signs. Where fixed signs are on all the angles, the
Spirit has an indomitable will, courage, and persistence
which never recognize defeat; but the fate foreshown
by the planets in that case seems to be equally fixed
and stubborn. It is almost as when "Greek meets
Greek."
When common signs are on the angles, the influence
is more mutable and easy to modify, but unfortunately
an Ego entering existence in our earthly sphere under
such conditions is also of a vacillating nature or he
could not come to birth under the common sign vibra-
tion. This lack of stamina under the stern conditions
of life renders these people liable to the jolts and jars
signified by the bad aspects of planets. These afflictions
are indeed sent them for the purpose of rousing them
from their lethargy and causing them to do and dare.
This, then, is what the parents must do for this
child: they must teach him self-reliance, first, last,
and all the time. Start right now to make him do for
himself. Let him learn to take care of his own person,
to dress, wash, comb his hair, to get up and down from
chairs without help. Teach him to serve you, and
foster his will and belief in himself every day of his
life. You still have three of those precious first seven
years to instill the habit of helpfulness in him.


YOUR HOROSCOPE 43

He is a child who will need an unusual amount of
patience and forbearance, for he will be exceedingly
sensitive, and his imagination will run riot on account
of the conjunction of Moon, Mercury, Neptune, and
Jupiter in the psychic sign Cancer. If you did not
know astrology you would probably soon come to the
conclusion that he is a born prevaricator, but with this
key of compassion you must realize that children fresh
from the heaven world where fairies are facts cannot
for many years adjust themselves to our physical views.
Their imagination made things in heaven, and thus
they were true. Here it is the reverse; here things are
true, and our thoughts must conform to them. Do not
blame him for lying, but have patience and teach him
the standards of the world. Uranus and Mars in
Capricorn predispose to a grave breach with parents,
so be gentle or you may have yourselves to blame if
he leaves home early and fulfills an evil destiny. It
will be very difficult for him to subordinate himself
and bear the strain. This we all have to learn, and
he especially, but it can be taught now by kindness.
Having Mercury and the Moon, significators of the
mind, in the psychic, watery sign Cancer, Hayden will be
easily led and do almost anything for kindness and
approbation. Encourage him to work for praise and
reward, that will help. These configurations also give
him considerable talent for imitating and acting, as well
as make him very sensitive to his surroundings. The
saturnine sign Capricorn is on the cusp of the second
house, which rules finances, and the Venus signs,


44 YOUR HOROSCOPE
Taurus and Libra, are on the sixth and eleventh houses,
ruling service and friends. Saturn is sextile to Venus,
therefore the financial success of Hayden will come
through people older than himself. He will like them,
gain their friendship, and through them he will be
advanced in position and prosperity. Mars and Uranus
in the second give a strong tendency to squander his
resources in the things signified by the afflicted planets
Jupiter, Moon, and Neptune in Cancer. This also gives
liability to loss through corporation bubbles and garn-
bling. He should be taught to shun speculation and
gambling. Cards for pleasure have led many a man
to the poorhouse from necessity.
Saturn square the Sun and Mars opposition the
Moon and Jupiter are signs of poor vitality. Teach
him to keep his feet warm and eat very sparingly.
FLORENCE W. - Born March 1, 1908, Tulare,
California.
Here we have a little lady. The Moon sextile Venus
is a good aspect for general success during life, and it
will give Florence the tendency to be very neat, clean,
and tidy. She will always appear the lady to her very
finger tips. We also find four common signs on the
angles, and Saturn is unaspected. Thus there is fore-
shown a sheltered environment without very many
troubles in life. From the ordinary standpoint this
would be considered a very lucky horoscope, but we


YOUR HOROSCOPE 45
differ with this view of the matter. It is Saturn
which brings the trials and troubles, and the fixed and
cardinal signs give purpose and action. These are all
factors which make for soul growth, while the smoother
course foreshadown by common signs on the angles and
Saturn unaspectcd, cannot give a rich harvest in
heauenly treasure.
Florence will have the tendency to take things easy
and pick out the smoothest course in life where she
may auoid troubles and trials. She will usually giue up
anything which calls for exertion except at one time in
her life, and that will be during courtship. Venus is
in the fifth house, which has rule ouer this event and
ouer pleasures in general. It is, as already said, aspected
by a sextile to the Moon, and if this were all, the period
of courtship would run as smoothly and beautifully as
the rest of Florence's life. Uranus, however, the planet
which governs the unexpected things in life, is square,
showing riualry and an intense jealousy on the part of
Florence. At that time you will find one aspect coming
to the front which is not usually seen in her, that is
Mars in Taurus square Jupiter. Taurus governs the
tongue and uoice. Mars in Taurus always giues people
a sharp tongue, and the square to Jupiter may cause
her to lose her head entirely.
To help this child you should make her do euery-
thing for herself and serue you in addition. The first
part will not be difficult, for probably you will uery
soon notice that no one can fix her up nice enough
to suit her taste but herself. The latter part will most


46
YOUR HOROSCOPE
likely be more difficult, for she will not care to exert
herself on behalf of others. Whatever is learned in
childhood, however, usually sticks later, so be sure that
you teach her the habit of helpfulness.
The fifth house has to do with gambling. Venus
there squared by Uranus, and Mars there squared by
Jupiter, will make her very rash to risk her money on
all sorts of foolish schemes. This may resolve itself
into a mania for bridge and kindred forms of refined
gambling, but whatever she does in that respect will
always bring loss to her. On that account her
financial fortunes will be very uncertain, to say the least,
if this tendency is followed out. Do not let her take
part in any games where there is an element of chance,
and so far as is possible teach her that there are better
ways of spending one's time. If you are in the habit
of playing cards for pleasure yourselves, forego that
pastime for the sake of your child, for the seeds sown
at present are bound to bear fruit sometime in life.
Whatever she sees you do now, she will find some way
of imitating.
Regarding the health we find that Saturn is in
Pisces, the sign governing the feet, and this position
therefore denotes a tendency to cold feet. Mars in
Taurus, which governs the throat, gives a tendency to
sore throat, probably related to the cold shown by
Saturn. It will therefore be necessary to keep Florence's
feet warm, and this will probably obviate the tendency
to cold in the throat. We would not advise too much
clothing around the neck, though, rather the reverse.


YOUR HOROSCOPE 47

It is better to harden her so that she will not be so
apt to take cold in the throat. Should a swelling in the
tonsils develop, be sure that you do not have them
removed, as so many people do nowadays, for after
she passes the period of adolescence they will not trouble
her.

ROSALIND W. — Born September 12, 1901,
6:15 p.m., Kansas City, Mo.

When the planets in a horoscope are grouped about
the ASC and the first house, the person then born must
always work out his own salvation in this world with
very little, if any, aid from others. On the other hand
when the planets are grouped about the seventh house
and the Descendant we find that success in life comes
through the help of others. Applying this principle
to Rosalind's horoscope we see at once that her prin-
cipal success in life will come through marriage, for
the Sun and Moon are very close to the seventh cusp,
and Venus and Mercury are in the seventh house.
However, when we say success, we do not mean in
a financial sense. Rosalind will always have the where-
withal to live well. People with the Sun and Moon in
conjunction are never permanently poor and needy,
though they may at times feel a stringency, but Mars
in the eighth house, which denotes the finances of the
husband, is never good for the acquisition of wealth.
They will have plenty of money, but as the saying is,


48 YOUR HOROSCOPE
"As fast as it comes in through the door it goes out
through the window;" this, notwithstanding the fact
that Mars is sextile to Jupiter and Saturn.
This shows that the success mentioned is in the
direction of power and influence, and Rosalind will
have as much share in making this success as her
prospective husband, for they will both be writers and
speakers along original and unusual lines. This is
shown by Mercury, the planet of writing and speech, in
Libra, which is a sign of voice and expression, and
sextile to Uranus, the planet of intuition and inspiration,
in the mental ninth house, which is occupied by the
mental sign Sagittarius. In all probability her work
will be along occult lines. This judgment is further
strengthened by the fact that Neptune is in the psychic
sign Cancer.
Rosalind's life will not be a bed of roses, however.
Her work will bring considerable criticism and trouble
into her life, for Mercury in Libra and the seventh
house, which gives her voice and expression before the
public, is square to Neptune in the fourth sign, which
rules the home, and to Jupiter in the tenth sign and
house, denoting social standing. Rosalind has a mind
of her own; she will not be dictated to, and this brings
us to the point where we have to deal with her faults
so that we may help her to overcome and make her
life less burdensome than otherwise. Unfortunately,
this horoscope is being cast rather late in her life. Had
we had this opportunity of helping her ten years earlier,
it would have been much easier to obtain results, for


YOUR HOROSCOPE 49
the traits of which we have to speak will already be
manifested, though not settled, we hope.
The square of Mercury to Jupiter makes her quar-
relsone, argumentative in the very highest degree, and
the square of Mercury to Saturn will make her hold
spite and aim to get even. It is not denied that she
may often have cause for anger at the people who will
slander her and seek to undermine her character and
position, but no one ever gained anything by being
wrought up over criticism, and it hurts one very much
to brood over wrongs. If you can teach her that it is
the lot of everyone who does not follow the beaten
path in thought or action to be slandered and traduced,
even as Christ was, and that criticisms are compliments,
provided they are unjust, also that it is harmful to
mind what people say about one, then you may help
her to overcome. Show her also that to brood over
real or fancied wrongs is bad for the health of soul and
body. Time spent in that way can be much more
profitably expended in strengthening good resolutions to
succeed in spite of everything that others may do.
With respect to health, Rosalind should be very
careful with her food. The tendency is to indulge.
Neptune is in Cancer, the sign of the stomach, and
Jupiter and Saturn are in the opposing sign. All of
them are squared by Mercury in the sign Libra, ruling
the kidneys. This shows that unless she is taught to
eat sparingly and with discrimination, dyspepsia will
be deyelpped and make her life a misery. Mars in
Scorpio, the sign of the generative organs, indicates a


50 YOUR HOROSCOPE
slight trouble with the menstrual flow. The more she
walks, the better it will be for her, for this will regulate
the circulation, help the digestion, and promote the
general health. The Sun and Moon are in conjunction,
and that is a favorable aspect and does a great deal to
strengthen the constitution.
There is one talent which we forgot to speak about:
that is music. Venus and Mercury in the sign Libra
gives ability and appreciation in that direction, which
ought to be cultivated.

MIRIAM S. Born December 15, 1904, 7 a.m.,
Naples, Italy.

Sagittarius, a common, mutable sign, was rising at
the time Miriam was born, but her disposition is far
from easy going and mutable. She has a mind of her
own and will insist upon doing her own thinking and
having complete liberty of action. She will be very
resentful of restraint and will fight for her independence
to the last breath, for Uranus, the planet of independ-
ence and originality, is in the first house, weakly con-
joined with the Sun. This tendency is both good and
bad. If there were no people like Miriam the world
would get into a rut and stay there without a chance
of progress along any of the lines which we call civiliza-
tion. On the other hand, of course, it is a notable fact
that those who have dared to think differently from
their compeers have always had a life full of trouble.


YOUR HOROSCOPE 51
Mars, the planet of dynamic energy, is in Libra, the
sign of the voice, in the tenth house, which denotes
honor and social standing. It is square to Mercury,
the planet governing speech, and this is further testi-
mony that Miriam will be extremely impulsive in her
expression. It gives her a quick temper, and a very
sarcastic, argumentative nature. She will have a won-
derful capacity for learning; knowledge will come to
her almost without effort, and she will always, on that
account, have a fund of arguments wherewith to back
up her position. But the enemies of liberty and progress
always hate those who are able to hold their own -
all the more on that account. Therefore, Miriam is
likely to attract attacks and she will probably become
a storm center in some religious, social, or scientific
controversy. It is probable that her enemies will seek
to create a scandal, but they will never succeed in
besmirching her name, for the Sun is in the first house,
trine to Jupiter in the fourth, making her very sincere,
kind, generous, and popular. Venus in Aquarius,
sextile to the Moon, will give her hosts of friends who
will always stand by her, and Saturn sextile to the Sun
and trine to Mars will give her a certain tact and
diplomacy which will assure the friendship, favor, and
co-operation of people in high social and governmental
positions.
Furthermore, Mars, the planet of dynamic energy,
trine to Saturn, the planet of persistence, gives her
the true temperament of the pioneer. No matter what
obstacles she may meet in the world, she will never


52 YOUR HOROSCOPE
become discouraged; she will continue to dare and do
whatever she thinks is right in spite of all the odds
against her. She will attempt the seemingly impossible,
and by the sheer force of her determination she will
probably carry her undertakings to a successful con-
clusion.
Mars is square to the Sun and in opposition to
Jupiter, the planet of benevolence. This will make
Miriam very foolish in her desire to do other people
a favor, and some of the greatest disappointments in
her life will probably come from a realization of how
little the people to whom she has been kind appreciate
her. Mercury in Capricorn, and Mars trine Saturn,
make her diplomatic and economical in other respects,
but when it is a question of helping someone else in
distress she is likely to throw all caution to the winds
and give indiscriminately. If you can help her to curb
that tendency and inculcate some measure of caution
in speech, it will be a great help to her in life, and she
will probably make fewer enemies.
The abrupt, sarcastic, and overbearing attitude fos-
tered by Moon square Uranus, and the sudden likes
and dislikes which she takes to people, are about the
worst dangers to her happiness. Try to bring out the
tact and diplomacy signified by Mars trine Saturn.
While Miriam is apt to make strong enemies, she is
also sure to make a host of friends, as shown by the
sextile of the Moon and Venus, the Sun's sextile to
Saturn and trine to Jupiter. These aspects will also
bring her abundant finances, and though it is likely


YOUR HOROSCOPE 53
that she will spend them lavishly and sometimes foolishly,
she is sure always to have the wherewithal to gratify
her desires. Part of this will probably come through
inheritance.
Saturn, Venus, and Mars are in Libra and Aquarius,
signs of voice, and they are well aspected. This will
give Miriam an unusual gift of expression. She will
be very deliberate and impressive in her speech, so that
whatever she says is bound to carry conviction. Venus
in Aquarius, the eleventh sign, governing friends, hopes,
and wishes, is sextile to the Moon, and this, with the
Sun's trine to Jupiter, shows that on the whole Miriam's
life will be successful and that a great many of her
hopes, wishes, and ambitions will be realized.
The Moon square to Uranus and the Sun in
Sagittarius, a sign that has to do with travel, shows that
there is some danger of accidents by electricity in con-
nection with travel, but the trine of the Sun and Jupiter
forms a means of protection so that she may-experience
a number of hairbreadth escapes.
Mars square Mercury shows danger of a nervous
breakdown from overwork, and as Mars is in Libra,
the sign ruling the kidneys, we may conclude that these
are one of the weak points of the body.
It will not be necessary for Miriam to study very
hard in order to learn her lessons, so be sure that you
do not attempt to overtax her, or allow her to overtax
herself, for she will be the one to do the driving.
The square of the Sun and Moon shows some
parental disagreements which will adversely affect


54 YOUR HOROSCOPE
Miriam. The Moon in the twelfth house sign Pisces
gives the mother a tendency to coop her up and limit
her more than is good for the child. It also interferes
with the circulation and general health. She ought to
take all the exercise possible, for there is a tendency to
sluggishness in the lower limbs, and also to digestive
trouble. Allow her plenty of exercise but not too
much, nor too rich food; then she will grow up to be
a strong and robust woman.

MARGARET L. - Born Dec. 26, 1903, 6 p.m.,
Arizona.

At the time of Margaret's birth, four cardinal signs
were on the angles, showing that the life will be one of
activity. The first and most powerful configuration
which one notes is formed between the Moon, Neptune,
and the Sun. The Moon is a significator of the mind;
it is in Aries, the sign of the head, and square to the
Sun and Neptune, the latter two being in opposition.
This indicates that Margaret is headstrong and im-
pulsive in her actions, likely to go off at a tangent,
contrary to conventions.
However, you must remember that the horoscope
shows only tendencies, and that one aspect in itself
is not sufficient to settle the matter in any direction;
although we find an erratic tendency from the aspects
named, there is good soil to work in for counteracting
it. Mercury, the other significator of mind, is also


YOUR HOROSCOPE 55
in a cardinal sign, Capricorn. It is sextile to Jupiter
and Venus, showing the other side of Margaret's nature.
She has excellent reasoning powers, and a kindly,
affectionate disposition. This is what you must use to
work upon in order to save her trouble and bring her
through youth in a safe and sane manner, for there
are grave dangers ahead of her in the earlier years of
her life.
Venus is in the sign Scorpio, which rules the gen-
erative organs, and it is trine to Jupiter in Pisces, the
twelfth house sign, denoting sorrow, trouble, and self-
undoing. Both of them are sextile to Mercury, the
planet of mind. This will make Margaret very attrac-
tive to the opposite sex; her personality will be ex-
tremely pleasing, and her manner of address will be
such that she will command attention and stand out
from the crowd wherever she goes. The fifth house
rules courtships, and Venus being there so well aspected
is a testimony that Margaret will have offers of mar-
riage at a very early age.
Saturn is conjoined to Mars in the seventh house,
though, and this conjunction occurs in a fixed sign,
which is a strong testimony that there will be no hap-
piness in marriage for her. Moreover, for a woman,
the Sun is the prime significator of marriage, and here
we find the Sun at Margaret's birth aspected by the
square of the Moon and opposed by Neptune. Those
are all indications against happiness in marriage, and
the signs of a happy courtship are so strong that Mar-
garet will hardly escape a youthful indiscretion which


56 YOUR HOROSCOPE
may mar her whole life unless you are alert and guard
her during the critical period. When she is between
fourteen and fifteen years of age the Sun will have
progressed to the sextile of Venus and Jupiter; at the
same time the Moon will have reached the opposition
of its own place in the fourth house which signifies the
home. From that position it will square the Sun and
Neptune, showing that there is a breaking away from
the home, and unless this is prevented it will surely
wreck her whole life.
There still remain a couple of years before she comes
to that critical period, and we would advise you, as
parents, to cultivate an attitude of extreme kindness
toward her. Be sure that you make your home so
attractive that she will not be able to find any place
like it. See that you make her like it so well that when
she goes to any other place she will say with her whole
heart and soul, "I wish I were at home, there is no
place like it." Try to gain her confidence in every
particular, and see if you cannot bring her a knowledge
of the dangers that lie before her without seeming to
preach. She has, as said, a good mind; the Moon is
sextile to Saturn which gives her a deep insight into
things. Mercury is well aspected so there is a good
foundation to work upon, and it is your duty to do
your utmost for her. We pray earnestly that you may
be guided aright so that you may save her from much
trouble, sorrow, and grief which will otherwise result.
Venus in Scorpio, which rules the pelvic region,
trine to Jupiter in Pisces, the sign of the feet, shows


YOUR HOROSCOPE 57
that there is a graceful control of the limbs, and the
seventh house which governs the public, so well forti-
fied, shows that Margaret will succeed in a career hav-
ing to do with dancing and the dramatic art. In view
of the tendencies spoken of in the foregoing, however,
it were perhaps better not to encourage her too much
in this line of work until the critical period mentioned
has been passed. It will be best to keep her, as much
as possible, under the protective influence of home
until the 18th year; then the Sun will be in conjunction
with Mercury and she will develop a different, and
much more rational, turn of mind.

Regarding her health, we find Neptune in Cancer,
the sign of the stomach, in the twelfth house, and
opposition to the Sun in the sixth; both are squared by
the Moon. This shows digestive trouble. There is a
fondness for good food indicated by the trine of Venus
and Jupiter, but the digestion is not sufficiently strong
to take care of the maximum quantity desired by the
palate. It is rather late to begin to teach her to be
frugal. Had we had the privilege of casting this horo-
scope ten years earlier you would have had a much
better chance to do something for Margaret. As it is,
you can only do your very best and then leave every-
thing else to work itself out according to what has gone
before. We trust that you may succeed in helping her,
at any rate during the critical period which lies a few
years in front of her.


58 YOUR HOROSCOPE
ERMAN C. - Born Jan. 25, 1912, 3 a.m., Ogden,
Iowa.
At the time of Erman's birth, the sign of aspiration,
Sagittarius, was rising, with Jupiter, the planet of be-
nevolence and idealism, strongly fortified by position,
sign, and aspects. This will give Erman an ultra-
idealistic nature and cause him to be liked by all who
meet him. He has a bright mind, for Jupiter is sextile
to the Sun, and his trine to the Moon and Saturn adds
depth and ability to concentrate.
Erman will be able to see through and untangle
"knotty" problems, for where Saturn, the planet of
obstruction, is configured with Mercury and the Moon,
which are swift and flighty as the mind they rule, he
always acts as a brake, furthering concentration. Un-
fortunately, Mercury is aspecting Saturn by square,
and that will give a tendency to gloom under unfavor-
able transits; it will also impel him to equivocate or
prevaricate when he thinks he may lose the good opinion
of people by telling the truth. This you see from the
position of Mercury in the tenth house sign Capricorn,
involving honor and reputation. This is Erman's most
vulnerable point, and you should teach him that repu-
tation is only what people think about us, it has no real
value; but character, which is what we are, is the
determinator of our real worth. We may deceive
others when we misrepresent facts, but we cannot blind
ourselves, and some day there comes a reckoning. Then


YOUR HOROSCOPE 59
reputation crumbles unless it is backed by character.
It will probably be difficult for Erman to adhere
strictly to the truth, because Uranus, the planet of
imagination, is conjoined with the Sun on the cusp
of Aquarius, the sign of wishes and fancies, trine to
Mars in Taurus, the sign of the voice. Be charitable,
there is no meanness in him. It is just that his tongue
and imagination are apt to run away with his reason.
He will never say anything to hurt anyone, but he sees
things in a different, idealistic light; he speaks of them
as he wishes they were, and as they ought to be if ideals
were realities; and even if his impulsive iteration of
stories of the stuff that dreams are made of bothers
you, you will like them for his sake. Nevertheless, try
to keep his feet on earth.
Jupiter trine Moon and Saturn and Sun conjunct
Uranus in Aquarius, trine Mars in Taurus, also shows
considerable inventive ability. Erman will dream of
things that will aid the world's work. His inventions will
have commercial value, for the second house, which rules
finance shows that he will obtain a competence in life.
Uranus, the planet which brings sudden and unexpected
things to pass, shows that Erman's financial success will
come to him overnight. Be sure that you give free
scope to his desire for "making something," and "fixing
things." Encourage him to work out his problems, and
to be active, for with four common signs on the angles,
he will be prone to dream rather than work, and then
his inventions would come to naught.
With respect to health we find that Erman has


60 YOUR HOROSCOPE
Saturn in Aries, conjunction the Moon. This is an
indication that he will be subject to severe and chronic
headaches, and the square of these planets to Mercury
in Capricorn shows that indigestion will be at the
bottom of the trouble, for Mercury rules the nerves,
and operates in the sign opposite to that wherein he
is placed, namely, Cancer, the sign ruling the stomach.
In addition, we have the opposition of Neptune to
Uranus, from Cancer and Capricorn, which also inter-
feres with the digestive function. The conjunction of
Uranus and Sun on the cusp of Aquarius, gives a tend-
ency to irregular heart action, which is ruled by the
sign opposite Aquarius, namely, Leo. Teach Eman
frugality, and care in matters of diet. There is no
disease more distressing than dyspepsia, for it robs life
of all joy and incentive. However, care, right habits
inculcated during the first seven years while his vital
body is in the course of gestation, will probably save
him a lifetime of trouble.

Be sure that you teach him by example. It is no
good to preach, for he hasn't the mind to understand,
but he will want to imitate what you do. You are
his ideals, and his patterns; therefore, you have a great
privilege in moulding the habits of this child. You
have also a grave responsibility, as your brother's keeper;
may you keep your trust so that you deserve the "well
done" approval when your labor is finished.


YOUR HOROSCOPE 61
JAMES P. S. — Born Oct. 25, 1914, 7:27 a.m.,
Washington, D. C.

Here we have a youngster with will, vim, and a
vigorous determination to do and dare. That is evident
at first glance, for there are four fixed signs on the
angles: the belligerent, martial sign Scorpio on the
ASC, with its ruler, Mars, 4 degrees below the cusp;
Mercury is conjunction Mars and sextile the Moon,
and the Sun is trine Saturn. Therefore James will
have a bright mind and untiring energy. Naturally,
that is going to make him a difficult child to raise,
and you may often feel as if you were at your wits end
when he gets into mischief on every hand; but be
patient and rejoice, only wishy-washy boys are easy
to bring up. The real workers of the world, who have
unbounded dynamic energy for constructive work and
the will and determination necessary to achieve, are
generally thought to be destructive and stubborn in
childhood. You have a jewel in James, and some day
he will make his mark. You will notice that the Sun
is one degree of Scorpio, and the ASC is 14. The
first 13 years may, therefore, be marked with difficulties
in the home, which retard the proper development, but
then the progressed Sun reaches the Ascendant, bringing
a change. From that time James will begin to grow
like a flower.

The direction in which his efforts will be most suc-
cessful is indicated by the Sun trine Saturn in Cancer,


62 YOUR HOROSCOPE
and Mars, the ruler, conjunction Mercury, in Scorpio,
sextile to the Moon in Capricorn.
Cancer and Scorpio are both watery signs, therefore
liquids will enter into the occupation. Cancer is the
fourth house sign, ruling lands, and Capricorn is also
an earthy sign. Saturn in Cancer signifies mines, and
Mars conjunction Mercury in Scorpio is an excellent
configuration for a chemist, assayer, or surgeon. Saturn
in the 7th, 8th, or 9th house also shows mechanical
ability. Therefore James will find scope for his talents
as an assayer, or mining and hydraulic engineer, and,
as the Sun is close to the ASC, he will undoubtedly
work himself up to a leading position in his profession.
The principal fault is found in Mars conjoined to
Mercury in Scorpio, and it is aggravated because of
the four fixed signs on the angles. Mars is a planet
of dynamic energy, which may be either good or bad,
according to the use made of it. Mercury governs the
speech, and the conjunction with Mars makes a sharp
tongue, no matter in what sign these planets are placed.
Some signs - Pisces, for instance - would tone this
tendency down, others accentuate it. Scorpio is the
worst in that respect, for it is the sign opposite Taurus
which governs the throat. Therefore James' tongue
can sting like a Scorpion, and there is a strong tendency
to cruelty and heartlessness. Do not let him become
a surgeon, or have anything to do with blood, if you
can prevent it. Take particular care to teach him
kindness to animals which are altogether defenceless.
He will be very "set" on account of the fixed signs on


YOUR HOROSCOPE 63

the angles, but you have seven years before you in
which to modify the undesirable traits by an example
of kindness and consideration which is sure to leave
its mark.
Saturn in Cancer threatens interference with health
by indigestion, for Cancer rules the stomach, and Saturn
is the planet of obstruction. Mars in Scorpio warns
of rectal trouble, for Scorpio rules the rectum and
Mars produces heat, eruptions, and loss of blood; hence
there is a tendency to bleeding piles. These conditions
of the stomach and rectum bring about constipation.
Teach James to eat sparingly; give him the plainest
food, not too many mixtures and dishes at a meal.
Use whole wheat flour entirely to scour the intestines,
and a suppository made of coca butter will have a
healing and cooling effect on the rectum, if trouble is
not entirely obviated by the use of proper food.

JOHN G. - Born November 10, 1911, 10:30 a.m.,
Schenectady, New York.

At the time of John's birth we find four cardinal
signs on the angles, with the majority of planets in
fixed or cardinal signs. This shows that his will be a
life of action and accomplishment. That is itself a
cause for congratulation, for whether a life be what we
usually call good or bad, so long as there is action the
life will be productive of soul growth, and the seeming
bad is turned to as good account as that which was


64 YOUR HOROSCOPE
regarded as best by us. Our Father in Heaven looks
at all things from an infinitely larger viewpoint. To
Him the roughest coating cannot hide the sparkling
diamond-soul, and He gives to each of us just the ex-
periences needed to wear away the coarse coating that
hides the gem.
The foregoing paragraph does not mean, however,
that a hard life and dreadful experiences are in store
for John. On the contrary, the augurs at his birth were
unusually splendid, and show that he has made what
we would call good use of his last life to have earned
such fine aspects. However, to us astrology is religion,
or at least a phase of religion, and we feel it a duty
as well as a privilege to preach that side of the science
in season or out. Nor do we make an apology for so
doing.
At John's birth Jupiter, the planet of benevolence,
was conjoined with Mercury, the planet of mind, and
the Sun, which is the lifegiver. These configurations
occur in or close to the eleventh house which rules
friends, hopes, and wishes. Is not that plain? Even
if there were no other aspects to this group, we see
at once that John will be of a happy, jovial, benevolent
disposition. Naturally, that attitude of mind will draw
to him hosts of people who will want favors and be
in positions to return the compliments, so that they will
help John to realize his hopes and wishes, which will
bring him honor, wealth, and fame.
As said, though, he is not getting this for nothing,
or by divine caprice; he has earned it somewhere, some-


YOUR HOROSCOPE 65

how, in the past and is now reaping the fruits he did
not garner then. Nor should it be forgotten that it is
his present attitude of continued kindness and help-
fulness that will preserve the friendships he will renew
in this life. Should he change, as he may, for he is
divine and has a certain amount of choice, then gradu-
ally his friends will leave him and in his next life he
will have a very different horoscope. This considera-
tion also applies in the reverse manner to others who
are not so fortunate as John. There is no reason to be
jealous or despondent, we all have a measure of free
will; we may all try to be kind, and if we do, we shall
also find friends who will help and comfort us as we
them. The immutable law of compensation works with
unerrng exactitude in all departments of life.
Venus, the planet of attraction, is also uncommonly
well aspected. We find it in the ninth house, which
governs the higher mind, and it is sextile to Mercury,
and trine to Mars in the mercurial sign Gemini. These
are also signs of a kindly, though energetic, disposition.
The sextile of Mercury to Uranus, and its trine to
Neptune, gives intuition, and spiritual sight will likely
be developed at some time in life. Saturn, the planet
of obstruction, is sextile to the Moon, which also in-
fluences the mind, and has the tendency to hold it
steady when that is required for concentration upon
some problem. It will also give him patience and
perseverance to work out whatever plans he may form.
Venus' ray makes artists, no matter to what branch
they devote themselves. Here Venus is in her own sign,


66 YOUR HOROSCOPE
Libra, a sign of voice, sextile to Mercury, the planet of
speech, and trine to Uranus, the planet of inspiration,
the latter in the first house. Thus we may judge that
John will be a highly inspirational musician and singer.
Mercury in Scorpio conjoined with Jupiter also
indicates success as a doctor or chemist.
But you want to find out about his faults, of course,
for he is not perfect, or he would not be here. The
best help you can give him is to aid him in correcting
the undesirable tendencies in his nature, so that they
may give him less trouble than if he is allowed to grow
up with them unchecked.
The first and most serious incipient fault is shown
by Venus, the planet of love, trine to its octave Uranus,
the planet of altruism. Now you would say, "Why!
that seems good - altruistic, all-embracing love!" So
it does, if we could only live up to it. The Venus-love
is essentially selfish; by it we love those who belong to
us: my husband, my wife, and my child; but Venus
gives us no affection for those not related to us by such
close ties. The Uranian ray will bear no restrictions,
it embraces all the world in a pure, unselfish love, an
ideal which is as yet unattainable to all but a few.
Therefore the aspect of Uranus to Venus gives trouble,
whether the aspect be good or bad. We feel drawn to
all by the universal uranian ray, but can give expression
only to the venusian love which aims to possess the
object. This leads to numerous illicit amours, which
inevitably bring trouble in their train. The Sun gives
life and vitality, but Saturn saps vitality. These two


YOUR HOROSCOPE 67
planets are in opposition from Taurus, which rules the
throat, and Scorpio, which rules the genitals. Be
careful to guard John against forming a secret habit,
and teach him the sanctity of the generative function,
also the dreadful consequences visited upon the trans-
gressors. Saturn in the sign of the throat shows that
this is a weak point in the system, anyway; if he takes
up the vocal art that will need special care, and any
abuse of the sex will react upon the larynx of one who
has Saturn in Taurus.
As the Moon is the significator of the marriage
partner of a man, we may judge that its placement in
the seventh house, which rules marriage, sextile Saturn,
the planet of obstruction, thrift, and economy, will
bring John a wife who will steady him and take care of
him in a practical way which we trust will save him
from the tendency shown. The Sun conjunction with
Jupiter gives splendid health and recuperative power,
but it is weakened by the opposition of Saturn, and
there is on that account a tendency to apoplexy in later
years. Teach him to be frugal in his diet.

MARION K. — Born Feb. 13, 1905, 3:30 a.m.,
Stockton, Kansas.
At Marion's birth we find the common sign Sagit-
tarius rising, with Capricorn intercepted in the first
house, and Uranus is there. The constellation Sagit-
tarius is pictured as the Centaur, half horse and half


68 YOUR HOROSCOPE
man. It always gives a restless nature, and a child born
under its influence feels an inner urge, an ambition
or aspiration, and as most of us are very undeveloped,
we think to find heartease by seeking without in the
wide world instead of looking within. So these people
roam from place to place, if not prevented by other
influences, as Marion is, for in her horoscope the satur-
nine sign Capricorn is intercepted, and in it is Uranus,
the planet of liberty and independence. Marion is a
difficult child, but were Uranus free in the rising sign
she would be absolutely ungovernable. However, the
influence of a planet in intercepted signs is compara-
tively latent until by progression it frees itself from the
sign which holds it in leash, and as the rate of progres-
sion for Uranus is very slow, Marion will never feel the
full effect of his goading influence in a life of normal
length. There is no question, however, that she will
always chafe at the slightest restraint; she will want
to get away to somewhere, and that is not a happy
condition. It will take much joy out of her life unless
you can appeal to her reason and show that content-
ment must come from within herself, not without. We
feel that you may reach her in that way, for the Moon,
a significator of mind, is in Gemini, a mercurial sign,
and trine to Mercury, the other significator of mind,
which is placed in the intellectual sign Aquarius. This
gives her a logical mind of high caliber and exceptional
reasoning powers. It is to be hoped that this con-
figuration will cause her to cultivate the philosophical
attitude, so that she may compose herself in comparative


YOUR HOROSCOPE 69
contentment by the realization that what cannot be
cured must be endured.
Marion will always prefer the company of older
people, because the Sun is in conjunction with Saturn,
and she will find among them influential friends who
will be of much benefit to her. Jupiter, the planet of
benevolence, is sextile to the Sun and Saturn, which
are located in Aquarius, the eleventh-house sign, which
also rules friendships. Saturn in the intellectual sign
Aquarius makes her a deep and profound thinker.
Mercury and the Moon, also in airy, intellectual signs,
give her a love for literature, science, music, and art,
with considerable ability as a linguist and an elocutionist.
She will be able to speak with great force and profun-
dity so that her words will carry the weight of authority
and impress her ideas upon the minds of her hearers.
She will be a power in any cause which she may
espouse, for she is very intense in whatever she under-
takes on account of Mars’ position in Scorpio, where
he is essentially dignified and will exert a strong in-
fluence, though he is not aspected. This influence is
augmented because he is the most elevated planet in
the horoscope.
Saturn in the second house is unfavorable for the
finances. People with that configuration usually have
a hard time all their lives. The Sun in the second house
is also unfavorable, for though it makes people capa-
ble of getting money, it also gives them the faculty of
getting rid of it with equal facility. However, when
the Sun and Saturn are there in conjunction, the result


70 YOUR HOROSCOPE
is good, for though the earning capacities of the Sun
are somewhat obstructed by Saturn, so are his spending
proclivities, and thus, people with that configuration
usually acquire a competence by thrift and careful in-
vestment. Marion has Jupiter, the planet of opulence,
sextile to Saturn and the Sun, so she will make for
herself a lucrative business in some line that has to do
with the fifth house, which rules educational endeavors,
public entertainments, and publications. The Moon
there, trine to Mercury in the second house, together
with the fact that the artistic sign Libra is on the
tenth house, which rules social standing, leads us to
believe that she will find her vocation in the publishing
business, writing and editing books or journals of artistic
and scientific nature.
Neptune in Cancer, the sign which rules the stomach,
square to Venus, shows a fickle stomach, and Mars
in Scorpio, which rules the rectum, tells you to beware
of bleeding piles. Teach Marion to be careful in her
diet and refrain from the use of condiments which
irritate the intestinal tract. Saturn in Aquarius, con-
joined with the Sun, finds reflex action in the opposite
sign, Leo, which rules the heart, resulting in a tendency
to heart trouble. This is no cause for alarm, however;
strong hearts are weakened by overstraining, and weak
hearts may be strengthened by care. If Marion is
taught to avoid violent exercise, she may never know
that she has a heart so far as being troubled by its
action is concerned.

NORMAN P. Born April 7, 1912, 9:05 a.m.,
Boston, Mass.
Here we have a youngster born under a lucky star,
for the Sun is in its exaltation sign Aries, trine to the
great benefic, Jupiter, which is essentially dignified in
its own sign, Sagittarius. This is a very strong com-
bination which makes for general success in life, and
shows that we have here a strong soul capable of
attaining and maintaining a place of vantage in the
world. Mercury, the ruler of the ASC, is posited in
the eleventh house, which denotes friends, hopes, and
wishes. So is the Sun, and taking the fact that Mer-
cury is well aspected by trine to the Moon and sextile
to Mars, the giver of enterprise and energy, together
with the trine of the Sun to Jupiter, we may well judge
that Norman will have good and influential friends who
will stand by him all through life and help him realize
his hopes and aspirations.
This all sounds very nice, and it may cause some
to feel jealous because they, or their children, have not
such a horoscope, but we must realize that there is
neither chance, caprice, or luck in this world. As
Mephisto says in "Faust":
"How closely 'luck' is linked to 'merit',
Does never to the fool occur,
Had he the wise man's stone, I swear it,
The stone had no philosopher."
We all are where we are by our own acts, if not in this
life, then in a previous existence. This must be realized


72 YOUR HOROSCOPE
by all students of astrology, for if we live only once,
then there is no justice in the world. The horoscope
of a poor person who has Saturn square the Moon at
birth, for instance, may show nothing but the most
unaccountable trials and setbacks all his life because
Saturn by transit moves at the same rate as the Moon
progresses, so Saturn keeps hunting the Moon, and
every time there is a good aspect of other planets that
might bring a little joy into the life, there comes Saturn
square Moon and frustrates it. If there is an evil
aspect, Saturn square Moon makes it still worse. That
does not give such a person a chance compared to
Norman, but if we hold the theory that both have lived
before, and that Norman was friendly and helpful to
whomever he contacted, while the other was selfish
and did all he could to obstruct others, then we can
realize the justice in the present birth when the latter is
placed under the whip of Saturn, the planet of obstruc-
tion, while Norman is being helped by Jupiter, the planet
of benevolence.
But it is also necessary to realize that Norman must
continue in this life to be friendly, in order to keep
the friends he has made, and the other poor person
will probably learn the value of friends by the lack.
He will then strive to make friends who will sympathize
with his sorrows. If he does, he may also ameliorate
his lot and gain peace, for as we say continually, God
and His ministers, the Seven Spirits before the Throne,
do not aim to punish or get even with anyone. These
Great Star Spirits only try to teach us the lessons we


YOUR HOROSCOPE 73
need to learn, in order to become nobler, better men
and women. They seek to bring out the divine spark
within ourselves, and the moment we turn from our
wrong actions and begin to do right, we will feel less
of the saturnine obstruction and more of the jupiterian
benevolence. The horoscope shows only tendencies;
we are the determinators as to whether we will drift
with the tide or stem the current. As Tennyson says:

“Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and lower the proud;
Turn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm and cloud;
Thy wheel we neither love nor hate.
Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;
With that wild wheel we go not up or down;
Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.
Smile, and we smile, the lords of many lands;
Frown, and we smile, the lords of our own hands;
For man is man, and master of his fate.”

Norman, then, has all chances, made by himself,
for a successful life, but he must exert himself to keep
it so, for Saturn is in the twelfth house, which shows
sorrow, trouble, and self-undoing, and although Saturn
is not afflicted, his position shows that underhanded
attempts of secret enemies will not be wanting to
frustrate his designs. The cause will probably come
from Mercury, the planet of speech. You may take it
that Mars in the mercurial signs Gemini and Virgo,
or Mercury in the martial signs Aries and Scorpio, or
Mercury and Mars in any configuration, have a tend-
ency to make the person quick, blunt, abrupt, and


74 YOUR HOROSCOPE
emphatic in speech, while if Mercury is in the satur-
nine signs Capricorn and Aquarius, or Saturn is in the
mercurial signs Gemini and Virgo, or Saturn and Mer-
cury are configurated, it gives the person caution, tact,
and diplomacy in speech.

It may be set down also as a general rule that the
Mars-Mercury person is open and above board; what
he is, he is to your face. He cannot stand before you
with a smile on his face and a knife ready to use when
you have turned your back; therefore he often incurs
the hatred and enmity of people who then seek to
undermine his position, honor, and integrity. This the
Saturn-Mercury person escapes by tact, but personally
we do not admire the method, although we see certain
reasons for its moderate use.

Norman has Mars configurated with Mercury by
sextile, and Mercury is in Aries, a martial sign, so you
see that he is anything but two-faced. He will have
great difficulty in hiding his feelings from people;
therefore, the people he dislikes will hate him and
endeavor to harm him. This will bring him much
unhappiness, and you may save him a lot of trouble
if you can teach him to hide his feelings and simply
keep away as much as possible from people who do not
appeal to him. He does not need to become a hypo-
crite, but it is not necessary to tell people unpleasant
things.

From the way we have spoken it might be inferred
that Norman has only "good" aspects, and that that
would make the life barren of soul growth, which comes


YOUR HOROSCOPE 75

from the trials of life supplied under the influence of
squares and oppositions, but we rejoice that this is not
so. There are several squares which will bring out
his mettle.
Uranus is the planet of idealism, and it is placed
in its own sign, the intellectual Aquarius, in the ninth
house, which governs the higher mind, and it is square
to Mercury, the planet of reason. That gives us the
key and the combination to Norman's mind. He is
an idealist, a reformer, and very radical in his ideas.
Without such people there would be no progress; the
world would simply stand still, for oh! how it dislikes
to move! The old rut is so good and easy to travel,
but it hurts to make the effort to get into anything new.
Can you see Saturn there in the twelfth house, rep-
resenting the conservatives who fight the reformer to
the finish? But Norman will best them, having the
help of many friends represented by Sun trine Jupiter.
He has occult powers nearly developed, but a
negative mediumistic character, for Neptune is in the
psychic sign Cancer, square the Sun. The Moon is
square Venus in the twelfth house sign Pisces, and
Mercury is square Uranus, the planet of intuition, in
the ninth house of vision and dreams. Be careful that
he is taught to be positive, and keep him away from
mediumistic people or he may become influenced.
See that his throat is hardened against cold, for
Saturn is in Taurus, which rules that part of the body,
and that makes him sensitive. Otherwise he will be
very healthy.

MARGERY W. — Born May 31, 1907, 9:45 p.m.,
New York City.
Here is a combination for you: Uranus and Mars
rising in the saturnine sign Capricorn. Margery is
original to the finger tips, and she is not going to do
things the way anybody else wants; she has a better
way of her own, and she knows it. This may be very
trying to her parents and her associates, but her way
will be a good way in most cases, so it will be well to
let her follow her own inclination. Venus, the planet
of love, sextile to Jupiter, the planet of benevolence,
makes her exceedingly kind and sympathetic. Some-
times the Mars-Uranus combination in opposition to
Jupiter and Neptune may lead her into rash, impulsive
acts of charity, and may cause her financial loss, but
in the long run she will be the gainer in experience
and golden treasure in heaven, and that is worth a
whole lot more than the dross you have to leave behind
when you shuffle off the mortal coil. She will never
be a Hetty Green, for Saturn is in the second house
and he always obstructs, but she will
always have abundant means to satisfy her needs, for
the luminaries, the Sun and Moon, are in trine, and
Venus, the planet of attraction, is sextile to Jupiter,
the planet of opulence. These aspects give her the
money, and the last named also gives her the taste for
spending it by fostering a love of the beautiful in dress
and surroundings.


YOUR HOROSCOPE 77

And where will her money come from? From her
own efforts and ability, as shown by the planets in the
first house, which gives her an unusual originality. This
she will use in an educational work, as shown by the
presence of the Sun and Mercury in the fifth house,
trine to the Moon in the first. The first house signifies
her own personal self in the most intimate sense, and
the Moon is the planet of fecundation; as it moves
around the zodiac it fructifies everything in all depart-
ments of life as denoted by the houses, and makes the
opportunities grow and flower. It is trine to the Sun,
which stands for those in authority: employers, or heads
of business enterprises; also to Mercury, which is the
planet of mind, speech, and writing. This configura-
tion of the Sun, Moon, and Mercury occurs from
Aquarius and Gemini, two intellectual, scientific signs.
Gemini, where the Sun and Mercury are, is in the
fifth house in this horoscope. The fifth house deals
with public places of pleasure and amusement, also
with literary publications and educational institutions.
The nature of the configuration of the planets we are
considering excludes the possibility of Margery's being
connected with anything of a frivolous nature, and
points to the educational aspect of the fifth house as
her sphere of work. She will originate and carry to a
successful accomplishment an educational work of some
magnitude despite all opposition, notwithstanding that
she will be stigmatized as a fool and a freak, as shown
by the opposition of Uranus to Jupiter and Neptune
in the seventh house, which denotes the public. She


78 YOUR HOROSCOPE

will also have a hard time getting a start, for though
Saturn is intercepted and cannot therefore make his
obstructive influence fully felt in the second house,
which governs finances, and although he is unaspected,
there is always a cold hand over the department of life
indicated by the house he is in. As said, though, the
other influences for financial support are too strong
to be more than temporarily checked by Saturn.
We have said that the disposition of Margery is
basically kind, loving, and affectionate, as shown by
Venus in her home sign Taurus, sextile to Jupiter in
his exaltation sign, Cancer. At times, however, the
impulsiveness and irritability of Uranus and Mars in
Capricorn may change her entirely for the time being.
There is a temper and difficulty in getting over it, a
tendency to hold spite, which should be dealt with
in the early years. Would that we had had the chance
to cast this horoscope at birth, and instruct you re-
garding this trait of character, for it is already well
settled. However, you still have a chance to work on
her to eradicate it, and if you can, it will save her
many an hour of brooding over what she has said and
done in one of those moods. It is so difficult for a
character like this to admit being in the wrong and to
make up, so the best way is to avoid being irritable and
impulsive. Self-control is learned in the earlier years
of life to an extent not apprehended by educators, and
if taught then saves much sorrow in later life. Be sure
to see that if she has had a quarrel with anyone, she
makes up as soon as possible, and that she must forgive


YOUR HOROSCOPE 79

and forget with her whole heart.
Jupiter, the planet of opulence, benevolence, and
munificence, in Cancer, the sign which rules the
stomach, makes the person generous to himself where
food is concerned. In other words, there is a strong
tendency to overeat, and when we consider this in-
dication with the opposition of Uranus and the con-
junction of Neptune, it is plain that Margery must not
be allowed to satisfy her appetite for food, or she will
become dyspeptic and her life will be made miserable
in consequence. Teach her to be frugal, and be sure
that you teach her by example, and not by precept,
for it cannot be expected that she will learn to like
plain food and be satisfied with it if she sees you indulge
in the delights of the table.

BARBARA S. - Born March 2, 1912, 2 a.m.,
Waterbury, Conn.

Here we find Jupiter rising in his own sign, Sagit-
tarius, in sextile with Venus, the planet of attraction
and love. This shows the aspiring nature of the Ego
entering life under that configuration, and an innate
kindly disposition. Unfortunately, however, she will
lack the power of expressing her feelings, for Saturn,
the planet of obstruction, is in Taurus, the sign which
governs the vocal organ, and square to Venus, the
ruler of Taurus. This will lead people to suppose that
she is cold and calloused, when, as a matter of fact,


80 YOUR HOROSCOPE
her heart is aching with love which she is powerless
to express. Goaded to desperation by the attitude of
her associates, and stung to the quick by their un-
merited reproach, the opposition of Mars, the energizer,
to Jupiter, and his square with Mercury, the planet of
expression, cause her to lose her temper and voice her
resentment in a manner that will seem to justify the
estimate formed of her by the people in her environ-
ment.
This is a cheerless delineation; it wrings the astrol-
oger's heart to write it, and were it not that the life is
still so young, and that we ardently believe in the power
of man to rule his stars, no power on earth could force
us to write this horoscope. But we know that there are
many unfortunate people of just such a disposition
as this child, who go through life misunderstood and
alone, and we rejoice at the privilege of showing
Barbara's parents her true inner nature so that they
may give her the love she needs more than life, and
save her from the fate of others whose relatives judge
only by outer appearances.
It is not enough, however, that the parents should
excuse, or pass over, her seeming indifference and lack
of affection, because of a belief that she feels it in her
heart. That would only be half-hearted help. You
must teach her to show her feelings so that all can see
them; that is the only way you can save her from being
misjudged by others and eventually becoming em-
bittered towards all mankind. Teach her to show you
how much she loves her doll and her kitten, to hug


YOUR HOROSCOPE 81
and caress them; encourage demonstrations of love
toward brothers and sisters or other companions. You
still have three of the precious seven years in which
the habits of life are formed, and you must work with
her early and late, in season and out of season; you
must put your whole heart into the task of bringing
her out of herself. You can do it, and your reward
will be sure when you have brought her out of "prison."
Some day you will hear the Master say: "I was in
prison and you freed me; enter into the joy prepared
for you." It is said that "man's necessity is God's op-
portunity." Those Egos who come to us with good,
strong, and virile horoscopes, who consequently grow
up in the loveliest manner imaginable, are usually re-
garded as great blessings to parents. So they are, but
when an Ego who is in dire need of help comes to
a home, it offers to the parents an opportunity for
service and soul-growth difficult to equal. You have
here, in Barbara, a chance that the Angels might envy,
We trust that you will utilize it nobly; nay, we feel you
will, for there must be some fine gold in your hearts
to have attracted this needy one.

Saturn, the planet of obstruction, in the fifth house,
which governs courtship, and square to Venus, the
planet of love, makes it unlikely that a marriage will
be consummated in this life. That is well, for you will
find the menses obstructed and there would be great
difficulty in parturition. Saturn in Taurus also gives
liability to cold in the throat, and by reflex action
through the opposite sign, Scorpio, a tendency to con-


82 YOUR HOROSCOPE

stipation. Encourage her to outdoor exercise, let her
sleep out-of-doors if possible, and give her as nourishing
a diet as possible. She needs it very much till she has
passed the period of adolescence, at any rate.

MARY A. B. - Born Feb. 9, 1916, 4 a.m., Phila-
delphia.

Here we find the aspirational sign Sagittarius on
the ASC, and therefore Jupiter, the planet of benevo-
lence and kindness, is ruler. He is essentially dignified
or strengthened by being placed in his other sign,
Pisces, and conjoined with Venus, the planet of har-
mony and love, which is exalted in this sign. Both
Jupiter and Venus are trine to Neptune, the planet of
spirituality, which is placed in Leo, the sign of the heart.
Thus we may conclude that Mary's basic nature is
aspiring, spiritual, and lovable, but there is also another
side to her as shown by the opposition of Mars, the
planet of fiery passion, in Leo, the sign of the heart, to
the Sun and the spasmodic Uranus.

Mary is not wishy-washy by any means, and if
anything happens that is not to her liking, you will
hear from her in no uncertain terms. She has the
moral courage to express herself, and that is by no
means a bad thing when one is otherwise mentally
balanced. Too many are afraid of standing up for a
principle. The worst part, however, is that whenever
Mary allows herself to take a decided stand, she will


YOUR HOROSCOPE 83

become too wrought up, and her health will suffer.
Saturn, the whip-lash of most people, is singularly
tied in Mary’s horoscope. He is weak in Cancer, which
is the sign of his detriment, and Cancer is intercepted,
limiting his power to hurt. He is also unaspected,
however, so he will not be allowed to scourge her.
Freed from the cold, restraining hand of Saturn, she
will respond the more readily to the fiery energy of
Mars, and burn herself out in enthusiasm wherever
she directs her energies. Naturally, this will mean
speedy exhaustion of her vitality, and unless she is
carefully guided, her health will be endangered. We
always preach against repression; the everlasting "don't"
directed at children by a certain class of parents is the
bane of many a life, but there are cases where the
parents may play the role of Saturn with great benefit
to the child. In fact, by supplying the energy of a
weak Mars, instilling energy into an indolent child, we
are helping it to overcome a disability and rule its stars.
By playing up Venus in the horoscope of a child whose
Mars in Scorpio squares Saturn (making it cruel), we
shall help it, and it is just as legitimate to play up
Saturn in the horoscope of a child where that is lacking.
Only, we must be very careful how we do it, for it is
like giving poison for a curative purpose. The doses
must be carefully modulated. One may give an enor-
mous amount of Venus love, or the Jupiter friendliness
and comradeship, without fear of administering an
overdose, but it requires great circumspection to drive
someone with the whip of Mars and not to be too cruel,


84 YOUR HOROSCOPE
or to hold him in the leash of Saturn and not run the
risk of becoming a kill-joy. So your task is difficult,
requiring the use of all your love and common sense
to guide yourself in this work. See that Mary learns
the lesson of self-restraint, for that is very necessary to
preserve her health and mental poise.
The Moon square Neptune predisposes to contact
with the invisible worlds and the beings which live
therein. As the aspect is inharmonious you will under-
stand that this tendency, if fostered, will bring her some
undesirable experiences, probably development of me-
diumship. For that reason do not allow her to come
in contact with psychics or attend spiritualistic circles.
Do your best to make her surroundings bright and
cheerful in the earliest years, for the saturnine sign
Capricorn always disposes to gloom, which the atmos-
phere of childhood may do much to modify.
With respect to health, we have already hinted
that the heart action is apt to be irregular on account
of Mars' placement in Leo, the sign which rules the
heart, in opposition to Uranus. But remember, nearly
all children are strong and healthy. It is the abuse of
the body that causes the weak spots to show. Now you
have the immense advantage of knowing that her heart
needs protection to keep it well and strong, and if that
is given during the years of growth, chances are that
you may some day say: "Oh, I do not believe that
there was anything in what that astrologer said; her
heart is as strong as an ox." In the meantime, it will
do no harm to apply the ounce of prevention.


YOUR HOROSCOPE 85
ROSALYND W. McL. — Born July 29, 1914,
12:15 p.m. Pittsburgh, Pa.

Here we have an illustration of what has often been
said about the ruler of a horoscope, namely, that it is
not necessarily the ruler of the ASC. The ruler must
be strong and well placed; it must be receiving a num-
ber of aspects; for it is the aspects that determine a
planet's influence, no matter whether they are good
or bad. In Rosalvnd's horoscope, Venus is ruler of
the ASC; she is elevated, in conjunction with Mars,
and sextile Mercury. That is good, and she will with-
out doubt have considerable influence in the life. From
Venus, Rosalvnd will obtain an uncommon command
of language; her power of expression will be forceful,
and at the same time it will have an unusual beauty.
The only danger is that Mars may, under adverse
directions, cause her to be a little impulsive in her
utterances.

But see Mercury; he is placed in the ninth house
which rules the higher mind. In one of his signs,
Gemini, we find Saturn, who is trine to the Moon.
As so often said, Saturn is most beneficial when operat-
ing upon the mind - signified by Mercury, Moon,
and the mercurial signs, also the third and ninth houses.
This configuration will therefore give Rosalvnd tact
and diplomacy of the first order, the tendency to im-
pulsiveness spoken of in the last paragraph being more
than counteracted by this aspect, so she will


36 YOUR HOROSCOPE
never give offence, and will be liked by everybody.
From his other sign, Virgo, Mercury receives the sup-
port of Mars and Venus as already mentioned, and its
elevation is considerably higher than that of Venus.
When we balance the claims to rulership of these
planets we find that it is a very close race, with Mer-
cury a little in the lead. It will be found that he
will play an even more prominent part in Rosalyn's
life than Venus, who rules the ASC. In other words,
she will be a lovely character, with the added charm
of a splendid intellect, and she will always be guided
in her actions by reason. This prominence of reason
is fortunate, for we find the Moon square to Neptune,
which is in the psychic sign, Cancer, and the ninth
house, the house of dreams and visions. Mercury is
also there. From this configuration a tendency to
dreams would develop, and they would run along an
undesirable channel, to mediumship, were not Mercury
so well fortified as already said. Be careful during
childhood and youth not to let her attend circles or
seances, or have anything to do with negative psychics,
for the Moon square Neptune, and the Sun opposing
Uranus, all from fixed signs, would make it hard for
her to resist.
She will be well provided for in life, for the Moon
is in the first house parallel Jupiter, the planet of
opulence, and those who have the Sun near the MC
rise accordingly in the social scale. As the Sun is in
the sign Leo, which governs the heart, and the fifth
house which deals with public institutions, she will


YOUR HOROSCOPE 87
probably obtain a position as teacher and do well in it.
The Sun is in a nebulous spot known as the Ascelli,
square with the Moon and opposition to Uranus. Thus
there is a tendency to eye-trouble, and it is fortunate
that we find it out so early, for it is always easier to
apply the ounce of prevention than a pound of cure.
Be sure to guard her from glaring sunlight, and any-
thing which may strain the eyes in childhood and
adolescence. It would be well to obtain advice from
an oculist for the general care of the eyes, then you
will have no difficulty, and she will easily outgrow this
tendency. The Sun in Leo, the sign which governs
the heart, square the flighty Moon and opposed by
Uranus, the planet of spasmodic irregular action, will
also interfere with the rhythm of the heartbeat and
incline towards palpitation. However, as said with
regard to the eyes, the ounce of prevention applied in
childhood easily counterbalances any tendency to trouble.
Then the body is still sound, and by the care of the
weak spots, which can be known only through astrology,
they are strengthened in the period of growth instead
of being weakened by overexertion.

JOHN MILLER A. — Born April 23, 1911, 8:20
a.m., Spokane, Washington.

Here is a difficult child who needs a great deal
of love and help from its parents, and we hope they
will realize what an opportunity for service and soul-


88 YOUR HOROSCOPE
growth has come to them in the care of this child.
If they do, and act accordingly, all three will reap a
rich harvest of treasure in heaven where neither moth
nor rust can corrupt it.
John has Neptune on the Ascendant in the lunar,
watery sign Cancer, sextile to the restless Mercury.
The wandering Moon is also conjoined with the ener-
getic Mars on the cusp of the watery sign Pisces, and
even the staid Jupiter and the slow Saturn are in
conjunction with the Moon's nodes, the Dragon's
Head and Tail, to make John restless, like a horse
chafing under its bit stamping, pawing, and with
every nerve quivering to be off, it matters not where,
just so that he goes, goes, goes into the wide world.
That is how John will feel, especially in the days of
childhood, when he is under restraint and cannot get
away. You may have to bear a great deal with him
because he will want to run away, but do not punish
him, no matter how often he does it. The poor child
is driven from within, by a force that he can neither
comprehend nor resist, so he cannot help running off
any more than water can refrain from running down
a hill. You cannot alter him in this respect, and it
will be very much better, for both you and the child,
if you try to work with him as he is, instead of as you
think he ought to be.
John will be very moody and morose at best, on
account of being unable to wander, as shown by Saturn,
the planet of worry and gloom, in opposition to Jupiter,
the planet of cheer, conjoined with the saturnine Drag-


YOUR HOROSCOPE 89
on's Tail. If you can show him that you understand
him and sympathize with him, he will run away less
often, and if he knows he is not going to be punished
he will return quicker, and will open up to you, so that
maybe you can make arrangements with some campers
out in the wilds which are not far from your home
and he can go off to them. Then you will know where
he is, and not be concerned about his safety. When
he reaches the age where he can go off, he will probably
want to go to sea, for you notice that the indications
of this trait of character come from watery signs and
the watery planets, Neptune and the Moon. Be sure,
however, that you dissuade him in the most thorough
manner from from ever entering the navy, for he will
not be able to endure the feeling that he is obliged to
stay there for a specified time. He would likely desert,
a very serious thing, which might affect the rest of his
life very detrimentally.
The Sun, giver of life and vitality, is sexile to
Mars, the planet of dynamic energy, so John will grow
up to be a strong, bright fellow with plenty of vim and
energy. So long as he is not restrained he will also
and escape the gloom indicated by Saturn
opposition Jupiter. However, these planets will have
an effect upon his health, and as they operate from
Taurus, the sign which rules the throat, and Scorpio,
the sign that has dominion over the generative and
eliminative organs, we may conclude that these parts
of the body will be affected. Saturn is obstructive,
Jupiter is expansive; expansion of the glands in


90 YOUR HOROSCOPE
the throat would mean enlarged tonsils and adenoids,
and a similar condition in the rectum means piles. But
if he can be kept dry and warm this trouble may be
avoided. If throat infection does develop, do not have
him operated upon; after puberty the trouble will pass
away; the tonsils are necessary organs, which should
not be removed.

LOUIS MARTIN P. - Born October 30, 1909,
2:10 a.m., Boston.

Here we have a youngster with common signs on
the angles and the Moon in the ninth house in her
exaltation-sign Taurus, showing him to be a born
dreamer. Jupiter, the planet of benevolence, and
Venus, the planet of love, are in mutual reception;
that is to say, Jupiter is in Libra, a sign governed by
Venus, and Venus is in Sagittarius, a sign governed
by Jupiter. This shows that Louis' day dreams will
be of a most beautiful and ideal nature; but unfor-
tunately this world is a poor world for dreamers.
While it is perfectly true that if it were not for
the dreamers there could be no progress in the world,
it is also a fact that the world is only benefited by
dreams in so far as the dreamers make their dreams
come true. To do that requires action, generally in
the face of criticism and skepticism such as most in-
ventors have to face. This is where the parents must
help Louis, for the common signs on the angles give


YOUR HOROSCOPE 91
him a tendency to waver and vacillate when he ought
to take decisive action; and he needs your aid to root
out the tendency. Teach him to help himself in every-
thing he can possibly do and help others besides. Never
do anything for him that is not entirely beyond his
mental, moral, or physical strength; for by so doing
you will enable him to work out his life to advantage
instead of dreaming it away. There is one saving fea-
ture about this matter: the Sun is in the fixed, martial
sign Scorpio, which helps to give considerable energy,
and the Moon is in the stubborn sign Taurus, which
helps to give persistence. The Moon is also sextile to
Mars, the planet of dynamic energy; thus you have not
an entirely common sign nature to work with, and there
is plenty of energy latent which can be brought out
by proper methods.
You will find that school will be very bothersome
to Louis, but do not let that discourage you; everyone
in the world cannot be an intellectual giant as yet, and
people are needed in other vocations where the quali-
fications do not demand a great deal of book learning.
With Jupiter and Venus in mutual reception, as already
mentioned, he will enjoy an outdoor life. You will
find that life on a cattle ranch or a stock farm will
bring out all the good points physically, make him
strong, healthy, and contented with life so that all the
schooling he needs is just enough to give him sufficient
insight in ordinary business matters. He will also do
well in some occupation connected with travel, for the
Moon is in her exaltation sign Taurus in the ninth


92 YOUR HOROSCOPE
house, which has to do with travel, and sextile to Mars
in the watery sign Pisces. Venus is in the other sign
of travel, Sagittarius, with the mercurial sign Gemini
on the Midheaven.
Be very careful to warn Louis never to have any-
thing to do with spiritualism, for Neptune is in the
psychic sign Cancer in opposition to Uranus. All the
children that have been born under that configuration
are naturally predisposed to psychic influences, and
in Louis' horoscope we find that Neptune is also square
to Saturn in Aries, which governs the head and brain,
and square to Mercury which governs the concrete
mind. From these indications it is very plain that if
Louis were ever to become much interested in spiritu-
alism, the disembodied entities in the invisible world
would find him an easy prey for obsession from which
it would be very difficult to free him.
With regard to his health: you should take care
to see that he does not catch cold in the head. He is
very apt to do that on account of the position of
Saturn in Aries, and the opposition of Mercury in
Libra shows that this will react in a nervous way upon
the kidneys and affect the urinary system. Your
climate is a rather strenuous one and the severe cold
in the winter time will have a tendency to aggravate
this trouble; therefore, as said, he should be given plenty
of warm clothing so that the sensitive parts are pro-
tected.


YOUR HOROSCOPE 93
DONALD B. — Born October 19, 1910, 11 p.m.,
Tres Pinos, Calif.
At Donald's birth we find the cardinal sign Cancer
rising, and three other cardinal signs are on the angles,
showing that his inherent nature is active and alert;
but we find that there are five planets in and about the
fourth house. When we see a grouping of the planets
in a figure, we are sure that the nature will be ex-
pressed in the direction indicated by the house and
sign involved. The fourth house stands for the home
and the condition in old age, so it is evident that Donald
is going to look out for a rainy day and see that when
it comes his home is supplied in every respect; whatever
vississitudes may befall along the journey of life there
will be no doubt about a snug harbor for the declining
years.
There is one serious flaw in Donald's nature which
is indicated by the planet Neptune in the fourth house
home sign, Cancer, and on the ASC. He will not
mingle freely with his fellowmen, but will try to shut
himself off, and this will make him very unpopular.
Mars in conjunction with Venus, the planet of love,
and also with Jupiter, the planet of benevolence, shows
a tendency towards despotism in the home. This, he
should be taught in childhood days, always leads to
disaster, for no home can be happy unless there is
forbearance and tolerance of other people. It will not
be so very difficult to eradicate this martial trait, for


94 YOUR HOROSCOPE
Mercury, the significator of mind, is in conjunction with
Venus, the planet of love, showing that he is really
very kindly disposed toward those who compose the
home circle. It is just a way he has about him of
expressing himself too sharply in a manner which will
give pain to others. The Moon, the other significator
of mind, is in her exaltation-sign Taurus, which is ruled
by Venus; this also shows the kindly disposition, and
her trine to Uranus, the planet of intuition, taken to-
gether with her sextile to Neptune, shows a very high
grade of inspirational capacity. Venus, the planet of
the beautiful, is the mother of art through the sign
Taurus; therefore, the Moon's position in that sign
and configuration means that Donald's talents will
find expression along artistic lines. The fact that
Venus is at home in her other sign Libra, a sign of
voice, and is trine to Mercury, the planet of speech,
points to music in general and vocal music in par-
ticular, as the avenue of expression of Donald's talents.
With respect to health, we find that the Moon is in
Taurus, the sign which governs the throat, and Neptune
is in Cancer, the sign ruling the stomach, which is also
a watery sign. Donald will therefore have a tendency
to indulge in liquids, though not necessarily of an in-
toxicating nature, but he will crave an abundance of
liquid, which of course, must be eliminated from the
system. This is where the trouble will be, for we find
Neptune square to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and the Sun,
all planets which are placed in Libra, the sign govern-
ing the kidneys. If the afflicted planets had been placed


YOUR HOROSCOPE 95
in the earlier degrees of Libra, we should find that the
trouble would be in the urethra; that is to say, the
small tubes which go from the kidneys to the bladder;
thus it would interfere with the secretion of the urine.
But here we find that the afflicted planets are in the
latter degrees of the sign Libra, and that means that the
trouble will be with the elimination through the ureter,
the duct which carries the urine from the bladder and
outward. The fact that Mars is in that place and so
afflicted shows that there will be plenty of room to pass
the water, but it will scald and burn like fire. This
testimony, is further augmented by the presence of the
Sun, which is also square to Neptune. If Saturn had
been the afflicted planet instead of Mars, his natural
obstructiveness would have operated to close the ureter
and thus produce a difficulty of elimination in another
way.
Saturn is in Taurus, the sign which rules the throat,
and he is unaspected, but nevertheless, wherever Saturn
is found there is always some trouble. You will there-
fore find that Donald will take cold easily and that his
throat will be the most sensitive point in his body.
Therefore, be sure to do what you can to strengthen it
during the years of childhood. Thus you will save him
considerable trouble in later years.

LILLIAN A. - Born May 29, 1912, 3 a.m., New
York City.

Here we have a little lady with a will of her own.
“When she says she will, she will, and you can depend
upon it; and when she says she won’t, she won’t, and
that is the end of it,” to quote an old doggerel. This
we see from the stubborn sign Taurus rising with
Saturn, the planet of persistence. Taurus is a sign of
voice and we find Mercury, the planet of speech, there,
opposed by the Moon, also significator of mind, from
the martial sign Scorpio. This will give Lillian a
tendency to talk more than necessary, and will also
make her too critical of her surroundings. Saturn, the
planet of obstruction, together with Venus, the planet
of love, shows that it will be very difficult to understand
Lillian. There is, as it were, two natures in her; one
extremely lovable, and the other exceedingly selfish.
Jupiter, the planet of benevolence, is in the eighth
house which has to do with legacies; it is parallel to the
Sun and Neptune, also Mars, the planet of dynamic
energy. This configuration of the Sun in the second
house, which deals with finance, shows that Lillian will
receive money by legacies; but as the aspects to the
Sun and Jupiter are adverse, she should be extra care-
ful how she expends money, for the tendency is to be
reckless and indiscreet. If she allows this tendency to
work itself out to reality she will reap sorrow from the
house of finance. On account of the tendency to


YOUR HOROSCOPE 97

reckless expenditures, it would be well for you to in-
culcate thrift from the very earliest childhood, for
Neptune and Mars in the fourth house are not good
omens for a cheerful old age, especially as Mars is
opposed by Uranus.

You must not be discouraged for your child, how-
ever, for the stars show only tendencies. She has a
very strong will, which it is your privilege to lead into
the right channels so that the things which are dis-
agreeable may be avoided by her during life. With
Virgo in the sixth house and Libra intercepted, also
the Moon in Scorpio, she is a born nurse, whether this
tendency is expressed in the home to help others or in
a vocational capacity.

With respect to her health, we find that Saturn in
Taurus conjunction Venus will give a tendency to cold
in the throat, while the Moon in Scorpio trine to
Neptune in the watery sign Cancer, shows a rather
copious menstrual flow. Mars, the planet of dynamic
energy, is in Leo, which governs the heart, and in op-
position to Uranus, the planet of spasmodic action.
You should be careful that she does not put too great
a strain upon the heart during the days of childhood,
for that is the time when that organ is most easily
overtaxed to the detriment of the succeeding life; but
by being careful not to let Lillian run, jump, or do
any other violent athletic exercises, you may apply
the ounce of prevention which makes unnecessary the
pound of cure.
