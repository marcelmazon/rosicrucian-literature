<h1 id="astrology-and-the-ductless-glands">Astrological Keyword System of Analyzing Character and Destiny</h1>

(By J.D.)

### <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

The system herein set forth is an analytical method of
reading the horoscope chart. It is developed along the lines
indicated by Max Heindel in *The Message Of The Stars*,
pages 405-408. It consists simply of combining the
keywords of the planets, signs, and houses to form key-
phrases, key-sentences and key-paragraphs, then the final
summing up of these to arrive at a composite judgment.

By this method anyone can read the message of a chart
in a fairly intelligent manner. There has been an idea in the
past that a high degree of intuition was necessary before
one could hope to do this. But this idea has largely been
disproved. Anyone who can combine simple elements and
reason from cause to effect can combine the keywords in a
chart to ascertain at least the essential part of its message.
Reference to dignities, exaltations, retrogradation,
interception and other minor factors is omitted, as only the
advanced student needs to consider them.

### <h3 id="steps-in-reading-an-aspect">Steps in Reading an Aspect</h3>

Steps 1 to 9 inclusive are preliminary and analytical in
character to show the student the reasoning which must be
done, consciously or subconsciously, before the summary
in step 10 is possible. With practice, however, students
will arrive at the point where they will be able to omit the
first nine steps and give the net result of step 10 without
this preliminary work.

1\. Determine the nature of the aspect, harmonious or
inharmonious, in the one case indicating that good
judgment is used and in the other case that the person goes
to extremes in the activities indicated by the aspect.

2\. Look up the keywords of the two planets entering
into the aspect. There are three sets. The *basic* keywords
apply in all cases. The positive qualities are used in
addition to the *basic* keywords with harmonious aspects.
The negative qualities are used in addition to the *basic*
keywords with inharmonious aspects. The word “negative"
is here used to denote the results of these qualities rather
than the qualities themselves.

3\. Ascertain the keywords for the two signs containing
the two planets. The positive qualities of the sign are used
in addition to its *basic* keywords when the planet in it is in
good aspect. The negative qualities of the sign are used
with the *basic* keywords when the planet is adversely
aspected.

4\. Combine the keywords of each planet with the
keywords of the sign in which it is placed to determine the
corresponding type of character.

5\. Combine the keywords of the two planets by
themselves, taking into account the aspect, harmonious or
inharmonious, indicating whether the qualities of the two
planets will work together or in opposition to each other,
to determine the character as given by the aspect in the
abstract.

6\. Ascertain the keywords for the two houses
containing the two planets.

7\. Combine the keywords of each planet with the
keywords of the house in which it is placed, leaving out of
consideration temporarily the aspect in order to determine
the planetary influence in the house.

8\. Consider the action of the affairs of one house upon
the affairs of the other as brought about by the aspect
between the two planets, that is, a harmonious aspect will
enable the affairs of one house to reinforce those of the
other and an inharmonious aspect will cause the affairs of
one house to detract from those of the other.

9\. Consider the reaction of the affairs of the second of
the two houses upon those of the first, following the
method indicated in step 8.

10\. Correlate and balance all the elements above
mentioned into one composite judgment which will
express in everyday language the net results without any
reference to aspects or other astrological elements.

11\. When reading an entire horoscope, correlate and
balance similarly the effects of all the planets, their house
and sign positions, and their aspects.

(See page 12 for example of method of reading an aspect).

### <h3 id="keywords-of-aspects">Keywords of Aspects</h3>

The keyword of an aspect is usually a verb denoting
action which connects the affairs ruled by one planet, its
sign and house, with the affairs ruled by the other planet
and its sign and house.

The keywords of the sextile and trine are verbs which
express reinforcement, assistance, ease and cooperation.

The keywords of the square are verbs which express
obstruction, inharmony, strife, struggle or detraction.

The keywords of the opposition in the case of the
average person are similar to those of the square. The
opposition, however, usually brings into play the two
directly opposite signs of the zodiac which constitute the
two poles of one department of nature. Therefore these two
signs have a certain affinity between them which tends to
reduce the inharmony of the opposition and make it less
than that of the square. For instance, Leo represents the
personal love for one's own children and Aquarius
represents the impersonal, universal, altruistic love for the
children of all people, namely, humanity. Therefore the
opposition of Jupiter in Leo to the Sun in Aquarius, for
example, is not as inharmonious as the square between
Jupiter in Leo and the Sun in Scorpio, the sign of
militarism and force. In the case of advanced egos the
opposition may become an aspect of great power.

The keywords of the conjunction are the same as those
for the trine or the square depending respectively on
whether the conjunction is harmonious or inharmonious.
For information as to the harmony and inharmony of con-
junctions see Simplified Scientific Astrology, pages 98-99.

### <h3 id="general-notes">General Notes</h3>

Planets represent the driving forces.

Signs represent the static forces which color and modify
the influence of the planets.

Planets in signs indicate the character and inner capacities.

Planets in houses give the circumstantial details of the life.

The aspects indicate harmony or disharmony between the
planetary influences.

### <h3 id="key-to-the-chart">Key to the Chart</h3>

Astrology is a science of probabilities. Any aspect,
position or configuration may represent any one of a
number of possibilities and the only way to get a
reasonable line on which one of these will develop is first
to ascertain the key to the chart as a whole. The key is
usually found in some strong group of planets or in the
ruling planet. For instance, if a person has the 12th house
occupied by two or three of the strong planets, we know
that he is more or less of the mystical type and he will
therefore be interested in the mystical aspect of life. Then,
since he is mystically inclined, if in the same chart there
are planets in the 8th house, which rules legacies and also
latent occult ability and regeneration, we judge that the
native will be more interested in the two latter matters than
in legacies of money or property, and that legacies
therefore will play a comparatively unimportant part in his
life even if he should receive any.

### <h3 id="no-evil-in-planetary-vibrations">No Evil in Planetary Vibrations</h3>

There is no evil in any planet. The only evil that may
result from planetary vibrations comes from our misuse of
them or our inability to control them. Any planet emits
exactly the same vibrations at all times, but the square
between two planets tends to incite to excess in the use of
these vibrations and to carry activities that come under
their influence to such an extreme that they become evil.

### <h3 id="example-of-the-method-of-reading-an-aspect">Example of the Method of Reading an Aspect</h3>

The Sun in Capricorn in the 7th House Sextile to
Saturn in Scorpio in the 5th House:

#### <h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>

1\. - The sextile aspect is harmonious indicating that the
native uses good judgment in all matters ruled by this
aspect.

2\. - The keywords of the Sun and Saturn may be found
above. Use the basic and positive keywords in both cases.

3\. - The keywords of Scorpio and Capricorn will also be
found above. Use the basic and positive keywords in both
cases.

4\. - Sun in Capricorn: Justice (Capricorn) blended with
generosity (Sun). Ambition (Sun) for position and honor
(Capricorn).

Saturn in Scorpio: Persistence and concentration (Saturn)
in investigating the secret forces of nature (Scorpio) such
as those of chemistry or occultism. Conservative (Saturn)
in methods of healing (Scorpio).

5\.  The Sun sextile Saturn: Diplomacy and tact (Saturn) in
all dealings with men (Sun). Capability of effort (Sun)
sustained (Saturn) over a long period.

6\. The keywords of the 5th and 7th houses may be found
above.

7\. The Sun in the 7th house: The main ambitions of the
life (Sun) are in connection with partnerships (7th) and the
public or some form of publicity (7th). This gives a
generous and virile (Sun) marriage partner (7th).

Saturn in the 5th house: Conservative (Saturn) in
educational methods (5th), also in investments (5th).
Systematic (Saturn) in publishing matters (5th). Few
(Saturn) children (5th). Serious (Saturn) in pleasures (5th).

8\. Action of the 5th house affairs upon those of the 7th,
using the Sevenfold combination of Keywords:

Here we have seven keywords to combine into a key
sentence or paragraph. These keywords are those of the
Sun, Saturn, Capricorn, Scorpio, 5th house, 7th house and
the sextile. Through persistence and diplomacy (Saturn)
the native has the capacity to succeed in publishing (5th)
articles or books on chemistry or occult philosophy
(Scorpio) or some other branch of science. These books
would bring (sextile) him publicity (7th), gain (sextile) him
the confidence of men in authority (Sun) and enhance
(sextile) his position in the world (Capricorn).

9\. Reaction of the 7th house affairs upon those of the 5th,
using the Sevenfold Combination of keywords:

Partnerships (7th) are likely to be formed with those in
authority (Sun) and through them the native rises in
position and power (Capricorn). The resulting publicity
(7th) would help (sextile) him to sell the books he had
published (5th) and through his thrift (Saturn) he would
conserve the income from his books (5th). He would thus
be enabled to start an educational system (5th) devoted to
some secret science (Scorpio) or to healing (Scorpio)
through the power of concentration (Saturn).

10\. Summary in non-technical language:

### <h3 id="character-of-the-native">Character of the Native</h3>

The individual has a strong, stable character so far as
this aspect goes. He is worthy of trust, commands the
confidence of men and is capable of holding positions of
responsibility, in which he will use diplomacy and be
faithful to his trust. He is patient, persistent and capable of
sustained effort in any chosen line of endeavor. He is
generous to a certain degree but prudence rules his
generosity. He has an ambition to rise in the world. He has
a liking for the secret sciences and the ability to investigate
them by analytical means. He is conservative in his
business methods and has good judgment in the matter of
investments. He is serious in his pleasures.

### <h3 id="circumstantial-details-of-the-life-of-the-native">Circumstantial Details of the Life of the Native</h3>

He will gain the confidence of men in positions of
prominence, who will perceive his ability and help him to
rise to places of authority and trust. His rise will be slow
but steady. He should be successful in entering into
partnerships which will promote his material interests. He
has the possibility of succeeding in the field of
publications, educational work or the investment field. He
may specialize in or make any one of these his major work.
He will obtain throughout his life a considerable amount of
favorable publicity as the result of the above conditions.
He should be successful in marriage and will probably
marry a woman of the vital, commanding type who is also
ambitious for material success. He will have few children.
They will, however, be well brought up but subjected to
considerable discipline.

As indicated on page 2, the preliminary analysis of
steps 1 to 9, inclusive, may be omitted after sufficient
practice and the net result of step 10 given at once.

### <h3 id="alternate-method">Alternate Method</h3>

An abbreviated method which does not give as
complete results as the above is merely to select a keyword
for each of the planets, signs and houses involved and also
one for the aspect. Then combine these into a sentence that
indicates a plausible, reasonable deduction. By using
different keywords several such sentences may be made,
each indicating some possible aspect or phase of the life.
This is in reality an expansion of step 8, omitting all the
other steps.
