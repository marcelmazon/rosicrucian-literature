<h1 id="short-biography-of-max-heindel">Short Biography of Max Heindel</h1>

Max Heindel, spiritual Initiate and messenger of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood,  was born in Denmark on July 23, 1865. He became a shipping engineer and  eventually immigrated to the United States. By 1905 he had become seriously  interested in the study of metaphysics and spent the next few years consciously  working and searching for spiritual Truths. When he was visiting Germany in  1907, the Elder Brother of the Rose Cross who became his Teacher made  contact with him on the inner planes. He was instructed in the etheric Temple of  the Rose Cross, receiving the occult Teachings that he eventually incorporated  into The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception, published in November 1909. He  founded The Rosicrucian Fellowship in August 1909, and spent his remaining  years, until January 6, 1919, writing, lecturing, establishing Fellowship  Headquarters in Oceanside, California, and generally spreading the Teachings  of Esoteric Christianity — the pioneer spiritual Teachings which will prepare all  humanity for the New Age of Aquarius, when all nations will join in Universal  Brotherhood.
