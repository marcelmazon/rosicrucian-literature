Max Heindel, spiritual Initiate and messenger of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood, 
was born in Denmark on July 23, 1865. He became a shipping engineer and 
eventually immigrated to the United States. By 1905 he had become seriously 
interested in the study of metaphysics and spent the next few years consciously 
working and searching for spiritual Truths. When he was visiting Germany in 
1907, the Elder Brother of the Rose Cross who became his Teacher made 
contact with him on the inner planes. He was instructed in the etheric Temple of 
the Rose Cross, receiving the occult Teachings that he eventually incorporated 
into The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception, published in November 1909. He 
founded The Rosicrucian Fellowship in August 1909, and spent his remaining 
years, until January 6, 1919, writing, lecturing, establishing Fellowship 
Headquarters in Oceanside, California, and generally spreading the Teachings 
of Esoteric Christianity — the pioneer spiritual Teachings which will prepare all 
humanity for the New Age of Aquarius, when all nations will join in Universal 
Brotherhood.

"Divine symbols which have been given to mankind from time to 
time speak to that forum of truth which is within our hearts, and waken 
our consciousness to divine ideas entirely beyond words." — Max Heindel. 
The Emblem of the Western Mystery School of the Rosicrucians is one 
such symbol: in its entirety it represents God in manifestation. It expresses 
the key to man's past evolution, his present constitution, his future 
development, and the method of attainment. 

The blue background represents God the Father; the golden star 
symbolizes Christ born within the spiritual aspirant and radiating from the 
five points — the head and four limbs; the red roses indicate the 
purification of the human desire nature on the cross of matter — the blood 
of the aspirant cleansed from passion. The white rose symbolizes purity of 
heart and also the larynx with which, once purified, humanity will speak 
the Creative Word. The white cross represents the physical body. The 
golden star represents the "Golden Wedding Garment" — the etheric 
vehicle which the Spirit builds during lifetimes of purity and service. 

Another reading shows that the cross also indicates plant, animal and 
human life-waves. The lower limb is the plant nourished through the roots 
with spiritual currents from the Earth; man, the upper limb, receives 
spiritual influences from the Sun through the head; animals are sustained 
by spiritual currents horizontally surrounding the Earth. 

The lamp of wisdom and the heart show the two streams of evolving 
humanity: those following the path of intellect (occult) and those 
following the path of love (mystic). There can be no contradiction in 
Nature, therefore the heart and the mind must be capable of uniting. 
Eventual union of head and heart will signify the Perfected Man. 

At the foot of the page is the fleur-de-lis, the emblem of the 
Trinity — Father, Son and Holy Spirit — but as only the Father and Holy 
Spirit were active at the time here represented, we find but two of the 
petals colored with red, thus showing energy. 

The beings created we see as a stream flowing upwards, provided 
with two bodies, the dense and the vital, but after a time the desire body is 
added and is shown by the red appearing in the ascending stream. 

Although each stream looks alike outwardly, they are vastly 
different. The one on the left is known in our literature as the Sons of 
Cain. They are full of positive energy and are the craftsmen of the world, 
the phree-messen, who carve their way through life, rather enjoying the 



obstacles which they know strengthen the character; they work through 
the intellect, as is shown by the lamp from the flame of which proceed 
nine rays, showing the positive path chosen by the esoteric student. 

The other stream develops the heart side of life, and the divine flame 
proceeding from it shows but eight rays, a negative path; those following 
it desiring that they should have a leader; someone to follow, someone to 
worship; they are the churchmen of the world who obey the teachings of 
their leaders. 

Each stream of life flows onward side by side till a time comes when 
the wise and loving ones guiding the evolution decide that to hasten 
progress it is necessary that the two unite, and plan that this shall be 
accomplished by the building of a temple for the worshippers by the 
craftsmen and that both streams would unite in a Mystical Molten Sea. 
We can see the wonderful impulse by the chalice raised from each and 
filled with the red wine of life. You will read the story of this in the 
building of Solomon' s Temple. This plan was frustrated by the treachery 
of the Sons of Seth — those on the right. And after this each swung further 
away from the other than before. 

A serious condition now is shown in which some appear to fall away 
entirely through materialism. But still the race lives on, the churchman 
and the scientist, the mystic and the occultist, each pursuing their own 
path independent of the other, till a stage of such materialism is reached 
that the spiritual guiders see grave dangers ahead. To prevent the plan of 
evolution being defeated, a great destruction of the human bodies is 
permitted which for a time looks as if it would wipe humanity off the 
earth. See the break in each stream. But this calamity has the desired 
effect: we now see again great force and each stream turned directly 
toward the other, where they may shortly unite as one. At the foot of the 
page we find another symbol, so small that you may have overlooked it. 
Here is a small black cross that represents the physical body. In the 
enlarged head of the cross is seen the heart. Heart and head have united 
and the result is shown in the spreading ray — the resultant soul body.
