"Who never ate his bread in sorrow, 
Who never spent the midnight hours, 
Weeping, waiting for the morrow, 
He knows ye not, ye heavenly powers."

"A god can love without cessation, 
But under laws of alteration 
We mortals need, in changing measure, 
Our share of pain as well as pleasure."

Rosicrucians such as Paracelsus, Commenius, Bacon, Helmont and others gave hints in their works and influenced others. The great controversy concerning the authorship of Shakespeare (which has to no avail blunted so many goose-quills and wasted so much good ink that might have served useful ends) would never have arisen had it been known that the similarity in Shakespeare and Bacon is due to the fact that both were influenced by the same Initiate, who also influenced Jacob Boehme and a pastor of Ingolstadt, Jacobus Baldus, who lived subsequent to the death of the Bard of Avon, and wrote Latin lyric verse. If the first poem of Jacob Baldus is read with a certain key, it will be found that by reading down and up the lines, the following sentence will appear: "Hitherto I have spoken from across the sea by means of the drama; now I will express myself in lyrics." 

In his "Physica," Commenius, the Rosicrucian wrote: "Ad huc spiritum incognitum Gas voco," i.e., "This hitherto unknown Spirit I call Gas." Further on in the same work he says. "This vapor which I have called Gas is not far removed from the Chaos the ancients spoke of."
