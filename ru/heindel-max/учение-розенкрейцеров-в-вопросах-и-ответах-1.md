    - [Question No. 165: Are not enormous and destructive reptiles created by the evil thoughts of men, so far as the form is concerned? And, therefore, is it not an act of love to kill them and thus liberate the divine spark within so that it may occupy a higher form?](#question-165)

### <h3 id="a-word-of-explanation">Краткое пояснение</h3>

Вопросы, содержащиеся в этой книге, задавались автору после лекций, которые он проводил в различных городах. В большинстве случаев они демонстрируют определенное знание предмета спрашивающими.

Тех, кто не знаком с космоконцепцией розенкрейцеров, было бы полезно ознакомить с философией и используемыми терминами. Пользуясь этими ключами, каждый сможет понять ответы на вопросы. Следует отметить, что на каждый вопрос давался ответ независимо от того, какие ответы были даны на любые другие вопросы, так что каждый ответ — полный сам по себе. Подобный подход привел к некоторым повторениям в ответах на схожие вопросы, но оказалось, что во всех случаях эти повторения открывают новые стороны предмета. Поэтому автору можно и не просить извинения за повторы, поскольку он считает, что примененный метод обладает большей ценностью, чем ссылки на другие ответы, которые, возможно, спрашивающий не найдет времени посмотреть.

Философия розенкрейцеров учит, что человек — это сложное существо, обладающее:

1\. Плотным телом, которое является видимым инструментом, тем, что он использует в этом мире для перемещения и переноса; мы обычно думаем, что это тело и есть весь человек.

2\. Жизненным телом, созданным из эфира и пропитывающим видимое тело, подобно тому, как эфир пронизывает все прочие формы, с единственным отличием в том, что человеческие существа усваивают гораздо больше эфира вселенной, чем другие формы. Это жизненное тело является нашим инструментом для усвоения жизненной энергии Солнца.

3\. Телом желаний, являющимся нашей эмоциональной сущностью. Это более тонкий проводник, который пропитывает как жизненное, так и плотное тело. С помощью ясновидения установлено, что он выступает примерно на 16 дюймов за границы нашего видимого тела, расположенного в центре яйцевидного облака, как желток в центре белка.

4\. Умом, который является зеркалом, отражающим внешний мир и дающим возможность Эго посылать команды в виде мысли и слова, а также осуществлять действия.

Эго представляет собой тройственный Дух, использующий эти проводники для того, чтобы набирать опыт в школе жизни.

### <h3 id="question-1">Вопрос 1</h3>

Если мы были чистым духом и частью Всезнающего Бога, почему нам пришлось предпринять столь длительное странствование, полное греха и скорби, через материю?

Ответ: В начале проявления Бог выявил внутри Себя множество потенциальных духовных разумных сущностей, подобных искрам, которые исходят из костра. Итак, эти духовные разумные сущности были потенциальным огнем, или пламенем, но они еще не были огнем, поскольку наделялись всесознанием Бога, не имея самосознания; будучи потенциально всесильными, подобно Богу, они нуждались в динамической силе, пригодной к использованию в любой момент по их желанию. Для того чтобы эти качества могли развиться, было совершенно необходимо пройти через материю. Поэтому в процессе инволюции каждая Божественная Искра была заключена в различные проводники соответствующей плотности, чтобы изолировать внешний мир от ее сознания. Тогда дух внутри, лишенный возможности взаимодействовать с духом снаружи, поворачивается и находит себя. С пробуждением самосознания приходит духовная борьба за освобождение себя из темницы, и в процессе эволюции различные проводники, которыми обладает дух, будут одухотворены и впитаны душой, чтобы в конце проявления дух обладал не только самосознанием, но и силой души.

Большинство людей склонно верить, что все, что является результатом чего-то другого, не способно к созданию ничего нового и самобытного. Те, кто изучает жизнь, обычно говорят только об инволюции и эволюции; те, кто изучает форму, а именно современные ученые, интересуются только эволюцией, но наиболее передовые из них начинают сейчас находить другой фактор, который они называют эпигенезом. Уже в 1757 году Каспар Вульф издал свою «Теорию происхождения», в которой он продемонстрировал, что при развитии яйца происходит серия новых построений, абсолютно непредсказуемых на основании того, что было раньше, и Хикель, поддерживая эту работу, пишет, что в наше время уже не оправданно называть эпигенез теорией. Ибо это факт, который мы можем продемонстрировать для низших форм, где изменения происходят быстро и сразу видны под микроскопом. С того момента, когда человек получил ум, именно этот основной созидательный импульс, эпигенез, стал причиной всего нашего развития. Мы действительно отталкиваемся от того, что уже было создано, но, кроме того, существует что-то новое как результат деятельности духа, благодаря которой мы становимся творцами, так как если бы мы только имитировали то, что нам было предоставлено Богом или Ангелом, мы никогда не смогли бы стать творческими разумными сущностями; мы были бы просто имитаторами. И хотя мы совершаем ошибки, можно сказать, что мы гораздо лучше учимся на них, нежели на успехах. Грех и страдания, о которых говорит спрашивающий, в основном результат совершаемых ошибок, и их воздействие на наше сознание заставляет нас проявлять активность в других направлениях, которые оказываются благими — иначе говоря, находятся в гармонии с природой. Итак, этот мир есть школа обучения, а не долина слез, в которую нас поместил капризный Бог (см. вопрос 9).

### <h3 id="question-2">Вопрос 2</h3>

Если «Бог унизил человека перед Ангелами», как человек в конечном счете превзойдет их в духовном мире?

Ответ: Этот вопрос демонстрирует некоторое непонимание со стороны спрашивающего. В учении розенкрейцеров такого никогда не утверждалось, и дело, вероятно, заключается в неправильном толковании некоторых высказываний. Дело в том, что эволюция движется по спирали и те же самые условия никогда не повторяются. Ангелы — это более ранняя волна эволюции, они были человечеством во время предыдущего воплощения Земли, которое розенкрейцеры называют периодом Луны. Архангелы были человечеством в период Солнца, и Владыки Ума, которых апостол Павел назвал Силами Тьмы, были человечеством в темный период Сатурна. Мы являемся человечеством четвертого периода данной схемы проявления, периода Земли. Поскольку все создания во вселенной совершенствуются, человечества предыдущих периодов тоже совершенствовались, и сейчас они на более высокой ступени, чем в то время, когда они были человечеством — они находятся на сверхчеловеческом уровне. Поэтому совершенно верно, что Бог сделал человека ниже Ангелов. Но поскольку все находится в состоянии развития по спирали, так же верно и то, что современное человечество является более высокоуровневой и развитой стадией человеческой ступени, чем были Ангелы; а Ангелы были человечеством более высокого порядка, чем Архангелы в свое время. На следующей стадии мы достигнем ступени, аналогичной уровню современных Ангелов, но более высокой, чем та, на которой они находятся сейчас.

### <h3 id="question-3">Вопрос 3</h3>

Почему нам было необходимо проходить физическое существование? Неужели мы не могли бы выучить те же уроки, если бы нас не заключали в тюрьму суровых условий материального мира с его ограничениями?

Ответ: Новый Завет изначально был написан по-гречески, и слово «Логос» означает как слово, так и мысль, предшествующую миру, таким образом, когда Иоанн пишет в первой главе своего Евангелия, что «В начале было слово, и слово было у Бога, и слово было Бог», мы можем также перевести этот стих и так: «В начале была мысль, и мысль была у Бога, и Бог был мыслью. Все существует благодаря этому факту (слову-мысли). В том числе и то, что мы называем жизнью».

Все, что существует во вселенной, сначала было мыслью, эта мысль проявлялась как слово, звук, который строит все формы и выражает себя, как жизнь в этих формах. Это процесс созидания, и человек, созданный по образу Божию, созидает до определенной степени точно так же. У него есть способность мыслить; он умеет выражать свои мысли и таким образом, когда он не в состоянии осуществить свои замыслы в одиночку, может обеспечить себе помощь остальных, чтобы их реализовать. Но придет время, когда он будет созидать непосредственно словом, исходящим из его уст; однако сейчас он обучается творить другими средствами, чтобы в должное время обладать знанием, как использовать свое слово для непосредственного созидания. Такое обучение абсолютно необходимо. В настоящее время он бы сделал много ошибок. Более того, человек еще недостаточно добродетелен — и мог бы порождать демонические создания.

На заре своих начинаний человек использовал твердые тела; мускульная сила была для него единственным средством выполнения работы, и из костей и камней, которые он подбирал с земли, он мастерил свои первые грубые инструменты, чтобы работать руками. Затем пришло время, когда он в неуклюжей, выдолбленной из дерева лодке впервые доверил себя водам; жидкость и водяное колесо были первым механизмом. Жидкость гораздо сильнее твердых тел. Волна полностью может разрушить палубу корабля, вырвать мачту, скрутить крепчайший железный прут, словно тоненькую проволоку; но сила воды — стационарная сила, поэтому она ограничена в работе своим непосредственным местоположением. Когда человек научился использовать гораздо более тонкую силу, которую он назвал воздух, стало возможным сооружать ветряные мельницы везде, где надо было работать, и парусные суда объединили весь мир средствами сообщения. Итак, следующий шаг человека в его развитии был осуществлен посредством использования силы более тонкой, чем вода, и более универсально применимой, чем этот элемент. Но ветер переменчив и ненадежен; поэтому продвижение человеческой цивилизации было незначительным, пока человек не открыл, как использовать еще более тонкий газ, который он назвал паром, так как его можно получить где угодно и когда угодно, и с его появлением мировой прогресс чрезвычайно ускорился. Однако существует определенный недостаток при его использовании: паровая энергия требует громоздкого передаточного механизма. Этот недостаток практически отсутствует у еще более тонкой силы, еще легче передаваемой — электричества, совершенно невидимого и неосязаемого.

Итак, мы видим, что развитие человека в прошлом зависело от использования сил все большей разреженности, причем передача каждой последующей силы оказывалась более легкой задачей, чем для предшествующей, доступной ранее. И нам становится очевидно, что дальнейший прогресс зависит от открытия еще более тонких сил, передаваемых с еще большей легкостью. Мы знаем: то, что называют беспроволочным телеграфом, работает без использования проволоки, но даже эта система не идеальна, поскольку зависит от энергии, вырабатываемой центральной стационарной станцией. Эта система включает использование дорогостоящих механизмов и поэтому недоступна для большинства. Идеальной силой была бы такая энергия, которую человек производил сам в любой момент без применения механизмов.

Несколько десятилетий назад Жюль Верн приводил нас в восторг, потрясая наше воображение подводной лодкой, путешествием вокруг Земли за восемьдесят дней и прочими чудесами. Теперь то, что он описывал, обрело реальность, превосходящую даже его воображение. Наступит день, когда в нашем распоряжении будет источник энергии, упомянутый выше. Бульвер Литтон в книге «Грядущая раса» описал силу, названную им «врил». Ею обладают некие воображаемые существа, которые могут использовать ее для передвижения по земле, по воздуху и в ряде других случаев. Подобная сила скрыта внутри каждого из нас, и иногда мы говорим о ней как об эмоции. Временами мы чувствуем ее далеко проникающую силу как вспыльчивость, и, когда она высвобождается, говорим: «Человек потерял контроль над собой». Никакой объем физической работы не может так утомить и разрушить физическое тело, как при высвобождении телом желаний огромного количества энергии во время приступа раздражения. В настоящее время эта сила обычно спит, и хорошо, чтобы так оно и было, пока мы не научимся использовать ее посредством мысли, являющейся гораздо более тонкой силой. Этот мир — школа, обучающая нас думать и чувствовать правильно, чтобы мы получили право использовать эти две тонкие силы — силу мысли и силу эмоций.

Следующая иллюстрация поясняет, как этот мир служит данной цели. У изобретателя появляется замысел. Замысел еще не мысль, это как бы вспышка, которая пока не приобрела форму. Но постепенно он мысленно представляет свой замысел все отчетливей. Он создает в своих мыслях механизм, который предстает перед его мысленным взором; его колесики вращаются туда и обратно, так, как это необходимо для завершения работы. Затем он начинает рисовать чертеж механизма, и именно на этой стадии конкретизации наиболее вероятно, что появится необходимость в изменениях. Таким образом, мы видим, что всегда физические условия показывают изобретателю, где его мысль не была верной. Когда он строит машину из соответствующего материала для завершения работы, обычно возникает необходимость в дополнительных изменениях. Возможно, он будет вынужден отказаться от первоначального механизма. Так определенные физические условия дают ему возможность определить ошибку в своих рассуждениях; они заставляют вносить необходимые изменения в первоначальный замысел, чтобы создать действительно рабочий механизм. Если бы существовал только мир Мыслей, он бы не узнал, что совершил ошибку, но определенные физические условия показали ему, где он ошибался.

Физический мир учит изобретателя верно мыслить, и его удачные механизмы — воплощение его правильных мыслей.

В коммерческой, социальной и благотворительной сферах приложения усилий действует тот же принцип. Если наши идеи, касающиеся различных проблем жизни, ложны, они исправляются при так называемом практическом применении, и таким образом этот мир является абсолютно необходимым для обучения нас тому, как применять силу мысли и желания. В настоящее время данные силы в большой степени сдерживаются условиями нашего материального мира. Но со временем наша способность правильно мыслить совершенствуется, и в конце концов мы обретем такую силу мысли, что будем в состоянии правильно мыслить сразу в каждом случае, без экспериментирования. И тогда мы сможем словом воплощать свои мысли в реальные вещи. Во времена далекого, далекого прошлого, когда человек был еще духовным существом, а условия Земли были более пластичными, Бог обучил его использовать слово непосредственно для созидания, и человек творчески работал над растениями и животными. В Библии написано, что Бог привел животных к человеку, чтобы тот называл их. Но это присваивание имен не было простым называнием льва львом, это был созидательный процесс, который давал человеку власть над называемыми им существами. Так продолжалось до тех пор, пока эгоизм, жестокость и необузданный гнев не лишили его власти над ними, и слово силы, о котором упоминают масоны, было утеряно. Когда святость опять займет место богохульства, слово будет найдено вновь и станет созидательной силой божественного человека в будущем веке.

### <h3 id="question-4">Вопрос 4</h3>

Если жизнь на Земле так важна и действительно является основой всего нашего душевного роста, то есть последний есть результат опыта, получаемого здесь, то почему наша земная жизнь столь коротка по сравнению с жизнью во внутренних мирах, которая составляет примерно тысячу лет между двумя земными жизнями?

Ответ: Все, что в этом мире сделано руками человека, является кристаллизовавшимися мыслями; стулья, на которых мы сидим, дома, в которых мы живем, различные удобства, такие, как телефон, паровоз, локомотив, и так далее, были когда-то мыслями в уме человека. Если бы не эти мысли, вещи никогда бы не появились. Подобным образом деревья, цветы, горы и моря — кристаллизовавшиеся мысленные формы природных сил. Человек, покидая свое тело после смерти и вступая на Второе небо, становится заодно с этими природными силами; он работает под управлением Творческих Иерархий, создавая для себя окружение, необходимое для следующего шага в своем развитии. Там, в «умственном веществе», он создает архетипы земли и моря; он работает над флорой и фауной; все, создаваемое им, представляет собой мыслеформы, и, поскольку он меняет условия, созданное им появляется, когда он рождается опять.

Но создание вещей в уме сильно отличается от создания их в реальности. В настоящее время мы очень слабые мыслители, и потому нам требуется огромный период времени, чтобы придать мыслям форму на Втором небе. Кроме того, приходится ждать значительное время, пока эти мыслеформы кристаллизуются в реальную плотную физическую окружающую обстановку, в которую мы должны вернуться. Отсюда необходимо, чтобы мы оставались в Небесном мире гораздо дольше, чем мы находимся в земной жизни. Когда мы научимся правильно мыслить, то сможем создавать вещи здесь, в Физическом мире, за более короткое время, чем требуется сейчас для их — пока весьма трудоемкого — формирования. И тогда не нужно будет оставаться так долго вне Земли, как это требуется сейчас.

### <h3 id="question-5">Вопрос 5</h3>

Сколько еще пройдет времени, пока мы сможем обходиться без физических тел и опять всецело действовать в духовных мирах?

Ответ: Этот вопрос демонстрирует умонастроения, обычные среди тех, кто впервые узнал о том, что у нас есть духовные тела, в которых можно передвигаться в пространстве с быстротой молнии, которым не нужна одежда и которые поэтому не требуют заботы со стороны своего хозяина. Такие люди страстно ожидают того времени, когда они смогут вырастить метафорические крылья и полностью избавиться от этого «низкого и безжалостного круговорота».

Такие умонастроения в большой степени заслуживают сожаления. Мы должны быть благодарны своему физическому инструменту, так как это наиболее ценный из всех наших проводников. Хотя физическое тело поистине является низшим изо всех наших проводников, фактически этот проводник наиболее законченный среди наших инструментов, и без него в настоящее время было бы мало проку в других проводниках. Тогда как этот блестяще организованный проводник позволяет нам соответствовать здесь тысяче и одному условию, наши высшие проводники практически не организованы. Наше жизненное тело образуется орган за органом подобно плотному физическому телу, но, не будучи натренировано эзотерическими упражнениями, оно не может функционировать как самостоятельный инструмент. Тело желаний имеет только несколько центров чувств, которые у большинства людей даже не активизированы, а что касается ума, то у подавляющей массы людей он представляет собой неоформленное облако. Сегодня нам следует нацелиться на одухотворение физического инструмента и понимание того, что мы должны тренировать свои высшие тела, прежде чем можно будет их использовать. Для огромной массы людей этот процесс займет много, много времени. Поэтому самое лучшее — выполнять наши непосредственные повседневные обязанности, и тогда мы приблизим день, когда сможем использовать свои высшие проводники, ибо этот день зависит от нас самих.

### <h3 id="question-6">Вопрос 6</h3>

Когда дух входит в тело — во время зачатия или во время рождения?

Ответ: С помощью ясновидения было установлено, что во время смерти дух уносит с собой силы одного маленького атома, расположенного в левом желудочке сердца. Этот атом называется атом-семя, так как он является ядром, или семенем, вокруг которого собирается весь материал тела, причем каждый атом тела должен обладать способностью вибрировать в унисон с этим атомом-семенем. Поэтому этот атом закладывается в сперму отца незадолго до зачатия и позже помещается в матку матери. Но зачатие и сексуальный контакт партнеров совершенно не одно и то же. Иногда оплодотворяющий сперматозоид не проникает в яйцеклетку в течение четырнадцати дней с момента слияния партнеров. Именно подобное оплодотворение яйцеклетки может быть названо зачатием, поскольку с момента, когда оплодотворенная яйцеклетка покидает фаллопиеву трубу, начинается период беременности. В период с первых восемнадцати дней до двадцати одного дня вся работа выполняется матерью, но в это время возрождающееся Эго, одетое в колоколообразное облако желаний и тела разума, входит в лоно матери и колоколообразное облако закрывается снизу, становясь яйцеобразным. Затем, дух уже окончательно окутывается плотью и больше не может вырваться, а должен оставаться с матерью до освобождения во время родов. На данной ступени нашего развития дух совершает очень незначительную сознательную работу над своим будущим проводником, но все время присутствует и помогает бессознательно в работе обеспечения себя инструментом. Все это не более удивительно, чем то, что мы можем переваривать пищу и использовать свои дыхательные органы, не осознавая самих этих процессов.

### <h3 id="question-7">Вопрос 7</h3>

В чем заключалась цель разделения полов?

Ответ: Разделение полов было осуществлено на очень ранней стадии эволюции человека, когда у него еще не было мозга и гортани. Половина созидательной силы была повернута вверх, чтобы могло осуществиться построение эти двух органов. Мозг был создан для эволюции мысли, чтобы посредством него человек создавал в Физическом мире. Дома, города, пароходы, железные дороги, все, что сделано руками, является кристаллизовавшейся человеческой мыслью. Гортань также была создана творческой сексуальной энергией, чтобы человек мог выражать свои мысли. Связь этих органов и силы, выраженной через низший созидательный орган, становится очевидной, если вспомнить, что у мальчика, обладающего положительной творческой силой, ломается голос в период полового созревания, когда он впервые становится способен порождать себе подобных. Человек, злоупотребляющий своей сексуальной силой, становится идиотом, в то время как мудрец, использующий почти всю свою созидательную силу для процесса мышления, вряд ли будет обладать склонностью к любовным похождениям.

До этого разделения человек был, как некоторые растения в наше время, полной творческой единицей, способной сохранять свой род без помощи другого. Способность к мышлению и речи была куплена ценой потери созидательной силы. Но теперь половина этой силы, выражаемая через мозг и гортань, может быть использована для создания вещей в этом мире — домов, кораблей и так далее.

### <h3 id="question-8">Вопрос 8</h3>

Действительно ли душа женщины мужского пола, а мужчины — женского?

Ответ: Вообще говоря, мы можем сказать «да». Жизненное тело, которое со временем трансформируется, преобразуется и одухотворяется в душу, имеет противоположный пол. Оно формируется, орган за органом, в точности, как плотное физическое тело, с этим одним-единственным исключением, что объясняет многие факты, иначе непонятные. Способности, присущие жизненному телу, следующие: развитие, воспроизведение, усвоение и память. Женщины, обладая позитивным жизненным телом, созревают раньше мужчин, и части, остающиеся подобными растениям, такие, как например, волосы, вырастают у них более длинными и пышными. И естественно, что позитивное жизненное тело вырабатывает больше крови, чем негативное жизненное тело мужчины, следовательно, давление крови у женщины больше, и его необходимо уменьшать посредством периодического оттока. Когда же в период климакса этот отток прекращается, женское тело вновь принимается расти, что хорошо отражено в выражении «сорокалетняя толстуха».

Импульсы тела желаний гонят кровь через организм с различной скоростью, в соответствии с силой эмоций. Женский организм, обладающий избытком крови, работает при намного более высоком давлении, чем мужской, и, хотя время от времени это давление сокращается за счет периодического оттока, иногда необходим дополнительный выход; в таком случае женские слезы, или белое кровотечение, действуют как предохранительный клапан для того, чтобы удалить излишнюю жидкость. Мужчины могут иметь такие же сильные эмоции, как и женщины, но реже поддаются слезам, потому что имеют лишь необходимое количество крови.

Поскольку женщина позитивно поляризована в Эфирном слое Физического мира, ее сферой проявления всегда были дом и церковь, где она окружена любовью и миром, в то время как мужчина сражался за выживание, не имея такого убежища в плотном Физическом мире, где он позитивен. И в этих битвах побеждали самые сильные и ловкие.

### <h3 id="question-9">Вопрос 9</h3>

Сохраняем ли мы тот же характер на протяжении всех жизней?

Ответ: Эго можно уподобить драгоценному камню, необработанному алмазу. Когда камень извлекают из земли, он отнюдь не красив. Грубая оболочка скрывает внутренний блеск, и, прежде чем необработанный алмаз станет драгоценным камнем, его надо отшлифовать на жестком шлифовальном камне. Каждое прикосновение к шлифовальному камню снимает часть грубого покрова и отшлифовывает грань, через которую проходит свет и преломляется под другим углом, нежели свет, отброшенный другими гранями.

Также и с Эго. Необработанным алмазом оно вступает в школу жизненного опыта, начиная странствие через материю, и каждая жизнь подобна прикосновению шлифовального камня к драгоценности. Каждая жизнь в школе опыта удаляет часть шероховатости Эго и пропускает свет разума под новым углом, давая новый жизненный опыт, и так же, как лучи света изменяются во многих гранях бриллианта, так же и характер Эго различается в разных жизнях. В каждой жизни мы можем проявить только малую часть нашей духовной природы, мы можем осознать лишь малую часть блеска наших божественных возможностей, но каждая жизнь нацелена на то, чтобы сделать нас более совершенными, а наш характер более ровным. На самом деле именно работа над характером есть основная часть нашего урока, поскольку целью является умение владеть собой. Как сказал Гете:

```
Избавиться от силы, держащей мир в цепях,  
Способен человек, смиривший сам себя.

### <h3 id="question-10">Вопрос 10</h3>

Подвержено ли тело желаний болезням, и нуждается ли оно в питании и восполнении?

Ответ: В определенном смысле нуждается — во время земной жизни. То есть болезнь проявляется в первую очередь в теле желаний и жизненном теле, ткань которых истончается и не выделяет жизненных флюидов в той пропорции, что в здоровом состоянии. Тогда заболевает плотное физическое тело. При выздоровлении высшие проводники демонстрируют улучшение прежде, чем проявление выздоровления становится очевидным в Физическом мире.

Но если ваш вопрос относился к посмертным состояниям, то дело обстоит иначе. Человек может быть больным в Физическом мире, возможно, прикованным к постели на протяжении ряда лет и неспособным передвигаться. Но когда приходит черед смерти и человек видит себя без плотного тела, мгновенно наступает чувство облегчения, счастья и легкости, непривычные для него, и он внезапно пробуждается к осознанию того, что у него нет боли и что он может перемещаться. Если он поймет, в каких условиях оказался, то он также узнает, что пища ему не нужна, так как тело желаний не нуждается в восполнении. Многие люди, однако, не осознают происходящего, и поэтому оказывается, что в нижних областях мира Желаний они продолжают заниматься привычной домашней работой. Так что рассказы некоторых исследователей-спиритуалистов, которые обнаружили подобные обстоятельства в Невидимом мире, во многом объясняют то, что Жорж дю Морье рассказывал о жизни Питера Иббетсона и графини Тауэр в своем романе, носящем имя героя. Этот роман рекомендуется читателю в качестве чудесной иллюстрации деятельности подсознательной памяти, где герой сталкивается со своей жизнью в детстве и реальными обстоятельствами в нижних областях Невидимого мира, затрагивающими его отношения с графиней.

### <h3 id="question-11">Вопрос 11</h3>

Как получается, что человек искупает все свои грехи в чистилище, а при новом рождении вынужден опять страдать по закону Причины и Следствий за грехи, совершенные в предыдущей жизни?

Ответ: В чистилище существуют два различных рода деятельности. Первый — искоренение плохих привычек. Например, пьяница страстно желает пить столько же, сколько он пил перед смертью, но теперь у него нет желудка и пищевода, чтобы вместить выпитое, поэтому он хотя и может теперь ходить по различным пивным заведениям и даже забраться внутрь бочонка с виски и пропитаться спиртным, не получает удовлетворения, так как не происходит того возбуждения, как при химической реакции в желудке. Поэтому он испытывает муки Тантала — «Вода, вода повсюду, но нет ни капли для питья».

Но как сгорает желание в этом мире, когда мы понимаем, что его невозможно удовлетворить, так со временем и пьяница излечивается в чистилище от своего желания пить, поскольку он не может получить удовольствия от выпивки. Поэтому он рождается невинным к греху, если говорить об этом конкретном пороке. Однако ему необходимо преодолеть этот порок сознательно, так что в определенное время на его пути возникнет искушение. Когда он вырастет, его приятель может предложить ему «пойти выпить». Тогда все зависит от того, поддастся он или нет. Если он поддастся, то заново согрешит и должен будет заново очищаться, пока накопленные страдания повторяющихся переживаний опыта чистилища не вызовут у него отвращения к выпивке. Тогда он сознательно преодолеет искушение и этот источник не принесет больше страданий.

Относительно зла, которое мы причинили другим, например, если мы жестоко вели себя с ребенком, находящемся на нашем попечении, если мы били его, или заставляли голодать, или как-либо иначе жестоко с ним обращались, сцены, когда мы так плохо поступали, запечатлеются на атоме в сердце. Позже эта гравировка перенесется в тело желаний, и панорама жизни, которая разворачивается в обратном порядке, опять представит эти сцены перед нашим сознанием. Мы сами будем чувствовать то же, что чувствовал ребенок, будучи нашей жертвой; мы будем чувствовать следы от порки, которую мы ему устраивали, точно так же, как их чувствовал ребенок; мы будем ощущать душевную боль и унижение; мы будем переживать мучения одно за другим, и когда мы родимся вновь, то опять встретим нашу жертву и у нас будет возможность сделать ей что-то хорошее вместо того, чтобы причинять зло. Если мы так поступим, то это правильно и хорошо; если наша старая вражда возобновится, как и раньше, то дополнительные следы от порки в следующем чистилище в конце концов заставят нас увидеть, что мы должны быть милосердны к тем, кто находится на нашем попечении. Итак, мы не страдаем заново за грехи предыдущей жизни; мы рождаемся невинными благодаря благословенной помощи чистилища, и по крайней мере каждый грех, который мы совершаем, — это выбор свободной воли. Но искушения посылаются нам, чтобы убедиться, что очищение было достаточным для выучивания необходимых уроков, и наше право — поддаться или непоколебимо и твердо стоять за добро.

### <h3 id="question-12">Вопрос 12</h3>

Совесть — это голос Бога или нашего Ангела-хранителя?

Ответ: Когда дух покидает тело в момент смерти, панорама его последней жизни проходит перед ним в течение первых трех с половиной дней после его освобождения из тела. Эти картины выгравированы в его теле желаний и составляют основу жизни в чистилище и на Первом небе, которые находятся в мире Желаний. Последняя жизнь воспроизводится в картинах, движущихся в обратном порядке, так что сцены, происшедшие непосредственно перед смертью, проходят первыми; потом жизнь движется к детству и младенчеству. В чистилище восстанавливаются только те сцены, где душа вела себя неправильно, и душа видит себя вместо того, кому она причинила зло, и страдает, как страдали те, кому она причиняла зло в земной жизни. Запись этих страданий неизгладимо запечатлевается на атоме-семени, который является единственной частью плотного тела, которую душа берет с собой и постоянно хранит от жизни к жизни. Этот атом — некоторым образом книга для Ангела-регистратора. Поскольку страдание, вызванное определенными действиями, запечатлевается в чистилище на атоме-семени человека, очевидно, что, когда в новой жизни возникают подобные обстоятельства и прежние искушения появляются перед нами, страдания, испытанные нами из-за неправильных поступков, присутствуют в атоме-семени, чтобы предостеречь нас, что такая-то линия поведения неправильна. Это — голос совести, и, если страдание, вызванное в чистилище, было достаточно сильным, у нас хватит сил противостоять любым возникающим перед нами искушениям. Если, с другой стороны, по каким-то определенным причинам страдание было недостаточно острым, мы можем постоянно или периодически поддаваться в другой жизни подобным искушениям, которые привели к страданиям в предыдущих жизнях, мы можем поддаваться им, даже несмотря на тихий шепот совести. Но, освобождаясь от своих тел и попадая в чистилище в следующий раз, мы будем испытывать там дополнительные страдания из-за того, что поддались искушению, и общий эффект этих страданий в конце концов будет достаточным, чтобы удержаться от образа действий, приносящего нам боль.

Когда перед нами появилось искушение в земной жизни и мы его сознательно отвергли, это значит, что урок выучен и совесть завершила свою работу.

Иначе отвечая на вопрос, мы можем, следовательно, сказать, что совесть — это память Духа о прошлых страданиях, вызванных ошибками в предыдущих жизнях.

### <h3 id="question-13">Вопрос 13</h3>

Что такое гениальность?

Ответ: С обычной точки зрения кажется, что гениальность — это случайность. Теория наследственности не объясняет это явление, поскольку иногда самые обычные люди приносят миру ребенка, который оказывается гением, и у высокообразованных и интеллектуальных людей дети бывают идиотами. В иных случаях мы встречаем как идиотов, так и гениев в одной семье. Действительно, безумие и гениальность, можно сказать, — две крайности, два полюса умственных способностей человека.

Если мы попытаемся объяснить гениальность с помощью наследственности, мы не сможем не задать себе вопроса, почему у Томаса Эдисона не было длинной линии предков — механиков, в которой он мог бы считаться украшением семьи. Но мы выясняем, что во всех случаях появление гения не следует ни из одного закона, если проводить рассмотрение с чисто материалистической точки зрения.

Если мы обратимся к закону Причинности и его спутнику, закону Возрождения, имеющим отношение к данному вопросу, ситуация изменится в корне. Теория, опирающаяся на эти законы, утверждает, что земная жизнь является школой опыта; что с каждым новым рождением мы появляемся с накопленным за все предыдущие жизни опытом, нашим запасом, капиталом; что многие из нас посещали эту школу опыта на протяжении многих жизней и создали большие запасы. Возможно, мы развивали какую-то определенную способность больше, чем другие, и вследствие этого стали чрезвычайно искусны в одном особенном направлении. Это гениальность.

Для того чтобы выразить некоторые из наших талантов, например музыкальный, необходимо обладать определенными физическими качествами, такими, как длинные и тонкие пальцы, утонченная нервная система; в особенности ухо должно быть специфически развито, чтобы мы могли выражать себя как музыканты. Материал, необходимый для подобного выражения, нельзя найти где угодно, но закон Притяжения естественно привлечет музыканта к другим музыкантам, и там он найдет в своем распоряжении готовые материалы для постройки тела, такого, как ему необходимо для выражения своего таланта. Поэтому иногда кажется, что музыканты рождаются только в роду музыкантов; например, в течение двухсот пятидесяти лет в семье Бахов родилось двадцать девять музыкантов.

### <h3 id="question-14">Вопрос 14</h3>

Действительно ли душа, которая рождается женщиной, всегда остается женщиной в последующих жизнях и никогда не может стать мужчиной? И сколько времени проходит между воплощениями?

Ответ: Нет, дух — двуполый и обычно выражает себя в последующих жизнях поочередно то мужчиной, то женщиной. Однако иногда бывают случаи, когда по закону Следствий предпочтительнее, чтобы на протяжении нескольких последовательных жизней дух обретал определенный пол.

Закон гласит следующее.

По мере того как Солнце перемещается в обратном направлении среди двенадцати созвездий посредством движения, называемого нами прецессией равноденствий, климат Земли, ее флора и фауна медленно меняются, таким образом создавая другое окружение для человеческой расы во время каждого последующего века. Солнцу требуется примерно две тысячи лет, чтобы пройти через знак посредством прецессии, и в течение этого времени дух обычно рождается дважды, один раз как мужчина и один раз как женщина. Изменения, происходящие за тысячу лет между воплощениями, не такие уж значительные, но их достаточно, чтобы дух мог извлечь опыт из данного окружения с позиции как мужчины, так и женщины.

Однако могут быть случаи, когда время тоже меняется. Ни один из этих законов не является жестким и непоколебимым, все они направляются великими Разумными Существами для блага человечества, поэтому условия могут быть изменены, чтобы в случае острой необходимости соответствовать индивидуальной ситуации. Например, случай с музыкантом. Он не может найти материал в любом месте, чтобы создать из него себе тело. Ему нужна определенная помощь для построения трех полукружных каналов в ухе так, чтобы они максимально точно были направлены на три стороны пространства; ему также нужна дополнительная помощь для создания тонких волокон коры головного мозга, поскольку способность различать оттенки тонов зависит от данных анатомических особенностей.

В этом случае, если семья музыкантов, с которой он связан, в состоянии родить ребенка, он может появиться там, хотя его пребывание в Небесном мире не должно было бы завершиться в течение еще сотни лет, поскольку ему может не представиться другой возможности в течение двухсот или трехсот лет после того, как ему надлежало бы родиться при условии строгого соблюдения закона. Тогда, конечно, человек оказывается впереди своего времени, и представители поколения, среди которых он живет, не могут его понять и оценить. Он не находит понимания, но это лучше, чем если бы он родился позже, чем надо, так как в этом случае он бы отстал от времени.

Итак, мы часто видим, что гении остаются непризнанными своими современниками, хотя получают высокую оценку последующих поколений, способных понять их точку зрения.

### <h3 id="question-15">Вопрос 15</h3>

Если человек оплачивает долги, заботится о своей семье и ведет высоконравственный образ жизни здесь, будет ли у него все хорошо после смерти?

Ответ: Нет, требуется кое-что еще, и немало людей с подобными взглядами ведут незавидное существование в мире Желаний после смерти. Конечно, можно судить их с точки зрения только материальной жизни, но в настоящее время от нас требуется, по меньшей мере, культивировать альтруистические тенденции, чтобы продвигаться дальше нашего нынешнего эволюционного состояния.

Люди, пренебрегшие духовными обязанностями, встречаются после смерти в четвертом слое мира Желаний. Вот бизнесмен, честный в делах, работавший для улучшения материального состояния своего города и страны, как добропорядочный гражданин платил своим работникам зарплату, предупредительно обращался со своей женой и семьей, заботясь о них, и так далее. Может быть, он даже построил церковь или, по крайней мере, делал церкви щедрые пожертвования, может быть, он построил библиотеки, основал институты. Но он не отдавал себя. Ему лишь была нужна церковь ради интересов семьи или респектабельности; он не вложил свое сердце в церковь, все его сердце было в бизнесе, зарабатывании денег или завоевании положения в свете.

Когда он попадает в мир Желаний после смерти, он слишком хорош для чистилища и недостаточно хорош для неба. Он справедливо поступал с каждым и никому не причинил зла. Поэтому ему нечего искупать. Но он не сделал и ничего такого, что могло бы обеспечить ему жизнь на Первом небе, где усваивается то благое, что он совершил во время последней жизни. Поэтому он оказывается в четвертом слое — как будто между небом и адом. Четвертый слой — центр мира Желаний, и чувства здесь наиболее интенсивны; человек ощущает страстную тягу к бизнесу, но здесь он не может ни покупать, ни продавать, и потому жизнь его ужасно монотонна.

Все, что он давал на церкви, институты и прочее, ничего не значит, потому что он не вкладывал своего сердца. Только то, что мы даем из любви, станет даром, способным принести счастье после смерти. Важно не количество, которое мы даем, важен дух, сопровождающий наш дар; поэтому во власти каждого давать и приносить пользу себе и другим. Неразборчивая раздача денег может обернуться расточительностью и бедностью, но, даря сердечное сочувствие, помогая людям обрести веру в себя и начать жизнь заново, когда они оказались на обочине жизни, отдавая себя на службу истомленному человечеству, мы собираем себе сокровища на небесах и даем больше, чем золото. Христос сказал: «Нищих всегда имеете с собою». Может быть, мы не сможем вывести их из нищеты к богатству, но, возможно, это и не самое лучшее для них. Однако мы можем поддержать их, чтобы они могли усвоить урок, который надо выучить в нищете. Мы можем помочь им обрести новый взгляд на жизнь, и, пока человек, находящийся в положении, описанном задающим вопрос, не начнет поступать именно так, у него не будет «все хорошо», когда он умрет. Он будет страдать от ужасающей скуки, чтобы научиться тому, что ему необходимо наполнять свою жизнь чем-то представляющим реальную ценность. Тогда в последующей жизни совесть станет побуждать его совершать нечто большее, чем просто вымучивать доллары, хотя он не будет пренебрегать своими имущественными обязанностями, так как это так же плохо, как и отвергать духовные устремления.

### <h3 id="question-16">Вопрос 16</h3>

Иногда высказывают спорное утверждение, будто мы имеем право думать что угодно и не ответственны за наши мысли. Так ли это с эзотерической точки зрения?

Ответ: Нет, конечно. Верно как раз обратное, и нам совершенно не нужно забираться в далекие области, обычно называемые эзотерикой. Как следует из заповеди, данной Христом в Нагорной проповеди, «всякий, кто смотрит на женщину с вожделением, уже прелюбодействовал с ней». И когда мы поймем, что, каковы мысли в душе человека, таков он и есть, у нас будет более четкое понимание жизни, нежели если мы будем брать в рассмотрение только поступки человека, поскольку каждый поступок является результатом предшествующей мысли. Но эти мысли не всегда наши собственные.

Когда мы ударяем по камертону и он начинает звучать, другой камертон того же тона, расположенный рядом, тоже будет звучать. Аналогично, если мы подумали о чем-то и другой человек из нашего окружения думал на ту же тему, наши мысли сливаются с его мыслями и усиливают их на благо или во зло в соответствии с их природой. Пьеса под названием «Час колдовства», в которой герой собирается помочь негодяю сбежать из штата Кентукки, где последний должен быть арестован за убийство губернатора, не просто фантазия. Герой — человек, обладающий немалой силой мысли, чувствует, что может руководить преступником. Он сообщает своей сестре, что непосредственно перед убийством он думал, что убийство можно совершить именно тем способом, которым оно и было совершено. Он находится под впечатлением, что мозг убийцы мог уловить его мысли, которые могли показать ему способ совершения преступления.

Когда мы становимся присяжными и видим перед собой преступника, мы рассматриваем только его действия и не имеем понятия о мыслях, руководивших им. Если бы у нас всегда была привычка думать дурно и злобно о том или другом человеке, эти мысли могли бы быть притягательны для преступника. В принципе, для насыщенного раствора соли достаточно одного-единственного кристаллика, чтобы произошло выпадение осадка. Точно так же, если человек насытил свой мозг мыслями об убийстве, посылаемая нами мысль может оказаться последней каплей, переполняющей чашу и разрушающей последнюю преграду, которая удерживала его от совершения поступка.

Поэтому наши мысли намного важнее наших поступков, так как если бы мы всегда правильно думали, то и всегда бы правильно поступали. Никто не может помышлять с любовью о своих ближних, создавая план помощи им духовно, мысленно и физически, чтобы не осуществить этих мыслей когда-нибудь в своей жизни. Если мы будем культивировать подобные мысли, то скоро обнаружим, что вокруг нас распространяется солнечное сияние; мы увидим, что люди встречают нас с тем же духовным настроем, который мы им посылаем. Если бы мы могли осознать, что тело желаний (которое окружает каждого из нас, выступая за периферию нашего физического тела примерно на восемь-девять сантиметров), содержит все эти чувства и эмоции, тогда бы мы иначе воспринимали людей, так как мы бы понимали, что смотрим на все через созданную вокруг нас атмосферу, которая окрашивает все, что мы видим в других.

Если мы видим подлость и ничтожность в людях, которых встречаем, было бы хорошо убедиться, не наша ли атмосфера, через которую мы смотрим, окрашивает их таким образом. Давайте посмотрим, нет ли у нас этих нежелательных качеств, и тогда начнем исправлять дефект у себя самих. Подлый и ничтожный человек сам излучает эти свойства, и, кого бы он ни встретил, всякий покажется ему подлым, так как он вызовет в других именно те качества, которые сам проявляет. В принципе, вибрация звучащего камертона определенного тона при ударе вызывает вибрацию другого камертона того же тона. С другой стороны, если мы культивируем спокойное отношение, свободное от страстного желания, искренность, честность и готовность к помощи, мы вызовем в других самое лучшее. Поэтому давайте осознаем, что только когда мы разовьем лучшие качества в нас самих, мы можем ожидать найти их в других. Поистине мы сами ответственны за свои мысли, мы действительно сторожа своим братьям, поскольку, как мы думаем, когда встречаемся с ними, такими мы им и являемся, и они отражают наше отношение. В соответствии с вышеприведенным принципом, если мы хотим добиться помощи для развития своих лучших качеств, нам нужно искать общества тех людей, которые уже стали хорошими, так как их умонастроения будут нам огромной поддержкой в развитии у себя лучших качеств.

### <h3 id="question-17">Вопрос 17</h3>

Если человека все время беспокоят грешные мысли, которые продолжают посещать его, хотя он постоянно с ними борется, существует ли способ для очищения ума, чтобы его наполняли только чистые и добрые мысли?

Ответ: Да, существует, и этот способ очень простой. Спрашивающий сам говорит о главной проблеме: он постоянно борется со своими мыслями. Чтобы понять суть вопроса, рассмотрим пример.

Предположим, мы испытываем постоянную неприязнь к какому-то человеку, которого мы каждый день встречаем на улице, возможно по нескольку раз. Если бы каждый раз при встрече мы останавливались и ругали его за то, что он ходит по улице, а не держится подальше, чтобы не попадаться нам на глаза, мы бы лишь подливали масла в огонь нашей вражды. Мы лишь побуждаем его к ссоре, и он исключительно назло нам может постараться попадаться нам навстречу как можно чаще. И наши пристрастия, и наши антипатии имеют склонность притягивать к нам соответствующие мысли или идеи, и дополнительная сила мысли, которую мы послали сражаться с греховными мыслями, будет поддерживать в них жизнь и чаще привлекать их в наш ум. Точно так же перебранка вынудит не нравящегося нам человека попадаться нам назло. Но если вместо того чтобы сражаться с ним, мы примем тактику безразличия, если мы будем отворачиваться от него при встрече на улице, ему скоро наскучит преследовать нас. В соответствии с этим принципом, когда греховные мысли посещают наш ум, нам лучше отвернуться с безразличием и употребить свой ум на что-нибудь хорошее и безупречное. Тогда за короткое время мы избавимся от этих мыслей, и у нас останутся только добрые мысли, которые мы стремимся принимать.

### <h3 id="question-18">Вопрос 18</h3>

Если женщина является эманацией мужчины, как повествуется в сюжете с ребром, вернется ли она в конце к единству путем обратного поглощения в мужскую божественность, потеряв свою индивидуальность?

Ответ: Сюжет с ребром — это один из примеров грубого невежества переводчиков Библии, не обладавших эзотерическими знаниями, при работе с древнееврейским языком, который при написании не был разделен на слова и не обладал огласовками. При помещении огласовок в различные положения и по-другому разделяя слова, во многих случаях можно получить различные значения того же самого текста. В данном случае имеем ситуацию, когда слово с одной огласовкой читается как «tsad», а с другой — «tsela». Переводчики Библии прочли так, что Бог взял что-то из бока Адама («tsela»), и были озадачены, что бы это могло значить. Возможно, они подумали, что наименьший вред принесло бы изъятие ребра («tsad»), отсюда этот глупый сюжет.

В действительности человек был сначала подобен Богам, «сотворен по их образу», мужчиной и женщиной, гермафродитом, и позже одна сторона была удалена, так что он оказался разделенным на два пола. Можно добавить, что первый орган, который развился до его нынешнего состояния, был женский орган, и женская сторона всегда присутствовала во всем до мужской, появившейся позже. В соответствии с законом эволюции «будут последними первые, и первые последними», так что женское начало будет сохраняться дольше как отдельный пол, чем мужское. Так что спрашивающий абсолютно не прав в своем предположении. Именно мужское начало будет поглощено женским. Уже сейчас заметно, что мужской орган постепенно уменьшается в своем основании и в конце прекратит свое существование.

Что касается потери женской индивидуальности, то подобное невозможно; цель эволюции как раз в том, чтобы мы стали индивидуальностями, самосознательными и разделенными во время эволюции, самосознательными и объединенными во время перерыва между проявлениями.

### <h3 id="question-19">Вопрос 19</h3>

Почему женщина была проклята неравенством, приняла более низкое положение и несправедливость с начала человеческого существования и до сегодняшнего уровня?

Ответ: Прежде всего мы должны помнить, что дух не имеет ни мужского, ни женского рода, но выражает себя через них и, как правило, поочередно. Все мы были и мужчинами и женщинами. Поэтому не может быть вопроса о неравенстве, если посмотреть на жизнь с более высокой точки зрения. Дух в каждом веке должен усвоить определенные уроки, которые могут быть уяснены только с позиции женщины; есть и другие уроки, которые можно выучить только при воплощении в мужское тело. Поэтому по необходимости должна быть смена полов. Иногда случается, конечно, что по некоторым причинам человек должен появляться как мужчина на протяжении нескольких воплощений, и, конечно, когда он принимает женское обличье, может возникнуть значительный конфликт. В этом случае женщина бывает мужеподобной, возможно, суфражисткой с воинственной натурой. С другой стороны, дух может иногда воплощаться несколько раз в женском обличье, и тогда может появиться мужчина с очень женственным характером, натуральная «девчонка». Приняв гипотезу о чередующихся воплощениях, можно предположить, что многие из нас, вероятно, воплощались в Риме и были противоположного пола, а обращение мужчин с женщинами в то время было не таким, чтобы согласно закону Причины и Следствий позволить римским женщинам, воплотившимся сейчас мужчинами, давать поблажки своим прежним хозяевам.

### <h3 id="question-20">Вопрос 20</h3>

Почему страдания Маргариты были столь непропорционально сильными по отношению к страданиям Фауста, вплоть до заключения в тюрьму и наказания смертью, в то время как его жизнь, свобода и поиски счастья протекали относительно безопасно?

Ответ: Данный вопрос имеет отношение к одному из мифов, пришедших к нам из древности. В противовес всеобщему мнению миф не является чем-то легким для понимания. Это — завуалированная истина, открывающая через символы великие духовные принципы. Эти мифы были даны младенческому человечеству по той же причине, по которой мы даем своим детям этические принципы в детских рассказах и книжках с картинками, которые по-настоящему поражают их детское воображение, что никогда не достигается интеллектуальными поучениями.

Гете, который был Посвященным, обработал миф о Фаусте весьма поучительным образом. Ключ к пониманию можно найти в прологе, действие которого происходит на небесах, во многом так же, как и в начале Книги Иова. Сыновья Бога предстают перед Престолом, дьявол тоже находится среди них, поскольку он — один из сынов Бога. Ему дается разрешение соблазнять Фауста, чтобы вызвать духовную активность и развить добродетель. Одна из наших больших ошибок заключается именно в том, что мы считаем синонимами невинность и добродетель. Каждый из нас рождается невинным, он приходит сюда без всякого греха, поскольку все грехи были искуплены. Но у каждого из нас есть определенные наклонности, которые могут развиться в порок. Поэтому человека надо испытывать в каждой жизни, чтобы увидеть, поддастся ли он искушению и воспримет зло или же устоит и разовьет добродетель. Фауст подвергся искушению и не устоял, но после этого он искренне раскаивается и преобразует силы зла в добро, поэтому в конце концов он спасен. Раскаяние и преобразование пред смертью обусловили его спасение, нечестивая страсть, которую он испытывал к Маргарите, уступила место его чистой любви к Елене. Маргарита также поддается соблазну, она раскаивается, и ей даруется спасение через прощение грехов. Так, в первом случае — это прощение благодаря действиям. Своей энергией, которая господствует над силами зла, Фауст строит новую землю, землю, где свободный человек может жить при лучших условиях. Он стремится поднять человечество на новый уровень, и своей деятельностью, своим бескорыстным трудом для других он освобождается от сил зла. В случае Маргариты спасение стало результатом молитвы и раскаяния. Итак, в этой драме, представленной Гете, мы имеем совершенный символ западного учения, заключающегося в том, что существует как прощение грехов, так и искупление неверного поступка правильным. Смерть — нечто, что приходит к каждому, и страдание, сопутствующее неверному поступку в каждом случае, конечно, ничуть не меньше в отношении Фауста, где оно продолжалось долгие годы, чем в отношении Маргариты, где жизнь закончилась в гораздо более короткое время. Единственное отличие в том, что Фауст победил сознательно и в будущей жизни будет невосприимчив к искушениям, в то время как случай Маргариты неясный. В будущей земной жизни она еще встретит искушение, чтобы выявить, развила ли она силу характера, требующуюся, чтобы не поддаться злу и остаться верной добру.

### <h3 id="question-21">Вопрос 21</h3>

Есть ли такое место в Ветхом или Новом Завете, где людям было сказано жениться и жить как брат с сестрой в любое время и при любых обстоятельствах? И если этого нет в Библии, почему вы этому учите?

Ответ: Прасемиты были пятой атлантической расой. Они пришли с тонущей Атлантиды, как об этом в различных вариантах рассказано в сюжете о Ное и Моисее. Они намеревались населить землю обетованную, не маленькую незначительную Палестину, а всю Землю в том виде, в котором она сейчас существует. Им было это обещано, поскольку Земля претерпевала изменения, обычные при переходе к господству новой расы. Потопы разрушили цивилизацию атлантов, и племена, составившие ядро современных арийских рас, блуждали в пустыне Гоби в Центральной Азии.

К тому моменту, когда это ядро было готово стать населяющей мир расой, рождение детей, естественно, стало делом первостепенной важности. Поэтому на данный процесс смотрели, как на долг каждого произвести множество детей и быть чрезвычайно плодовитым. Но сейчас мы живем в другое время; мир достаточно населен, и вновь воплощающиеся Эго достаточно обеспечены телами без дополнительных усилий по продолжению рода. Мы никогда не выступали за всеобщий обет безбрачия или за то, чтобы люди женились и все время жили как брат с сестрой. Но мы утверждали, что женатые люди в соответствии с их обстоятельствами должны сохранять расу. Это означает, что, если как муж, так и жена физически, духовно и умственно дееспособны, если у них есть дом, где бы воплотившееся Эго имело возможность обрести тело и получить опыт, они должны предложить себя в качестве живой жертвы на алтарь человечества и отдать вещество своих тел для обеспечения Эго проводником, приглашая его в свою семью, как они пригласили бы дорогого гостя, с благодарностью, что они способны сделать для него то, что другие сделали для них. Но когда процесс зачатия уже осуществился, они должны воздерживаться от дальнейших половых сношений, пока опять не почувствуют, что они в достаточной степени подходят для предоставления тела еще одному ребенку. В этом заключается учение розенкрейцеров относительно идеальных отношений между мужем и женой. Розенкрейцеры придерживаются мнения, что созидательная функция должна использоваться не для сексуальных целей, а лишь для поддержания расы, для чего она и была изначально задумана. Это условие идеальное и, наверное, выше возможностей большинства людей в настоящее время, равно как и предписание возлюбить врага своего; но, не имея высоких идеалов, мы не сможем развиваться.

### <h3 id="question-22">Вопрос 22</h3>

Существует ли парная душа для каждой души на протяжении всей вечности? Если это так, то не лучше ли оставаться вне брака тысячу лет, чем соединиться не с тем партнером?

Ответ: Подобно тому, как свет преломляется, разделяясь на семь цветов при прохождении сквозь атмосферу, так же и духи, выделившиеся в Боге, преломляются, образуя семь великих лучей. Каждый тип находится под непосредственным руководством и владычеством одного из семи Духов перед Престолом, Планетарных Гениев, Звездных Ангелов. Все Чистые Духи во время последовательных воплощений постоянно перемешиваются в общей массе между собой, чтобы получить как можно более разнообразный опыт. Тем не менее те из них, которые произошли от одного итого же Звездного Ангела, всегда остаются душами-сестрами или душами-близнецами, и, когда они ищут высшей жизни, им приходится вступить на путь Посвящения через ложу, образованную представителями того же Луча, из которого они изначально вышли сами, чтобы оттуда вернуться к первоисточнику. Поэтому все эзотерические школы разделяются на семь отделов, каждая для одного вида духов. По этой причине Христос говорил Своим ученикам: «Ваш отец и Мой». Никто не мог соприкоснуться с ним ближе, чем эти ученики, а также те, кто принадлежал тому же лучу.

Как и все остальные тайны, это прекрасное учение, опустившись до уровня физической, или материальной, идеи, воплотилось в общедоступную концепцию душ-близнецов или родственных душ, из которых один — мужчина, а другая — женщина, и очень часто каждый — муж другой или жена другого. В таких случаях теория душ-близнецов часто служит оправданием бегству с возлюбленным или супружеской измене. Подобное является гнусным извращением. Каждый дух самодостаточен, он выбирает для себя тело мужчины или женщины в разное время, чтобы усвоить жизненные уроки, и именно на современном этапе его развития существует фактор пола. Эго было до разделения полов и будет продолжать существовать после того, как фаза такого разделения завершится.

### <h3 id="question-23">Вопрос 23</h3>

Плохо ли заключать брак двоюродным, троюродным или четвероюродным братьям и сестрам, если да, то почему?

Ответ: Целью брака является поддержание расы; ребенок же будет соответствовать физической природе родителей, а также их окружению. Интересно, что эмигранты, прибывшие к нашим берегам, отличаются от детей, рожденных ими здесь, в Америке, а последние отличаются от детей, рожденных в Европе. Например, длинноголовые сицилийцы рождают в Америке более круглоголовых детей, а круглоголовые евреи рождают детей с более овальной формой головы. Таким образом, становится очевидным, что во всех расах существует тенденция к слиянию и рождению новой американской расы.

Эти изменения происходят неслучайно. Великие Водители человечества всегда имеют целью создать определенные условия, чтобы получить определенные типы. Только таким путем можно развить способности, необходимые для продвижения духа. Было время, когда для эволюции Эго было необходимо, чтобы люди вступали в брак внутри своего рода. В то время человечество не было так развито и индивидуализировано, как сейчас. Оно управлялось Родовыми Духами, проникавшими в кровь через воздух и вдохновлявшими Эго при контроле над его инструментом. Тогда у человечества было то, что известно под названием ясновидения, и этот тип ясновидения еще можно встретить среди тех, кто сильно упорствовал в заключении браков внутри рода, как например, высокогорные шотландцы и цыгане. 

Но было необходимо, чтобы люди на время забыли духовный мир и не знали о другой жизни, а помнили лишь о текущем моменте. Чтобы внести эти изменения в сознание, Великие Водители предприняли несколько шагов, одним из которых было запрещение внутрисемейных браков. Когда мы читаем в пятой главе Книги Бытия, что Адам жил 900 лет, а все патриархи жили столетиями, это вовсе не означает, что сами названные личности жили на протяжении названного времени. Это значит, что кровь, циркулировавшая по их венам, была напрямую передана потомками и содержала картины родового опыта, как и наша кровь содержит картины наших индивидуальных жизней, поскольку кровь — это хранилище всего опыта. Поэтому потомки патриархальных родов видели себя Адамом, Мафусаилом и так далее. Конечно, на протяжении столетий эти картины постепенно тускнели, и, когда память об Адаме исчезла из крови его прямых потомков, стали говорить, что он умер.

По мере того как человек становился более индивидуализированным, ему приходилось учиться твердо стоять на своих собственных ногах без помощи Родового Духа. Потом были разрешены и даже стали необходимыми межплеменные браки, а заключение браков внутри семьи больше не разрешалось. Это убило способность к ясновидению. Наука продемонстрировала, что, когда кровь одного животного добавляется в вены другого, происходит гемолиз, или распад крови, в результате чего низшее животное погибает. Но привнесение чужой крови, каким бы путем оно ни совершалось, всегда убивает что-то, если не форму, то по крайней мере способность. Чужая кровь, привносимая в результате брака, убила способность к ясновидению, которой обладал первобытный человек. То, что утверждение о разрушительности чужой крови верно, можно проследить на примере помесей. При спаривании лошади и осла появляется мул, но у мула отсутствует детородная способность, так как он не находится под контролем Группового Духа ни лошадей, ни ослов, и если бы он давал потомство, то появились бы особи, не контролируемые каким-либо Групповым Духом. Однако мул недостаточно развился, чтобы быть в состоянии руководить своим инструментом без помощи Группового Духа, и поскольку способность к продолжению рода отсутствует, Групповой Дух не дает атома оплодотворяющего семени. Однако в случае с человечеством все было иначе. Достигнув стадии, на которой было приказано вступать в межплеменные браки, люди подошли к той точке эволюции самосознания, когда они были способны самостоятельно управлять ладьей своей жизни. С этих пор они больше не были управляемыми Богом автоматами и стали самоуправляемыми индивидуумами. Чем больше смешана кровь, тем меньше обитающий внутри дух может управляться какими бы то ни было Расовыми или Родовыми Духами, воздействовавшими на наших предков. Таким образом, привходящим Эго предоставляются более широкие границы, если мы заключаем брак с человеком другого рода, чем когда стремимся к партнерству с родственником.

### <h3 id="question-24">Вопрос 24</h3>

Будет ли разумно для двух людей с одинаковым характером пожениться, если они родились под одним знаком зодиака? В августе, например?

Ответ: Утверждается, что каждую секунду в мире рождается один человек; тогда за час рождается 3600 человек, за 24 часа — 86400 человек и примерно два миллиона человек в месяц. Если бы всем им было суждено иметь одинаковый характер и одинаковую судьбу, существовало бы только двенадцать типов людей. Однако мы знаем, что нет двух абсолютно одинаковых людей. Поэтому глупо говорить, что у кого-то одинаковый характер, потому что они родились под одним знаком зодиака.

Научно подходя к составлению гороскопа, необходимо учесть день и год рождения человека, так как планеты занимают одинаковые положения относительно друг друга не чаще, чем один раз в двадцать пять тысяч восемьсот шестьдесят восемь лет. В дальнейшем мы должны также принять во внимание час рождения и, если возможно, попытаться установить минуты ввиду очень быстро изменяющегося положения Луны. Если также мы примем во внимание место рождения, то сможем рассчитать восходящий знак, дающий форму тела. Только тогда у нас будет абсолютно индивидуальный гороскоп, поскольку градус зодиака, восходящего над восточным горизонтом, меняется каждые четыре минуты, поэтому даже для близнецов будет некое отличие.

Поэтому, чтобы сказать, будет брак гармоничным или нет, астрологу необходимо составить гороскоп для этих двоих людей и попытаться выяснить их физическую, духовную и умственную совместимость. О физической совместимости он судит, сравнивая асценденты, или восходящие знаки. Положения Марса и Венеры покажут, одинаковые ли у них нравственные ценности, а Солнце и Луна укажут на их умственные характеристики. Итак, у астролога имеется точный критерий, чтобы оценить, подойдут ли эти люди друг другу. Предсказания, основанные на чем-то меньшем, чем подобные вычисления, неверны.

### <h3 id="question-25">Вопрос № 25</h3>

Пожалуйста, изложите взгляды оккультиста относительно смешанных браков белых рас с другими расами, а также относительно их детей.

Ответ: Человеческий дух не является ни цветным, ни белым, но на разных стадиях своего развития он использовал чёрные, жёлтые и белые тела, и автор, основываясь на определённых признаках, полагает, что следующая великая раса будет прекрасного голубого цвета. Расы — это лишь тела, используемые на время в процессе эволюции духа, так же как когда‑то мы обитали в чёрных телах. Когда мы покинули их, другие, менее развитые духи заняли тела чёрной расы. Затем мы использовали жёлтые тела. Позднее мы покинули и жёлтые тела, и в настоящее время занимаем белые. Под нашим «владением» эти различные тела развивались и становились более совершенными, но естественно, когда другие классы духов, которые не так продвинуты, как мы на Западе, вошли в оставленные нами тела, эти тела постепенно деградировали.

Эти низшие классы духов, наши более слабые братья, вынуждены брать то, что мы оставляем; поэтому мы, естественно, в определённом долгу перед ними, и брак с низшими расами необходим для создания чего‑то более высокого. Тела негров Юга, тела мулатов, метисов и октоорунов гораздо совершеннее чёрных тел негров Африки и, конечно, населены гораздо более высоким уровнем Эго, чем африканское негритянское тело; и таким образом постоянно поддерживается непрерывная лестница между первопроходцами и низшими расами. Ибо, как цветок был бы невозможен без минеральной почвы, в которой он может расти, так и белая раса с чувствительными телами и напряжёнными нервами, как на Западе, была бы невозможна, если бы мы как духи не получили опыт, приобретённый в ходе нашего продвижения через низшие расы. Долг, который мы должны тем, кто взял то, что мы оставили, должен быть погашен, и это наиболее успешно достигается путём создания промежуточных звеньев, которые соединяют пропасть между расами. В случае южного негра существуют и другие причины — национальная судьба, навлечённая нами из‑за его принудительного ввоза и последующего рабства.

### <h3 id="question-26">Вопрос 26</h3>

Почему обычно говорят, что негры отмечены проклятием Каина, если они потомки Хама, согласно библейской этнологии? Как эта раса может быть древнее, чем сыновья Сима или Иафета? Правда ли, что наиболее интеллектуальная, успешная и устойчивая раса, известная в истории, а именно евреи, единственная, что наиболее свободна от смешения?

Ответ: В Библии нигде не указано, что негры — потомки Хама; более того, хорошо известно, что библейская этнология, как она обычно понимается среди ортодоксальных людей, совершенно не соответствует фактам, подтвержденным исследованиями в области геологии и этнологии. Прошло то время, когда делались утверждения, подобные, например, заявлению декана Кембриджского университета, сделанному менее столетия назад, а именно, что мир был создан в пятницу, 10 октября 4004 года до Р.Х., в девять утра. Библейская этнология также указывает точный год потопа и подобные установленные события. Но с эзотерической точки зрения, которая получена непосредственным созерцанием картинной галереи прошлого, называемой памятью Природы, дело обстоит совершенно иначе. Мы обнаруживаем, что были различные эпохи, или великие этапы развития земной истории, и что негры были человечеством третьей из этих эпох, Лемурийской. Вся человеческая раса в то время была чернокожей. Затем пришло время, называемое Атлантической эпохой, когда человечество было красным и желтым, кроме одной расы, которая была белой. Эти люди были прасемитами, пятой атлантической расой. Эти жители Атлантиды называются в старинных преданиях нибелунгами, или детьми тумана, так как атмосфера Земли в то время была густым туманом. В конце Атлантической эпохи атмосфера сконденсировалась, произведя потопы, и постепенно море покрыло большую часть глобуса. Затем атмосфера над землей прояснилась. Этот момент эволюционного развития описан в Библии, когда Ной, вождь семитов, вышел из тонущей Атлантиды и впервые увидел радугу, явление невозможное в туманной атмосфере ранней Атлантиды. Отголоски этого великого переселения мы слышим и в рассказе о Моисее и израильтянах, вышедших из Египта, в то время как египетский фараон и его люди потонули в водах Красного моря. Эти люди были избраны стать прародителями нашей теперешней арийской расы, но не все они были верны требованиям своего руководителя. Среди них были «ходившие за иной плотию», и это величайшее преступление, возможное в то время, поскольку, когда руководитель стремится привить новые способности новой расе, примесь чужой крови может разрушить его планы. Поэтому некоторые из этих избранных были потеряны, то есть покинуты своими руководителями, и не стали предками нового человечества.

Любопытно, что именно те, кто были таким образом потеряны или оставлены позади, являются сегодняшними евреями. Когда-то они сочетались браком с семьями своих атлантических собратьев вопреки своему божественному водителю и, несмотря на это, считают себя сейчас «избранным народом» Бога. Нет сомнения, что первые евреи помнили о своем грехе, заключении браков вне своих племен, поэтому эти мятежники с того времени стали верны предписанию не заключать браков с неевреями.

Относительно того, что их раса интеллектуальна, мы говорим — НЕТ! В Полярную эпоху человек развил плотное тело, в Гиперборейскую эпоху — жизненный принцип. В Лемурийскую эпоху присоединилось тело желаний, чтобы придать стимул действию, а ум добавился в Атлантическую эпоху, дав людям хитрость. Мышление, или интеллект, — это способность, которую развивается в Арийскую эпоху, а изучение фактов покажет нам, что евреи все еще в большой степени руководствуются наработкой жителей Атлантиды — хитростью.

Руководители человечества старались заставить этих людей смешаться с другими расами, чтобы вывести их из данной ситуации. Еврейская Библия рассказывает нам, как их неоднократно изгоняли, но бесполезно; они остались обособленным народом. Христос был послан к ним как свой к своим, поскольку предполагалось, что они воспримут слово из уст человека, вышедшего из их среды, но они выбрали Варавву. Это была последняя капля, стало очевидно, что невозможно их спасти в теле. С того времени их рассеяли по всему миру, чтобы таким путем вынудить их смешаться, и они стали народом без страны, но таково упрямство этого народа, что до сих пор они все еще обособленны. Однако здесь, в Америке, в «великом плавильном котле», они медленно начинают смешиваться. Они были потеряны из-за заключения вне-родовых браков с низшей расой, но в свое время спасутся благодаря бракам с более продвинутыми расами здесь, на американском континенте.

### <h3 id="question-27">Вопрос 27</h3>

Есть ли в философии розенкрейцеров особенный раздел, касающийся воспитания детей?

Ответ: Возможно, нет более важного вопроса, чем этот. В первую очередь, мудрые родители, жаждущие дать своим детям все преимущества, начинают до рождения ребенка, даже до зачатия, молитвенно обращать свои мысли к выполнению осуществляемой ими задачи. Они начинают тщательно заботиться, чтобы соединение, которое должно принести зарождение, происходило при надлежащем влиянии светил, когда Луна проходит через знаки, соответствующие построению сильного и здорового тела. Они также содержат свои собственные тела в наилучшем физическом, духовном и умственном состоянии.

Затем во время беременности они постоянно держат перед своим мысленным взором образ насыщенной, полезной жизни для приходящего существа и как можно быстрее, сразу после рождения, составляют гороскоп для ребенка, поскольку идеальный родитель — всегда астролог. Если родители не могут сами составить гороскоп, они должны по крайней мере изучить звездные знаки, которые помогут им разумно осмыслить то, что им сообщает астрология. Но при определенных обстоятельствах они должны проконсультироваться у профессионального астролога, хотя бы им пришлось потратить некоторое время на его поиски. Из карты рождения ребенка можно с легкостью увидеть сильные и слабые стороны его характера. Тогда родители смогут воспользоваться возможностью питать добро и принимать должные меры для подавления зла, прежде чем наклонности сами собой разовьются и реализуются. Таким образом они могут в большой мере помочь приходящему существу преодолеть недостатки.

Следующее: родители должны осознать, что событие, называемое нами рождением, — это лишь явление видимого физического тела, которое рождается и приходит к данной высокой ступени своей эффективности в более короткое время, чем невидимые проводники человека, потому что за ним стоит более длительная эволюция. Как плод защищен от воздействий видимого мира, пока он заключен в защищающее лоно матери во время периода беременности, так же и более тонкие проводники заключены в оболочки эфирного вещества и вещества желаний, предохраняющие их, пока они достаточно не созреют и не смогут выдержать условия внешнего мира.

Итак, жизненное тело рождается, когда ребенку исполняется семь лет, то есть когда у него прорезаются постоянные зубы, а тело желаний рождается примерно в четырнадцатилетнем возрасте, то есть во время полового созревания. Ум рождается примерно в возрасте двадцати одного года, когда, как мы говорим, человек достигает совершеннолетия.

Существуют определенные важные моменты, о которых можно позаботиться только во время подходящего периода развития, и родитель должен их знать. Хотя органы уже сформировались к моменту рождения ребенка, линии развития определяются в первые семь лет, и если они не начертаны должным образом в течение этого времени, ребенок, который мог бы быть здоровым, может вырасти в болезненного мужчину или нездоровую женщину.

В первой главе Евангелия от Иоанна мы читаем: «В начале было Слово... и без него ничто не начало быть, что начало быть... и слово стало плотию». Слово — это ритмический звук, а звук — великий космический строитель, поэтому в начале первой семеричной эпохи своей жизни ребенок доложен быть окружен музыкой верной природы, музыкальным языком, причем колыбельные песни и убаюкивающие ритмы особенно ценны. Значение их совершенно неважно, а важен ритм. Чем больше таких ритмов будет вокруг ребенка, тем более здоровым он будет расти.

Существует два великих ключевых слова, приложимых к этому периоду жизни ребенка. Это подражание и пример. Нет в мире другого создания, так хорошо умеющего подражать, как маленький ребенок, он следует нашему примеру в малейших деталях, на которые только способен. Поэтому родители, стремящиеся хорошо воспитать своего ребенка, всегда должны быть осторожны, находясь в обществе малыша. Бесполезно учить его не обращать на что-то внимания, у ребенка отсутствуют умственная активность и здравый смысл, он может только подражать, и он не может не подражать, как вода не может не бежать с горы. Если для себя мы приготовили какое-то блюдо, сильно приправленное и зажаренное по-французски, давая в то же время ребенку другое блюдо и объясняя ему, что то, что мы едим, вредно для него, ребенок не сможет в этот момент подражать нам, но мы прививаем ему тягу к подобной пищи. Когда он вырастет и сможет удовлетворять свои вкусы, он будет делать так же. Поэтому заботливым родителям следует воздерживаться от той пищи и тех напитков, которых они не пожелали бы своим детям.

Что касается одежды, то надо отметить, что в этот период ребенок абсолютно не должен замечать свои половые органы, поэтому одежда должна быть полностью и постоянно свободной. Это особенно важно для маленьких мальчиков, так как очень часто наиболее значительные дурные привычки в дальнейшей жизни могут образоваться из-за трения о слишком тесную одежду.

Необходимо также рассмотреть вопрос наказания, это также один из важных факторов всех периодов, способный пробудить сексуальную природу, и его следует тщательно избегать. Нет ни одного настолько упрямого ребенка, на которого не действовал бы метод вознаграждения за хорошие дела и временная приостановка привилегий в качестве расплаты за непослушание. Кроме того, надо подчеркнуть, что битье прокладывает дорогу духу раболепия. Мы очень часто жалуемся, что такие-то люди развили в себе покорность, а не твердость характера и что у них не хватает воли. Очень часто это происходит из-за жестоких побоев в детстве. Пусть каждый родитель посмотрит на эту ситуацию глазами ребенка. Понравилось ли сейчас кому-нибудь из нас жить с таким человеком, власти которого нельзя было бы избежать, который был бы гораздо больше нас, и нам бы приходилось покорно выносить порку день за днем? Отбросьте физические наказания, и большая часть социального зла исчезнет за одно поколение.

Когда на седьмом году жизни ребенка рождается жизненное тело, необходимо развивать способности восприятия и памяти. Ключевые слова этого периода — авторитет и ученичество. Если бы у нас был рано развившийся ребенок, мы бы не стали стремиться подталкивать его к обучению, которое требует большой работы мышления. Одаренные дети, как правило, становятся мужчинами и женщинами с уровнем интеллекта даже ниже обычного. Ребенку надо разрешать следовать своим собственным наклонностям. Надо развивать его наблюдательность, показывать ему жизненные примеры. Пусть он увидит пьяницу и то, к чему его привел этот порок; покажите ему также хорошего человека, поставьте перед ним высокие идеалы. Научите его принимать все, что вы ему говорите, на веру, основанную на вашем авторитете, и старайтесь быть таким, чтобы он мог уважать ваш авторитет родителя и наставника. В этот период его надо подготавливать разумно использовать силу, начинающую просыпаться в нем, которая позволит ему в конце второго семилетнего периода стать способным продлевать свой род. Нельзя допустить, чтобы он собирал эти знания из нечистых источников, потому что родители уклоняются от ответственности осветить ему деликатные темы из чувства ложной скромности. 

В качестве объекта изучения можно использовать цветок, тогда со всеми детьми от мала до велика можно провести обучение в форме прекрасной сказки. Им можно рассказать, что цветы подобны семьям, абсолютно не используя ботанические термины, но при условии, что родители хотя бы немного знают элементарную ботанику. Покажите детям некоторые цветы. Расскажите: «Вот семья цветов, где все — мальчики (тычиночный цветок), а вот другой цветок, где все — девочки (пестиковый цветок). А в этом есть и девочки и мальчики (цветок и с тычинками, и с пестиками). Покажите им пыльцу на пыльнике. Скажите, что эти маленькие цветочные мальчики — совсем как мальчики в человеческих семьях; они стремятся к приключениям и хотят выйти в мир, чтобы участвовать в битве жизни, в то время как девочки (пестики) остаются дома. Покажите им пчел с мешочками для пыльцы на лапках, расскажите, как маленькие цветочные мальчики садятся на крылатых коней, подобно древним рыцарям, и отправляются искать по свету заключенную в башню принцессу (семяпочку, скрытую в пестике); как пыльца, цветочные мальчики-рыцари, прокладывают себе путь в пестике и проникают в семяпочку. Потом скажите, что это означает, что рыцарь и принцесса поженились и жили долго и счастливо и стали родителями многих маленьких цветочных мальчиков и девочек. Когда дети полностью все это поймут, они также постигнут и процесс произведения потомства в животном и в человеческом царствах, поскольку разницы нет: каждое столь же чисто, целомудренно и свято, как и остальные. А маленькие дети, воспитанные подобным образом, всегда будут испытывать почтение к созидательной функции, о которой вряд ли можно лучше рассказать по-другому.

Если ребенка готовить подобным образом, он обретает необходимую поддержку к моменту появления тела желаний в период полового созревания. Когда желания и эмоции спущены с привязи, он вступает в самый опасный период своей жизни, период горячей молодости с четырнадцати до двадцати одного года, так как в этот период тело желаний необузданно и еще не родился ум, способный служить тормозом. Этот период успешно преодолевается ребенком, воспитанным так, как здесь было указано, поскольку его родители будут для него силой и якорем, с помощью которых он сможет пройти этот трудный отрезок времени, пока он не родится полностью в возрасте двадцати одного года, когда появляется ум.

### <h3 id="question-27">Вопрос 28</h3>

Почему дети рождаются в семьях, где им не рады?

Ответ: Если подобный вопрос может иметь значение, что, к несчастью, так и есть, то он демонстрирует весьма печальное состояние общества. Прямой задачей брака является сохранение расы, и люди, не желающие иметь детей, не имеют права жениться. Каждый ребенок должен иметь право на хорошее рождение и радушный прием. Однако мы, заботливо выбирая лучших животных, предназначенных для разведения, чтобы иметь хорошее поголовье скота, обычно совсем не думаем о физической, духовной и умственной пригодности тех, кого мы выбираем в отцы или матери нашим детям. В действительности считается неделикатным, если не бестактным, вообще думать о детях. И когда они появляются, несмотря на предупредительные меры, родители часто страдают от горя. Но нельзя противоречить закону Причины и Следствий. Мельницы Бога мелют медленно, но верно и очень мелко, и, хотя могут пройти столетия, должно прийти время, когда не желавший иметь детей родитель будет сам стремиться к новому воплощению и, возможно, родится в семье, где он будет нежеланным. Возможно также, что родитель, не желавший детей в одной жизни, станет бездетным в следующей. Автору известны случаи, когда паре было даровано множество детей, которых они очень хотели и страстно любили, но все они умирали в детстве один за другим к великому горю родителей.

### <h3 id="question-29">Вопрос 29</h3>

Если дети не появляются у мужчины и женщины, которые очень хотят их иметь, есть ли способ склонить какую-нибудь душу в невидимом мире принять их приглашения воплотиться? Если условия в семье вполне благоприятны, может ли оказаться, что среди множества ждущих воплощения душ одна сочла бы условия подходящими?

Ответ: Безусловно, этот случай из числа тех, когда возможные родители когда-то в предыдущей жизни отвергли свою возможность или, может быть, предпринимали меры предохранения от беременности. Или, если их случай иной, может быть, позже их надежды осуществятся. Автор был свидетелем ситуации, когда стремящийся воплотиться дух следовал за матерью, и некто, знавший мать ранее, сказал автору, что это Эго следовало за ней еще до замужества. Замужество оказалось бездетным, однако совсем недавно пришли вести о разводе. Было очевидно, что, хотя это Эго стремилось воплотиться через мать, оно отвергало отца. Нередко нам приходится слышать о бездетных браках, но позже, когда брачный контракт расторгался и каждый из партнеров женился снова, оба становились родителями, доказывая, что каждый из них вполне мог быть родителем с физической точки зрения и что отсутствовало именно воплощающееся Эго. Поэтому следует отметить, что пока нет Эго, стремящегося воплотиться через данную супружескую пару, их усилия будут бесплодны. 

С обычной точки зрения подобное было бы невозможно, но легко видеть, что если химический состав спермы и яйцеклетки все время один и тот же, то нет причин, чтобы союз полов был продуктивным в одном случае и бесплодным в другом, если это единственные факторы. Известно, что если смешать водород и кислород в необходимых пропорциях, мы всегда получим воду. Известно и то, что вода всегда стремится вниз с горы, следовательно, все законы природы неизменны. Если бы не было нужно никакого иного фактора, кроме химической смеси спермы и яйцеклетки, результат был бы всегда. И этот неизвестный и невидимый фактор — воплощающееся Эго, которое идет только туда, куда ему нравится, и без которого не было бы результата.

Если спрашивающий будет искренне молиться Ангелу Гавриилу, который является представителем Правителя Луны на Земле и главной движущей силой в воспроизведении тел (см. Библию), то, может быть, помощь и придет. Лучшее время для такой молитвы — понедельник, на рассвете, в период от новолуния к полнолунию.

### <h3 id="question-30">Вопрос 30</h3>

Как можно объяснить тот факт, что ребенок так часто наследует дурные свойства родителей?

Ответ: Наши объяснения заключаются в том, что данный факт не имеет места. К несчастью, люди склонны считать, что они получают свои плохие качества по наследству, и обвиняют своих родителей за их недостатки, приписывая себе все добродетели. Тот факт, что мы различаем полученное по наследству и наши собственные качества, демонстрирует существование двух сторон человеческой природы: стороны формы и стороны жизни.

Человек, мыслитель, приходит сюда оснащенным ментальной и духовной природой, принадлежащей только ему, беря от родителей только материал для построения физического тела. Мы притягиваемся к определенным людям, подчиняясь действию закона Причинности и закона Ассоциативности. Тот же закон, который заставляет музыкантов искать общества друг друга в концертных залах, игроков объединяться на скачках или в бильярдных комнатах, любящих науку людей собираться в библиотеках и так далее, приводит людей с близкими наклонностями, свойствами и вкусами к рождению в такой же семье. Так, когда мы слышим, что кто-то говорит: «Да, я знаю, я расточительный, но все мои предки никогда не любили работать, у нас всегда были слуги», что демонстрирует и объясняет лишь сходство вкусов и ничего больше. Когда другой говорит: «Да, я знаю, что не привык экономить, но ничего не могу с этим поделать, это фамильная черта», мы опять видим действие закона Ассоциативности. Чем скорее мы осознаем, что вместо того чтобы оправдывать свои дурные привычки наследственностью, нам надо стремиться покорить их и вместо них развить добродетели, необходимые нам, тем лучше для нас и для мира. Мы не сочли бы действенным оправданием то, что пьяница мог бы сказать: «Я не могу не пить, все мои товарищи пьют». Мы бы рекомендовали ему немедленно покинуть их и отстаивать собственную индивидуальность. Мы бы посоветовали людям перестать прикрываться своими предками в качестве оправдания своих дурных привычек.

### <h3 id="question-31">Вопрос 31</h3>

Не правда ли, что ребенок наследует свою кровь и нервную систему от родителей? Ели да, то не будет ли он наследовать также болезни и нервные расстройства?

Ответ: У эмбриона в нижней части горла, как раз выше грудины, или грудной кости, есть железа, называемая тимусом, которая имеет самый большой размер до рождения и постепенно атрофируется по мере взросления ребенка, полностью исчезая к четырнадцати годам или до этого возраста, очень часто в ту пору, когда должным образом закончилось формирование костей. Вопрос о назначении этой железы ставил науку в тупик; было создано несколько теорий, чтобы объяснить факт ее существования. Одна из теорий предполагает, что эта железа снабжает организм материалом для производства красных кровяных телец, пока кости ребенка окончательно не сформируются, так что он сам сможет производить кровяные тельца. Эта теория верна.

В течение первых лет Эго, которому принадлежит тело ребенка, еще не овладело им полностью, и мы понимаем, что ребенок не ответствен за свои поступки, по крайней мере до семи лет и даже до четырнадцати. В течение этого времени ребенок не несет никакой правовой ответственности за свои действия. Так и должно быть, поскольку Эго, находясь в крови, может должным образом действовать только в крови собственного производства. Так как в теле ребенка запас крови обеспечивается родителями через вилочковую железу, или тимус, ребенок не является хозяином или хозяйкой самому себе. Поэтому дети нередко не говорят о себе «я» в первые годы, а отождествляют себя с семьей; это папина девочка или мамин мальчик. Маленький ребенок скажет: «Мэри хочет этого» или «Джон хочет того», но как только они достигнут периода полового созревания и начнут сами производить свои кровяные тельца, тогда мы слышим, как мальчик или девочка говорят «Я сделаю то, я сделаю так». С этого времени они начинают отстаивать свою индивидуальность и вырываться из семейной клетки.

Видя в таком случае, что кровь на период детства, как и физическое тело, наследуется от родителей, можно утверждать, что склонности к болезням также переходят, не сами болезни, а склонность к ним. После четырнадцати лет, когда пребывающее Эго начинает само производить свои собственные тельца, от него самого в большей степени зависит, проявятся эти тенденции в реальной жизни или нет.

### <h3 id="question-32">Вопрос 32</h3>

Можно ли влиять на человека во время естественного сна, как во время гипнотического, или существует разница?

Ответ: Да разница существует. Во время естественного сна Эго, облаченное в тело мысли и тело желаний, выходит из физического тела и обычно парит над телом или по крайней мере остается поблизости от него, соединенным Серебряной Цепочкой, пока жизненное тело и плотное тело отдыхают на кровати.

Тогда можно влиять на человека, внедряя в его мозг мысли и идеи, которые мы хотим ему сообщить. Тем не менее мы не можем заставить его что-то сделать или осуществить какую-то идею, кроме той, что соответствует его естественным склонностям. Невозможно приказать ему что-то сделать или заставить подчиняться так же, как это происходит в том случае, когда человек вытеснен из тела пассами гипнотизера, так как именно мозг движет мышцами. Во время естественного сна мозг человека пропитан его собственным жизненным телом, и он полностью себя контролирует. А во время гипнотического сна пассы гипнотизера вытесняют эфир, составляющий его жизненное тело, из мозга вниз к плечам жертвы, где он лежит вокруг шеи подобно воротнику свитера. Плотный мозг тогда открыт эфиру из жизненного тела гипнотизера, замещающему истинного хозяина. Итак, во время гипнотического сна у жертвы нет выбора, какие бы идеи она ни принимала или какие бы движения она ни совершала своим телом, но во время обычного сна человек остается свободной действующей силой. Действительно, метод внушения указаний во время сна многие матери найдут необыкновенно полезным в случае упрямых детей. Так, если мать будет сидеть около кроватки спящего ребенка, держа его руку, и разговаривать с ним, как она говорила бы во время бодрствования, внедряя в его мозг желаемые идеи, то вскоре она обнаружит, что в состоянии бодрствования многие из этих идей укоренились. То же самое возможно и при взаимодействии с больным или пьющим человеком. Если мать, сиделка или другие применят этот метод, они смогут вселить в человека надежду на исцеление с последующим физическим восстановлением, или же ему будет оказана помощь в овладении собой. Безусловно, этот метод можно использовать и во зло, но мы не можем умолчать о нем, поскольку верим, что добро, которое он может принести, будет гораздо больше, чем некоторые отклонения, когда введенный в заблуждение человек получит возможность использовать его недолжным образом.

### <h3 id="question-33">Вопрос 33</h3>

Что такое сновидения? Все ли они имеют значение, и как мы можем притянуть или вызвать сновидения?

Ответ: В бодрствующем состоянии различные проводники Эго: ум, тело желаний, жизненное тело и плотное тело — все расположены концентрически. Они занимают одно и то же пространство, и внешне Эго действует в физическом теле. Но ночью во время сна без сновидений Эго, облаченное в тело желаний и тело мысли, выходит, оставляя физическое и жизненное тела на постели. При этом между высшими и низшими проводниками не остается никакой связи кроме тонкой искрящейся нити, называемой Серебряной Цепочкой. Иногда бывает так, что во время очень интенсивной работы в физическом мире тело желаний сильно возбуждается и отказывается покидать низшие проводники и выводится лишь частично. Тогда связь между центрами восприятия тела желаний и центрами восприятия физического мозга частично разлаживается. Эго видит образы и сцены мира Желаний, которые сами по себе чрезвычайно фантастичны и обманчивы и передаются центрам мозга, не будучи выстроены в логическую цепочку рассудком. По этой причине нас посещают все глупые и фантастические сны.

Однако иногда случается, что, когда Эго полностью находится вне плотного тела, как во время сна без сновидений, оно видит связанное с собой событие, которое должно материализоваться, поскольку грядущие события отбрасывают свои тени вперед, и прежде чем что-то случается в физическом мире, оно уже произошло в духовных мирах. Если после пробуждения Эго удается запечатлеть в мозгу то, что оно видело, мы говорим, что это был пророческий сон о событии, которое через непродолжительное время осуществляется или которое Эго, если ему позволяет судьба, может подправить каким-либо другим действием. Например, будучи предупрежденным таким образом о несчастном случае, оно может предпринять шаги, чтобы противодействовать грозящему несчастью.

Что касается второй части вопроса, «как мы можем притянуть или вызвать сны», мы можем сказать, что, конечно, нет пользы в том, чтобы притягивать или вызывать сбивчивые или странные сны. Но есть и другие сны, появляющиеся, когда для человека приходит пора начать жить высшей жизнью. Тогда постепенно, используя определенные упражнения, он развивает способность сознательно покидать свое тело ночью или в любое другое время. В этом случае он чувствует себя абсолютно уверенно в невидимых мирах. Он может пойти, куда захочет, хотя на край земли, в мгновение ока, и по мере того как он обучается сознательно работать в этих невидимых мирах, он больше не «видит сны», но проживает другую жизнь, более полную и более реальную, чем та, которой он живет сейчас.

### <h3 id="question-34">Вопрос 34</h3>

Что такое сон, и что вынуждает тело засыпать?

Ответ: В дневное время жизненное тело усваивает бесцветные солнечные флюиды, окружающие нас и входящие через орган, называемый селезенкой. Эта жизненная энергия пропитывает все тело, и ясновидящие видят ее как бледно-розовый флюид, преобразованный после вхождения в физическое тело. Он течет по каждому нерву и, посылаясь мозговыми центрами в особенно больших количествах, движет мышцы, к которым ведут нервы.

Можно сказать, что жизненное тело построено из направленных во все стороны точек, внутрь, наружу, вверх и вниз, по всему телу, и каждая маленькая точка проходит через центр одного из химических атомов, заставляя их вибрировать с большей скоростью, чем их естественная скорость. Жизненное тело пронизывает плотное тело с рождения до смерти при любых условиях. Когда в какой-то части тела останавливается циркуляция крови, например, если прижать руку к краю стола и она «затекает», тогда, если обладать ясновидением, можно увидеть эфирную руку жизненного тела, свисающую под видимой рукой, как перчатка. При этом химические атомы руки возвращаются к медленному темпу вибрации. Если мы пошлепаем по руке, чтобы она пришла в норму, ощущение специфического покалывания, которое мы начинаем чувствовать, вызывается точками жизненного тела, которые проникают в уснувшие атомы руки и запускают повышенную вибрацию заново.

Жизненное тело покидает плотное тело подобным образом, когда человек умирает. Тонувшие люди, которых приводили в сознание, испытывали сильные мучения, вызванные проникновением эфирных точек, ощущаемых как покалывание.

В дневное время, когда солнечные флюиды поглощаются человеком в большом количестве, эти точки жизненного тела наполняются или словно надуваются жизненным флюидом, но в течение дня, по мере того как продукты распада засоряют физическое тело все больше и больше, жизненный флюид замедляет течение. Вечером наступает момент, когда точки в жизненном теле недостаточно снабжаются дающим жизнь флюидом; они съеживаются, и атомы тела в результате движутся более лениво. Поэтому Эго чувствует, что тело стало тяжелым, медлительным и усталым. В конце концов наступает момент, когда жизненное тело ощущает полный упадок и вибрации плотных атомов становятся настолько слабыми, что Эго не может более двигать телом. Оно вынуждено удалиться, чтобы его проводник смог восстановиться. Тогда мы говорим, что тело уснуло.

Однако сон не является пассивным состоянием. Если бы было иначе, у нас бы не было разницы в ощущениях утром и сон не обладал бы никаким восстанавливающим действием. Само слово восстановление подразумевает активность.

Когда здание ветшает и приходит в негодность, его необходимо обновить и реставрировать; тогда жильцы выезжают, чтобы дать рабочим свободу действий. По тем же причинам Эго покидает свои владения на ночь. Подобно тому, как рабочие трудятся над ремонтом здания, подготавливая его к новому заселению, и Эго должно поработать над своим зданием, чтобы оно стало пригодным для возвращения. И подобная работа выполняется нами ночью, хотя мы и не осознаем ее во время бодрствования. Именно посредством этой деятельности из нашего организма удаляются яды, и в результате тело свежо и энергично утром, когда в него возвращается Эго в момент просыпания.

### <h3 id="question-35">Вопрос 35</h3>

Верят ли розенкрейцеры в медикаментозное лечение, или они следуют методу лечения Христа?

Ответ: Лучшие специалисты в целом подтверждают, что медикаментозное лечение относится к эмпирической науке, что лекарства не действуют на всех одинаково и что врачам поэтому надо экспериментировать со своими пациентами. Следовательно, медикаментозное лечение не вполне удовлетворительно. Нельзя полагаться на то, что лекарства всегда выполнят необходимую работу.

Опыт показывает, что весь рогатый скот удовлетворяется поеданием травы, а все львы довольствуются мясной диетой. Но человеческое существо за счет своей индивидуальности отличается от всех других представителей своего вида. И эта особенность человеческой расы имеет своей причиной тот факт, что, тогда как все животные одного вида выражают единый Групповой Дух, направляющий отдельных животных извне, в каждом человеческом существе обитает индивидуальный внутрисущий Дух, Эго, и поэтому то, что одному человеку — во благо, другому — во вред.

Если применение лекарственных веществ предполагает учет индивидуальных особенностей, только тогда оно может действительно помогать во всех случаях, а способом выявить особенности духа, обитающего в теле пациента, является составление гороскопа, чтобы узнать, в каких случаях применение лекарства благоприятно, и давать подходящие травы в надлежащее время. Парацельс так и поступал, именно поэтому он всегда успешно излечивал пациентов; он никогда не ошибался. Некоторые применяют астрологию с этой целью и в настоящее время; автор, например, использовал астрологию для диагностики во многих случаях. Благодаря этому он всегда мог видеть кризисы в состоянии пациента, прошлые, настоящие и будущие, и таким образом принести облегчение людям, страдающим от многих заболеваний. Именно для подобных целей надо использовать астрологию, а не унижать ее предсказаниями удачи в поисках золота, поскольку подобно всем духовным наукам она должна быть использована на благо человечества бескорыстно. Если бы врачи изучили науку астрологию, им бы с легкостью удавалось диагностировать состояние своих пациентов способом, совершенно невозможным с точки зрения обычного диагноста. Некоторые врачи начинают осознавать этот факт и обнаруживать на своем опыте, что небесные тела имеют влияние на человеческий организм. Например, когда автор был в Портланде, штат Орегон, один врач рассказал ему, что заметил следующее: когда он делает операцию при растущей Луне, то есть движущейся от новолуния к полнолунию, операция всегда бывает удачной, без осложнений. С другой стороны, он заметил, что, когда обстоятельства вынуждают его делать операцию в период движения Луны от полнолуния к новолунию, всегда есть большая опасность; все подобные операции были не столь успешны, как операции, выполненные на растущей Луне.

Среди врачей существует также тенденция все больше лечить пациентов внушением, давая безобидную таблетку и сопровождая ее сильным внушением. Каждая мать, знает она о силе внушения или нет, время от времени бессознательно применяет его в отношении своего ребенка. Если малыш упадет, она может своим внушением вызвать у него либо плач, либо смех. Если она говорит своему малышу: «Ой, мой бедный малыш, ты так сильно ударился, бедная твоя головка», ребенок начнет плакать. Но если, наоборот, она показывает на пол и восклицает: «Ох, дорогой, как ты сильно ударил этот бедный пол, как это нехорошо, пожалей его!», ребенку будет очень жалко пол, который он ударил, и он совсем забудет о собственном ушибе.

Подобным образом и врач влияет на своего пациента. Преступно для врача заходить в палату к больным с мрачным выражением лица и просить пациента объявить свою последнюю волю, так как ему недолго осталось жить. Такие вещи влияют на пациента гораздо сильнее, чем думают, и подобным образом доктора убили многих из числа тех, кого могли бы спасти. С другой стороны, если врач весел и заходит в палату с улыбкой и ободряющим словом, если он назначает безболезненное лечение и делает положительное внушение, пациент способен выздороветь, в то время как иначе он мог бы поддаться болезни. Итак, внушение намного превосходит медикаментозное лечение. Вера пациента в своего врача способна творить чудеса во благо либо во зло. Именно вера была тем методом, который Христос использовал для исцеления. Если спрашивающий обратится к примерам того, как согласно Библии Христос исцелял больных, он обнаружит, что всегда возникал вопрос веры того, кто хотел исцелиться. Каждому просителю Христос говорил: «По вере вашей да будет вам».

То, что скептицизм может противодействовать даже Его возможностям, наглядно демонстрирует тот эпизод, где, как написано, Он, странствуя, пришел в свой родной город и обнаружил, что «не бывает пророк без чести, разве только в отечестве своем и в доме своем». Этот сюжет приводится в тринадцатой главе Евангелия от Матфея, а также у Марка. Важно отметить, что в последней строфе тринадцатой главы Евангелия от Матфея написано: «И не совершил там многих чудес по неверию их». Марк пишет, что из-за их скептицизма он, «только на немногих больных возложив руки, исцелил их».

Восприимчивый ум больше всего необходим для любых исследований, скептицизм же губителен для приобретения знаний. В качестве иллюстрации приведем пример того, как автор, будучи в Коламбусе, пошел на лекцию профессора Хислофа, секретаря Общества исследований психики. Предметом лекции была тема «Новые свидетельства будущей жизни». Автор был удивлен, что профессор Хислоф в своей лекции ни разу не сослался на данные, приведенные в течение последних двадцати лет в отчетах общества, к которому он принадлежит. Но объяснение пришло после лекции, когда профессор Хислоф, отвечая на вопросы, упомянул, что не верит ни во что, о чем сообщают доклады Общества. Он не верит результатам, полученным кем-либо, кроме него. Все факты, о которых он рассказывал, были получены им самим и были новыми для него. Он ожидал, что аудитория поверит ему на слово, хотя он сам отказывался верить кому-либо другому. В качестве иллюстрации действия скептицизма он неосознанно привел отличный пример, рассказав о том, что однажды он пошел к медиуму, где Ричард Хогсон, умерший, говорил через медиума, и профессор Хислоф начал задавать ему вопросы. Хотя они и были очень просты, м-р Хогсон с трудом отвечал на них. Профессор Хислоф наконец нетерпеливо воскликнул: «В чем дело? Что с тобой, Ричард, когда ты был жив, ты был достаточно расторопен? Почему ты не можешь отвечать сейчас?» «Тогда, — сказал профессор Хислоф, — пришел ответ быстрый, как молния». — «Каждый раз как я попадаю в твою ужасную атмосферу, я слабею». Профессор Хислоф не мог понять причину, но каждый, кто видел ученика перед экзаменационной комиссией, решившей, что он тупица, поймет причину, и ему станет ясно, что именно критический и скептический склад ума профессора Хислофа вызвал трудности в общении с Ричардом Хогсоном. Мы можем таким образом сказать, что верим в медикаментозное лечение, если оно используется в сочетании с астрологией и методом исцеления Христа, являющимся исцелением верой, в сочетании с силой внушения и многими другими методами целительства. Все они частично истинны, хотя, к сожалению, многие из них доведены до крайности и абсурда. В этом случае они теряют свою благую силу и становятся опасными для тех, кто в ином случае мог бы получить пользу.

### <h3 id="question-36">Вопрос 36</h3>

Поскольку мы страдаем от своих собственных действий, считаете ли вы правильным принимать лекарства для облегчения боли, если человек не безнадежно болен или умирает?

Ответ: Данный вопрос отражает весьма прискорбную позицию ума. Точно так же можно спросить, правильно ли спасаться, когда тонешь, ведь падение в воду — это тоже результат собственных действий. Конечно, нашим долгом является принять помощь вполне квалифицированного человека или попытаться разрешить проблемы, от которых мы страдаем, любым другим способом, кажущимся нам адекватным. Мы бы поступили определенно плохо, если бы позволили своему физическому инструменту разрушиться из-за недостатка надлежащей заботы и внимания. Он является нашим самым ценным инструментом, и, пока мы не научились осмотрительно его использовать и заботиться о нем, мы ответственны перед законом Причины и Следствий за свое пренебрежительное отношение к нему.

Вопрос, подобный этому, демонстрирует совершенно ошибочное понимание закона Причины и Следствий. Наш долг — попытаться подняться над обстоятельствами вместо того, чтобы позволять им управлять нашей жизнью. Это маленькое красивое стихотворение очень точно выражает данную мысль:

```
Один корабль на восток, другой на запад отплывает,  
Хоть направленья не меняет ветер.  
Отнюдь не легкий бриз их путь определяет,  
А паруса их долгую дорогу метят.  
    
Морские ветры те — судьбы нашей стези,  
Когда мы путешествуем по жизни.  
А к цели лишь душа наш бег стремит,  
А не согласие иль споры, укоризны.  
```

Если мы постараемся повернуть паруса нашей лодки жизни в правильном направлении, то всегда будем способны корректировать и даже полностью менять условия жизни, самостоятельно творить свою жизнь вместо того, чтобы сидеть праздно, ожидая, когда пройдут облака, которые мы сами создали. Сам факт, что мы сами их создали, должен вдохновить нас и придать нам отваги и энергии рассеять или оттолкнуть их как можно быстрее.

### <h3 id="question-37">Вопрос 37</h3>

Какого рода лечение вы посоветуете — у врача или у целителя, например, последователя «Христианской Науки»?

Ответ: Это зависит от природы болезни и характера пациента. Если речь идет о переломе ноги, то очевидно, что прежде всего надо обращаться к хирургу. Если наблюдается общий разлад организма и можно найти врача широкого профиля, тогда во многих случаях он именно тот, кто вам нужен. С другой стороны, если просить о помощи духовного целителя или целителя «Христианской Науки», или любого другого духовно мыслящего человека, то они смогут помочь человеку, если он сам обладает сильной верой. Подобно тому, как откликается камертон определенного тона, если ударить по другому камертону того же тона, и преисполненный веры человек откликнется на оказание помощи духовными целителями. Но там, где вера в их методы у пациента отсутствует, лучше послать за обычным врачом, к которому у пациента есть доверие, так как здоровье или болезнь полностью зависит от душевного состояния, и при условиях болезни, когда человек ослаблен, он становится сверхчувствительным и не надо перечить ему в его предпочтениях. Сверх того, какой бы хорошей ни была любая система целительства, действие на определенного человека будет полезным или вредным строго пропорционально его вере в ее исцеляющую силу.

### <h3 id="question-38">Вопрос 38</h3>

Каково выше мнение относительно голодания как способа лечения болезней?

Ответ: Можно легко убедиться, что на Западе многие скорее умрут от переедания, чем от недостатка пищи. И при таких условиях голодание в течение одного или двух дней безусловно полезно, но, как существуют обжоры и любители поесть, так же существуют и те, кто ударяются в другую крайность и голодают чрезмерно. В этом скрыта большая опасность. Лучше есть умеренно и определенные виды пищи; тогда вообще не надо будет голодать.

Изучив химический состав продуктов, мы обнаружим, что определенная пища обладает ценными свойствами для системы при определенных расстройствах, и правильно употребляемая пища в действительности — лекарство. Все цитрусовые, например, замечательные антисептики. Они чистят и дезинфицируют пищевой тракт. Таким образом, они предотвращают болезнь. Все крупы, особенно рис, обладают антитоксичным действием; они убивают болезнь и гнилостные бактерии. Таким образом, зная целебные свойства разной пищи, мы можем легко пополнять запас того, что нам необходимо для исцеления наших обычных недомоганий с помощью пищи вместо голодания.

### <h3 id="question-39">Вопрос 39</h3>

Считаете ли вы неправильным пытаться избавиться от дурной привычки, такой, например, как пьянство, с помощью гипноза?

Ответ: Абсолютно категорично — да. Если смотреть с точки зрения одной жизни, то методы, подобные предлагаемым целителями движения Эммануила, без сомнения приносят немалую пользу. Пациента усаживают в кресло, погружают в сон и делают определенные внушения. Он приходит в себя и оказывается исцеленным от своих дурных привычек; из пьяницы он превращается в уважаемого гражданина, заботящегося о своей жене и семье, и выражение его лица самое располагающее.

Но если смотреть с более глубокой, эзотерической, точки зрения, полагающей эту жизнь лишь одной из многих и рассматривающей ее по отношению к воздействию на невидимые проводники человека, то ситуация в корне меняется. Когда человек погружается в гипнотический сон, гипнотизер делает пассы вокруг него, которые приводят к удалению эфира из головы плотного тела и замене его на эфир гипнотизера. Человек тогда попадает под полную власть другого; у него нет свободной воли, и поэтому так называемые «внушения» являются на самом деле приказами, которым, не имея другого выбора, жертва должна подчиняться. Более того, когда гипнотизер выводит свой эфир и будит жертву, он не может удалить весь эфир, который он поместил в нее. Используя сравнение, можно сказать, что, подобно тому, как электрическая динамомашина намагничивается прежде, чем ее впервые начинают использовать, после чего в ней остается остаточный магнетизм, который возбуждает электромагнитные поля в динамомашине каждый раз, как ее включают, так же и небольшая часть эфира жизненного тела гипнотизера остается в продолговатом мозге жертвы и становится как бы дубинкой власти над жертвой в руках гипнотизера на протяжении всей жизни. Именно поэтому внушения, проведенные в период, следующий за пробуждением жертвы, беспрекословно выполняются.

Таким образом, жертва гипнотического целителя не преодолевает дурных привычек своими собственными силами, но оказывается еще более скованной в этом отношении, как если бы она находилась в одиночной камере. И хотя в этой жизни такой человек будет казаться хорошим гражданином, когда он вернется на Землю, у него будут те же слабости, и ему придется сражаться с ними, пока наконец он не сможет преодолеть их самостоятельно.

### <h3 id="question-40">Вопрос 40</h3>

Существуют ли способы удаления известковых веществ, образующихся в наших телах из-за неправильной диеты?

Ответ: Этот вопрос показывает, что спрашивающий обеспокоен тем, что наши тела постепенно отвердевают, начиная с детства и до старости из-за известковых веществ, содержащихся в большинстве видов пищи, которой мы питаем свои тела. Эти известковые вещества сначала откладываются на стенках артерий и вен, вызывая то, что известно медикам как артериосклероз, или затвердение артерий. Артерии маленького ребенка чрезвычайно мягкие и эластичные, как резиновая трубка, но постепенно по мере продвижения от детства и юности к зрелости и старости стенки артерий затвердевают вследствие отложений известковых веществ, оставляемых кровью. Со временем они могут стать такими же жесткими и негибкими, как деревянная трубка. Такое состояние называется затвердением артерий. Артерии становятся хрупкими и могут сломаться, вызывая кровотечение и смерть. Поэтому справедливо говорят, что возраст человека определяется состоянием его артерий. Если бы мы могли очистить артерии и капилляры от наслоений, мы бы существенно продлили жизнь и функциональную пригодность нашего тела.

С эзотерической точки зрения, конечно, неважно, живем мы или умерли, смерть означает для нас не уничтожение, но только переход сознания к другим сферам. Тем не менее, если мы провели проводник через годы неумелого детства, миновали горячую пору юности и добрались до периода свободного выбора, когда мы действительно начинаем приобретать опыт, тогда, чем дольше можем мы продлить продолжительность опыта, тем больше мы приобретем. По этой причине продление жизни тела представляет определенную ценность.

Чтобы достичь данного результата, мы должны, во-первых, выбирать пищу, менее всего содержащую засоряющие вещества, которые могут вызвать затвердевание артерий и капилляров. Коротко говоря, ими являются зеленые овощи и все фрукты. Затем необходимо стремиться искоренить засоряющие вещества, которые мы уже впитали, если это возможно, но пока еще не найдено лекарство или пища, которые гарантированно дают такой эффект. Оказалось, что электрические ванны необыкновенно полезны, но не вполне достаточны. Пахта — самый лучший фактор для искоренения отложений, следующим идет сок грейпфрута. Если принимать их постоянно и в значительных количествах, эти вещества существенно улучшат состояние отвердевших артерий.

### <h3 id="question-41">Вопрос 41</h3>

Не виновата ли природа в частых физических пороках развития в растительном и животном царствах, а также в человеческой расе, и может ли существовать совершенно здоровый и нормальный разум с сильной волей в больном и уродливом теле?

Ответ: Нам бы хотелось спросить: что вы подразумеваете под природой? Бэкон пишет, что природа и Бог отличаются лишь как отпечаток и печать. Природа — это видимый символ Бога, но мы теперь слишком склонны думать о природе в материалистическом смысле. Оборотной стороной проявления в природе являются силы, не слепые силы, а разумные. Возможно, иллюстрация поможет нам осознать свое отношение к ним.

Представим, что у нас есть материал и инструменты; мы делаем стол, а собака сидит и смотрит на нас. Собака, существо более низкого царства, видит, как мы выстругиваем и потом ставим столешницу на ножки. Собака видит постепенное появление стола, она может наблюдать процесс, не понимая назначения стола, и может не понимать, что мы задумали, создавая стол. Она просто наблюдает, смотрит, как мы работаем, и видит результаты. Предположим дальше для иллюстрации, что собака видит материалы, которые постепенно приобретают форму стола, но не видит, как мы работаем и соединяем различные детали вместе, чтобы получился стол. Тогда собака оказывается примерно в таком же положении по отношению к нам, как мы — по отношению к силам природы. То, о чем мы говорим, называя электричеством, магнетизмом, расширением пара и так далее, суть Разумные Существа, работающие невидимо для нас, когда складываются определенные условия. Природные духи строят растения из кристаллов горных пород и вместе с другими многочисленными иерархиями работают вокруг нас и рядом с нами, оставаясь невидимыми, но тем не менее занятыми созданием того, что мы называем природой.

Все они — такие же развивающиеся существа, как и мы, и тот самый факт, что они развиваются, показывает, что они несовершенны и потому способны делать ошибки, которые естественно выливаются в уродства. Итак, в ответ на заданный вопрос можно сказать, что невидимые Разумные Существа, создающие то, что мы называем природой, виновны в частых ошибках, как и мы.

Что касается второй части вопроса, может ли существовать совершенно здоровый и нормальный разум с сильной волей в больном или уродливом теле, мы можем сказать: «Да, несомненно», но, поскольку выражение этого разума зависит от эффективности своего инструмента, последний, естественно, может препятствовать должному выражению своими физическими дефектами по той же причине, по которой результативность самого искусного рабочего в большой степени зависит от состояния его инструментов.

### <h3 id="question-42">Вопрос 42</h3>

В чем заключается воздействие вакцинации с эзотерической точки зрения?

Ответ: Бактериологи обнаружили, что многие болезни вызываются микроорганизмами, которые вторгаются в наше тело, а также то, что, когда эта захватническая армия начинает производить разрушения, организм приступает к выработке антител, то есть субстанции, с помощью которой он уничтожает захватчиков. Встает вопрос, кто сильнее, агрессоры или защитники. Если антитела более многочисленны, чем агрессоры, то есть субстанция, губительная для захватчиков, вырабатывается в достаточных количествах, пациент выздоравливает. Если антитела побеждены, то есть тело не способно вырабатывать достаточное количество сыворотки, необходимой для уничтожения захватчиков, то человек становится жертвой заболевания. Далее, было обнаружено, что человек, однажды выздоровевший от определенной болезни, более не подвержен новым атакам этой болезни по той причине, что в его теле присутствует сыворотка, смертельная для возбудителей болезни, от которой он когда-то излечился.

Из вышеуказанных фактов были сделаны следующие выводы:

1\) Если здоровый человек заражается малым количеством микробов какой-либо болезни, он заболевает этой болезнью в слабой форме. Его организм может затем выработать лечебную сыворотку и таким образом стать невосприимчивым к этой болезни в будущем.

В этом заключается идея вакцинации как средства предупреждения болезни.

2\) Когда человек заболевает и не способен вырабатывать достаточное количество сыворотки, которая будет уничтожать вторгнувшиеся микроорганизмы, его жизнь можно спасти путем введения в его организм сыворотки, полученной от другого организма, уже обладающего иммунитетом.

Поскольку получить такие антитоксины, или культуры, от человека нелегко, эти микрокультуры и яды стали получать от животных. О таких методах борьбы с болезнями многое было написано как «за», так и «против». Мы не касаемся их здесь; эзотерическое видение идет глубже материальной стороны проблемы. Несомненно, были случаи, когда смерть предотвращалась с помощью вакцинации; были также случаи, когда вакцинация и антитоксины вызывали гибельные последствия, которые они вроде бы должны были предотвратить, однако мы сейчас обсуждаем другое. С эзотерической точки зрения вакцинация и применение антитоксинов, полученных с помощью процессов, применяемых в бактериологических институтах, достойна порицания. Эти методы работают за счет беспомощных животных и отравляют тело человека, создавая препятствия для Эго в использовании его инструмента.

Изучив химию питания, мы обнаружим, что природа обеспечила все необходимые лекарства, и если правильно питаться, то можно защитить себя от болезней без всякой вакцинации.

При нормальном состоянии здоровья тело усваивает намного больше солнечной энергии, чем оно может использовать. Излишек ее излучается со всей поверхности тела с большой активностью и предупреждает вторжение микроорганизмов, которым недостает силы бороться с исходящими потоками. Более того, по тому же принципу, по которому вытяжной вентилятор собирает частички пыли в комнате и выбрасывает их вон, жизненный флюид очищает тело от вредных веществ вместе с возбудителями опасных болезней. Нас не должно удивлять, что эта сила разумная, она способна отбирать вещества, которые должны быть удалены, оставляя вещества благотворные и полезные. Ученые признают этот факт избирательного осмоса. Они знают, что сито пропускает частицы вещества, которые мельче, чем отверстия сита; так, почки сохраняют жидкости, используемые телом, удаляя в то же время отходы. Подобным образом проводит фильтрацию и жизненный флюид, освобождая тело от ядов и нечистот, вырабатываемых внутри, и выводя подобные продукты из организма.

Эти эманации были названы N-излучением, или одическим флюидом. Ученые обнаружили его с помощью химических реагентов, светившихся в его присутствии. В течение процесса пищеварения это излучение ослаблено из-за того, что требуется экстремальное количество солнечной энергии для осуществления внутри тела пищевого метаболизма; это цементирующий фактор процесса усвоения. Чем с большим аппетитом мы едим, тем больше количество жизненного флюида расходуется внутри тела и тем слабее оставшееся исходящее защитное излучение. Следовательно, переедая, мы находимся в большой опасности, угрожающей со стороны армии вредных микроорганизмов.

С другой стороны, если мы едим понемногу и выбираем пищу, которая легко переваривается, то уменьшение защитного жизненного потока будет, соответственно, минимальным и наш иммунитет против болезней будет более совершенным без необходимости отравлять свое тело вакцинами.

### <h3 id="question-43">Вопрос 43</h3>

Если, как вы утверждаете, Эго обитает в крови, не является ли тогда практика переливания крови здорового больному человеку опасной? Приносит ли это вред или воздействует ли как-либо на Эго, и если, да, то как?

Ответ: В ряду самых последних открытий науки стоит гемолиз — тот факт, что введение крови из вен более высокоразвитого животного низшему виду разрушает кровь более низкоразвитого животного и вызывает его смерть. Следовательно, кровь человека, вливаемая в вены какого-либо животного, губительна. Но обнаружено, что такое переливание от человека человеку допустимо, хотя временами наблюдаются неблагоприятные результаты. 

В древние времена люди сочетались браком в пределах рода, поэтому не допускалось «ходить за иной плотию». Когда сыновья Бога женились на дочерях человеческих, это означало, что подданные одного вождя брали себе жен вне своего племени, что считалось преступлением; такие преступники могли быть изгнаны вождем и даже убиты, потому что в то время определенные качества, которыми мы сейчас обладаем, должны были еще только вырабатываться в человечестве и внедряться в общую чистую кровь в пределах рода или небольшого племени. Позднее, когда человек был поставлен в более жесткие материальные условия, были предписаны межродовые браки, и с этого времени преступлением стало считаться сочетание браком в пределах одной семьи.

Древние викинги не позволяли инородцам жениться на представителях их рода, если только те не прошли церемонию смешения крови, чтобы можно было видеть, является ли вливание чужой крови вредным для их рода или нет. Все это происходило потому, что в ранние эпохи человечество не было так индивидуализировано, как в настоящее время. Люди в большей степени находилось под властью Расового или Родового Духа, жившего в их крови, подобно тому, как Групповой Дух живет сейчас в крови животных. Позднее были предписаны межродовые и межнациональные браки, чтобы освободить человечество от этого ярма и сделать каждое отдельное Эго единственным хозяином своего тела и исключить постороннее влияние.

Наука позднее обнаружила, что кровь различных людей несет в себе различные кристаллы, так что теперь можно отличить кровь негра и кровь белого человека. Однако наступит день, когда выявятся еще большие отличия, поскольку, как существует различие кристаллов, формируемых различными расами, так существует различие в кристаллах, формируемых каждым индивидуальным человеком. Отпечатки пальцев совершенно индивидуальны, и со временем будет обнаружено, что и кровь каждого индивида уникальна. Эта уникальность уже очевидна для эзотерического исследователя, и открытие данного факта наукой лишь вопрос времени. Дело в том, что все заметнее становятся индивидуальные особенности; человек делается менее зависимым и более самодостаточным.

Изменения в крови являются наиболее важными, и со временем, став заметнее, они приведут к далекоидущим последствиям. Говорят, что «Природа геометризует», но Природа — лишь видимый символ невидимого Бога, образом и подобием которого мы являемся. Будучи созданы по Его подобию, мы тоже начинаем геометризовать и, естественно, сначала работаем с субстанцией, в которой мы, человеческие духи, Эго, имеем наибольшую силу, то есть со своей кровью.

Когда кровь проходит по артериям, которые залегают глубоко в теле, она является газообразной; но потеря ею тепла по мере приближения к поверхности тела заставляет ее частично конденсироваться; именно в такой субстанции Эго учится формировать минеральные кристаллы. В период Юпитера мы будем учиться вкладывать в них низшую форму жизненности и высаживать вовне как растениеподобные структуры. В период Венеры мы обретем способность вселять в них желание и делать их подобными животным. Наконец, в период Вулкана мы наделим их умом и будем управлять ими в качестве Расовых Духов.

В настоящее время мы находимся только в самом начале индивидуализации нашей крови. Поэтому сейчас возможно переливать кровь от одного человека другому, но не за горами день, когда это станет невозможным. Кровь белого человека будет убивать всех, чей уровень ниже, и кровь более развитого человека станет ядом для человека менее культурного. Ребенок в настоящее время на протяжении детского периода получает материал для крови из родительских запасов в вилочковой железе. Однако настанет время, когда Эго будет слишком индивидуализированным, чтобы функционировать в крови, не вырабатываемой им самостоятельно. Тогда существующий способ воспроизведения должен будет замениться другим, посредством которого Эго сможет создавать свой собственный проводник без помощи родителей.

### <h3 id="question-44">Вопрос 44</h3>

В чем причины умопомешательства?

Ответ: Ответ на этот вопрос потребует тома, но можно сказать, что с эзотерической точки зрения существует четыре класса умопомешательства.

Умопомешательство всегда обусловлено разрывом в цепи проводников между Эго и физическим телом. Этот разрыв может происходить между центрами мозга и жизненным телом, или он может случиться между жизненным телом и телом желаний, между телом желаний и умом или между умом и Эго. Разрыв может быть полным или только частичным.

Когда разрыв происходит между центрами мозга и жизненным телом или между жизненным телом и телом желаний, результатом является идиотизм. Когда разрыв происходит между телом желаний и умом, контроль захватывает сильное и импульсивное тело желаний и мы видим неистового маньяка. Когда разрыв происходит между Эго и умом, тогда ум становится правителем над другими проводниками и появляется хитроумный маньяк, который может создавать у того, кто за ним присматривает, полную уверенность в своей совершенной безвредности, вынашивая при этом дьявольский план. Затем он может внезапно показать свой разрушительный менталитет и стать причиной ужасной катастрофы.

Существует один вид умопомешательства, причину которого было бы хорошо объяснить, поскольку иногда его можно избежать. В процессе возвращения Эго из невидимого мира в новое воплощение ему показываются различные возможные воплощения. Оно видит будущую жизнь с ее знаменательными и повседневными событиями как живые картины, проходящие перед его взором. Затем ему предоставляется выбор, как правило, из нескольких жизней. В это время оно видит те уроки, которые должно получить, судьбу, которую оно создало для себя в прошлых жизнях, и ту долю этой судьбы, которую ему придется отработать в каждом из предлагаемых воплощений. Затем Эго делает свой выбор и приводится агентами Ангелов-регистраторов в ту страну и ту семью, где ему предстоит прожить свою следующую жизнь.

Панорамный обзор видится на Третьем небе, где Эго свободно от оболочек и ощущает убогость материальных обстоятельств по сравнению с духовностью. В тот момент его осведомленность несравненно выше, чем при появлении здесь, на Земле, когда оно связано плотью до невообразимой степени. Позже, после зачатия и притягивания Эго к матке матери (приблизительно на восемнадцатый день после этого события), оно вступает в контакт с эфирной матрицей своего нового физического тела, созданной Ангелами-хранителями и придающей мозгу такую конфигурацию, которая будет направлять Эго так, чтобы оно отрабатывало свою судьбу.

Теперь Эго вновь видит картины своей новой жизни подобно тому как утопающий, находясь во плоти, видит картины своей прошедшей жизни. В это время оно уже частично слепо к своей духовной природе, так что, если новая жизнь кажется тяжелой, Эго часто уклоняется от вхождения в матку и не устанавливает надлежащие соединения с мозгом. Оно может попытаться быстро выскочить обратно, в результате чего жизненное эфирное тело, вместо того чтобы стать концентрическим вокруг плотного тела, может частично выступать выше физической головы. В этом случае связь между чувствительными центрами жизненного тела и плотным телом нарушается; следствиями могут быть врожденный идиотизм, эпилепсия, пляска святого Витта и подобные нервные расстройства.

Негармоничные отношения между родителями, существующие иногда, часто являются последней каплей, которая заставляет Эго почувствовать, что оно не может войти в такую среду. Поэтому важно вновь и вновь повторять предполагаемым родителям, что в период беременности бесконечно важно поддерживать вокруг будущей матери обстановку удовлетворенности и гармонии. Ибо войти в матку — тяжелая работа для Эго; она обостряет его восприимчивость до предела, и негармоничные условия в его будущем доме, без сомнения, являются дополнительным источником дискомфорта, что может привести в итоге к вышеупомянутым ужасным последствиям.

### <h3 id="question-45">Вопрос 45</h3>

Когда душевнобольной человек умирает, будет ли он по-прежнему душевнобольным в мире Желаний?

Ответ: Это зависит от того, где произошел разрыв, так как умопомешательство — это разрыв в проводниках между Эго и физическим телом. Нарушение может произойти между Эго и телом ума, между телом ума и телом желаний, между телом желаний и жизненным телом, а также между последним и физическим телом. Если разрыв находится между плотным телом и жизненным телом или между жизненным и телом желаний, Эго будет совершенно нормальным в мире Желаний сразу же после смерти, так как тогда оно сбрасывает доставляющие страдания проводники.

Если же разрыв произошел между телом желаний и телом ума, тело желаний фактически становится необузданным и часто доставляет Эго много неприятностей во время его существования в мире Желаний, поскольку Эго, безусловно, никогда не может быть душевнобольным. Умопомешательство возникает по причине того, что у Эго нет контроля над проводниками; хуже всего, очевидно, если поврежден сам ум и Эго оказывается привязанным к личности долгое время, пока эти проводники не износятся.

<h2 id="section-2">Часть II - Жизнь после смерти</h2>

### <h3 id="question-46">Вопрос 46</h3>

Для чего надо знать о состоянии после смерти, о том, что происходит в невидимом мире, и тому подобное? Не лучше ли каждый раз быть только в одном мире? Для каждого дня хватает своих забот, зачем искать сложности?

Ответ: Если бы мы знали наверняка, что когда-то нас вынудят покинуть нашу страну и отправиться в другое место, чтобы прожить там очень много лет, прежде чем нам позволят вернуться назад, не будет ли для нас благоразумным узнать язык, обычаи и законы этой страны? Подготовившись таким образом, мы не будем чувствовать себя абсолютно чужими и сможем использовать любые возможности роста и обучения, какие только сумеем найти. Нам не придется нарушать законы этой страны и попадать в беду из-за нашего невежества, в общем, со всех точек зрения нам выгодно больше знать об этой стране.

Вышесказанное хорошо иллюстрирует наше положение по отношению к невидимым мирам. После смерти мы оказываемся там, и, если мы сейчас можем получить информацию относительно тамошних условий, это наверняка пойдет нам на пользу. Во-первых, преимущество в том, что знания избавят нас от страха смерти, так как мы никогда не боимся того, что нам известно. Во-вторых, зная о чистилище и Первом небе и овладев вечерним упражнением, когда мы просматриваем то, что случилось с нами за день в обратном порядке, мы можем прожить наше чистилище здесь и сейчас, постепенно достигая прощения грехов вместо ожидания искупления дурных поступков. И если мы используем преимущество нашего знания, ежедневно усваивая то хорошее, что мы сделали за день и устраняя зло, мы будем жить с таким отношением, которого бы мы не достигли, пока не вступили бы в будущие жизни. Итак, мы сможем миновать чистилище и Первое небо сразу после смерти.

Зная, чего мы хотим достичь на Втором небе, мы можем более разумно взяться там за работу. Мы приобретаем большую уверенность по отношению в этой области, ежедневно знакомясь с ней. Так различными путями мы готовимся к тому, чтобы стать невидимыми помощниками, дабы жить все время сознательно и сократить свою эволюцию на миллионы лет.

### <h3 id="question-47">Вопрос 47</h3>

Есть ли какое-либо ограничение времени земной жизни, налагаемое до того, как мы родились?

Ответ: Да, во время вхождения Эго в возрождение оно формирует творческий архетип своей физической формы на Втором небе с помощью Творческих Иерархий. Этот архетип — звучащее, вибрирующее творение, которое Эго заставляет вибрировать с определенной силой, соответствующей длине жизни на Земле, и, пока этот архетип продолжает вибрировать, форма, построенная из химических элементов Земли, будет жить.

Однако верховным арбитром того, как должна быть прожита жизнь, является закон Причины и Следствий. Согласно этому закону в различные периоды земной жизни перед Эго возникают определенные возможности духовного роста. Если эти возможности используются, жизнь продолжается по прямому пути, а если нет, то она, можно сказать, отклоняется и приходит в тупик, где прерывается Творческими Иерархиями, разрушающими архетип в небесном мире. Итак, мы можем сказать, что наибольшая продолжительность жизни на Земле определяется до нашего физического рождения, но она может быть сокращена, если мы пренебрегаем определенными возможностями. В немногих случаях, когда жизнь была прожита совершенно и очень наполненно, когда человек старался во всех случаях использовать свои возможности, существует возможность дополнительного насыщения жизнью его архетипа, и тогда жизнь может продлиться дольше положенного срока, но, как сказано, только в исключительных случаях.

### <h3 id="question-48">Вопрос 48</h3>

Можно ли сократить время между смертью и новым рождением и таким образом ускорить свою эволюцию, и если да, то как?

Ответ: Да, это возможно для каждого, кто возьмет на себя заботу проводить просмотр этой жизни каждый день в обратном порядке от вечера к утру, осуждая себя за неправильные поступки, обещая себе исправить свои ошибки и прикладывая к этому все свое старание. Если человек делает это, он искореняет свои грехи, которые совершил за всю жизнь, и неуклонно становится лучше, чем те мужчины и женщины, которые не выполняют этого простого упражнения. Тогда грехи, которые пришлось бы иначе искупать в чистилище, уже искуплены во время жизни, поэтому существование в чистилище будет сильно сокращено. Если во время вечерних упражнений человек просматривает то хорошее, что он сделал, обещая поступать в будущем даже лучше, он усваивает добро, совершенное за день, и поэтому делает большие шаги в росте души, вследствие чего избежит в свое время необходимости жизни на Первом небе. Такой человек определенно прокладывает дорогу к Посвящению. Тогда он действительно оказывается вне сферы действия обычных законов, управляющих человечеством, и ему будет дана возможность вернуться на Землю в этом качестве гораздо быстрее, чем в ином случае.

### <h3 id="question-49">Вопрос 49</h3>

Существуют ли времена года и существует ли время, века и эпохи в других мирах?

Ответ: Нет. Мы можем сказать, что там существует один длинный день. Там нет времени, поскольку именно вращение Земли вокруг своей оси и орбитальное вращение вокруг Солнца создают время. Эти движения создают день и ночь, лето и зиму, жару и холод и так далее, так как непрозрачность Земли и ее твердый состав делают ее непроницаемой для световых лучей и испускаемого Солнцем тепла, и часть Земли всегда остается на время холодной и темной. Но в другом мире нет ничего непрозрачного и твердого, поэтому там нет ни холодного, ни горячего, ни зимы, ни лета, там нет света, нет ночи, но есть лишь один длинный яркий день.

Поэтому мы часто обнаруживаем, что те, кто ушел, умер, но полностью помнит свою последнюю земную жизнь, теряют чувство времени после смерти и могут иногда задавать вопросы относительно промежутка времени, прошедшего с момента этого события.

Там есть только один способ измерять время, и он используется обученными ясновидящими для установления событий, когда они читают в памяти Природы; это астрологический способ, опирающийся на определение положения звезд. Конечно, если то, что ищет ясновидящий, произошло в исторические времена, можно с легкостью определить год события, если обратить внимание на какое-нибудь историческое событие, которое произошло в это же время. Например, если он хочет определить время атлантических потопов, он должен особенно точно использовать прецессию, являющуюся обратным движением Солнца по двенадцати знакам зодиака, движение, при котором требуется примерно двадцать шесть тысяч лет, чтобы Солнце один раз сделало круг. Он может определить время атлантических потопов, сосчитав, сколько таких периодов по двадцать шесть тысяч лет прошло между первым и вторым, вторым и третьим потопом, а потом годы с этого момента до нашего времени. Если он несведущ в звездной науке, он не сможет этого сделать, и это еще одна причина, по которой тому, кто изучает эзотерику, следует ознакомиться с астрономией.

### <h3 id="question-50">Вопрос 50</h3>

Может ли заживо погребенный человек начать осознавать свое состояние? И как дух возвращается обратно в тело, лежащее в могиле?

Ответ: По изменению положения трупов в гробах становится очевидно, что, когда тело хоронят прежде, чем дух окончательно его покинул, дух возвращается в тело и движет телом в мучительных попытках получить необходимый воздух. И конечно, это доказывает, что сознание возвращается в тело. Для духа, конечно, твердая природа Земли и гроб не является препятствием для прихода и ухода. Дух так же легко проходит сквозь стену или другие непрозрачные или плотные препятствия, как мы проходим сквозь воздух.

### <h3 id="question-51">Вопрос 51</h3>

Почему умирают дети?

Ответ: Существует много причин для смерти детей. Мы приведем несколько основных. Во-первых, когда Эго возвращается к земной жизни, оно притягивается к определенной семье, потому что там оно оказывается в той среде, которая может обеспечить его дальнейший прогресс, и где оно может изжить часть судьбы, созданной им в предыдущих жизнях. Но если родители производят столь радикальные изменения в своей судьбе, что Эго не может получить необходимый опыт или изжить судьбу, оно обычно выводится и посылается в другое место, где может получить подходящие условия для роста в это время. Или оно выводится на несколько лет и возрождается в той же семье, если становится очевидным, что нужные условия там могут быть созданы немного позже. Но бывает, что причина детской смерти кроется в далеком прошлом, а именно в предыдущих жизнях, и, чтобы понять эту причину, надо знать, что происходит в момент смерти и сразу после нее.

Когда дух покидает тело, он забирает с собой тело желаний, тело ума и жизненное тело. Жизненное тело является хранилищем картин последней жизни. Потом они запечатлеваются в теле желаний в течение трех с половиной дней, следующих сразу за смертью. Затем содержание тела желаний определяет судьбу человека в чистилище и на Первом небе. Боль, возникающая при искуплении греха, и радость, возникающая от созерцания добра, совершенного в жизни, переносятся в другую жизнь как совесть, чтобы удерживать человека от повторения ошибок прошлых жизней и способствовать еще большему совершению им таких поступков, которые принесли ему радость в прошлой жизни.

Если родственники умирающего человека, присутствующие в той же комнате, горько рыдают в то время, когда дух покидает тело, и продолжают рыдать в течение нескольких дней, дух, который в этот период находится в очень тесном контакте с Физическим миром, будет очень расстроен горем близких и не сможет тщательно сконцентрировать свое внимание на созерцании своей прошедшей жизни. Поэтому запечатление, происходящее в тело желаний, не будет столь глубоким, как могло бы быть, если бы уходящий дух остался в тишине и покое. Следовательно, страдания в чистилище не будут столь острыми, а наслаждение на Первом небе не будет столь большим, как могло бы быть. Поэтому, когда Эго возвращается к земной жизни, оно теряет определенную часть опыта предыдущей жизни. То есть голос совести не будет звучать с той силой, с какой звучал бы в случае, если бы Эго не беспокоили плачем.

Чтобы компенсировать эту потерю, Эго обычно рождается среди тех же близких, которые плакали над ним. Затем его забирают у них еще в детском возрасте. Оно вступает в мир Желаний, но, конечно, маленький ребенок не совершал никаких грехов, которые требуют очищения, поэтому его тело желаний и тело ума остаются незатронутыми. И он идет прямо на Первое небо, чтобы ожидать нового воплощения, но это ожидание используется для того, чтобы напрямую учить его действию различных эмоций, как плохих, так и хороших. Часто он встречается с родственником, который берет ответственность за обучение его тому, что он упустил, когда этот родственник давал волю своим рыданиям; бывает, что его обучают другие. В любом случае потеря компенсируется с избытком, поэтому, когда ребенок возвратится к следующему рождению, он духовно вырастет не меньше, чем это могло быть при обычных обстоятельствах, если бы не было плача во время его ухода.

### <h3 id="question-52">Вопрос 52</h3>

В чем причина высокой смертности в младенчестве и в детстве?

Ответ: Когда человек умирает, он забирает с собой тело ума, тело желаний и жизненное тело, последнее является хранилищем картин его последней жизни. И на протяжении трех с половиной дней после смерти эти картины запечатлеваются в теле желаний, чтобы создать основу жизни человека в чистилище и на Первом небе, где искореняется зло и усваивается добро. Сам опыт жизни забывается, как мы забываем процесс обучения письму, сохраняя способность к нему. Так совокупный экстракт самого ценного из всего его опыта как во время прошлой земной жизни, так и последнего существования в чистилище и на различных небесах запоминается человеком и образует его запас при следующем рождении. Боль, которую он испытывал, говорит с ним голосом совести, добро, которое он совершил, делает его характер более альтруистическим.

Теперь, когда три с половиной дня, следующие сразу за смертью, проведены человеком в условиях тишины и покоя, он гораздо лучше может сконцентрироваться на запечатлении прошедшей жизни, и отпечаток на теле желаний будет более глубоким, чем в ситуации, когда его беспокоят истерические всхлипывания его родственников или другие причины. Тогда он более глубоко испытает хорошее и плохое в чистилище и на Первом небе, и в его последующих жизнях это острое чувство будет отчетливо присутствовать. Но если плач родственников отвлекает его внимание, или человек умирает в результате несчастного случая, возможно на людной улице, во время крушения поезда, при пожаре в театре или других горестных обстоятельствах, безусловно у него может не быть возможности надлежащим образом сконцентрироваться; также невозможно сконцентрироваться на поле битвы, если жизнь оставляется там. И все же было бы несправедливо, если бы он потерял опыт своей жизни из-за такой тяжелой смерти, поэтому закон Причины и Следствий предоставляет ему компенсацию. 

При появлении ребенка на свет часто думают, что вот он родился и все. Но подобно тому, как в период вынашивания плотное тело защищено от воздействия внешнего мира, так как находится в защищающем лоне матери, пока не достигнет достаточной зрелости, чтобы соприкоснуться с внешними условиями, так же и жизненное тело и тело ума проходят состояние вынашивания и рождаются позже, потому что их эволюция не такая длинная, как эволюция плотного тела, и им требуется больше времени для достижения зрелости, чтобы произошла индивидуализация. Жизненное тело рождается в семилетнем возрасте, когда отмечается наступление периода интенсивного роста. Тело желаний рождается во время полового созревания, в четырнадцать лет, а тело ума — в двадцать один год, когда ребенок, как говорят, становится мужчиной или женщиной, достигает совершеннолетия.

Что не ожило, не может умереть. Поэтому, если ребенок умирает прежде, чем рождается тело желаний, он отправляется в невидимый мир на Первое небо. Он не может подняться на Второе и Третье небо, так как тело ума и тело желаний не родились и не будут умирать. Итак, он просто ждет на Первом небе новой возможности воплотиться. Если он умер в предыдущей жизни при вышеупомянутых горестных обстоятельствах, в результате несчастного случая или на поле битвы, или если плач родственников сделал невозможным получение такого глубокого впечатления от совершенного им зла и содеянного добра, как в случае смерти в спокойной обстановке, сообщается, что, когда он умирает в следующей жизни ребенком под воздействием сильных чувств и желаний, он усваивает уроки, которые должен был бы выучить в чистилище, если бы его не беспокоили в момент смерти. Тогда он возрождается с совестью, развитой надлежащим образом, и может продолжить свою эволюцию.

Безусловно, детская смертность должна быть сейчас очень высокой, так как в прошлом человек был чрезвычайно воинственным и по своему невежеству совершенно невнимательным к умершим родственникам, устраивая поминки по умершим в постели, число которых было очень небольшим по сравнению с теми, кто умирал на поле битвы. Но поскольку человечество приходит к лучшему пониманию и осознает, что лучше всего нам быть сторожем брату своему во время его смерти и что мы можем ему несказанно помочь, если будем сохранять тишину и преисполнимся молитвой. Тогда детская смертность начнет сокращаться и уменьшится по сравнению с ее нынешними масштабами.

Воздействует ли как-нибудь кремация плотного тела после смерти на дух?

Ответ: В течение жизни и в состоянии бодрствующего сознания проводники Эго находятся вместе и расположены концентрически. Но во время смерти Эго, одетое телом ума и телом желаний, удаляется из плотного тела, и, поскольку жизненные функции заканчиваются, жизненное тело удаляется из плотного тела, оставляя его безжизненным в постели. Удаляется один маленький атом из сердца, а остальное тело распадается. Но при этом происходит очень важный процесс, и тем, кто находится у смертного ложа, ожидая ухода духа, следует быть очень осторожным, чтобы в комнате и во всем доме царила полная тишина, так как картины всей жизни, которые хранились в жизненном теле, проходят перед взором духа в медленной и упорядоченной последовательности в обратном порядке от смерти к рождению. Панорама прошлой жизни длится от нескольких часов до трех с половиной дней. Длительность этого периода зависит от силы жизненного тела, определяющей, сколько человек может бодрствовать в самом сильном напряжении. Некоторые люди могут работать по пятьдесят, шестьдесят и семьдесят часов, прежде чем упадут без сил, в то время как другие способны сохранять сознание только несколько часов. Причина, по которой в доме умершего должно быть тихо в течение трех с половиной дней, непосредственно следующих за смертью, заключается в следующем: В течение этого времени панорама прошлой жизни запечатлевается в тело желаний, которое будет проводником человека, пока он остается в чистилище и на Первом небе, где он пожинает добро или зло, которые он посеял, соответственно своим поступкам, совершенным в теле.

Теперь, если жизнь была наполнена событиями и жизненное тело человека сильное, на формирование отпечатка в теле желаний уйдет больше времени, чем при слабом жизненном теле, но на протяжении всего этого времени плотное тело соединено с высшими проводниками Серебряной Цепочкой, и любой вред, причиненный плотному телу, в большой степени ощущается духом. Так что бальзамирование, посмертные исследования и кремация — все это ощущается. Поэтому со всеми этими процедурами следует подождать в течение первых трех с половиной дней после смерти. Когда панорама будет полностью запечатлена в теле желаний, Серебряная Цепочка разорвется и жизненное тело притянется обратно к плотному; связи с духом больше не будет, дух освободится и сможет перейти к высшей жизни.

Когда тело похоронено, жизненное тело медленно разлагается одновременно с плотным телом, так что когда, например, рука сгнивает в могиле, эфирная рука жизненного тела, витающая над могилой, также исчезает, и так далее, пока последняя частица тела не исчезнет. Но если производят кремацию, жизненное тело уничтожается сразу. Поскольку же оно является хранилищем картин прошлой жизни, которые отпечатываются в теле желаний, чтобы создать основу жизни в чистилище и на Первом небе, преждевременная кремация до истечения трех с половиной дней является огромным несчастьем. Если не оказывается помощь, уходящий дух не может соединить тонкие тела вместе. Данная работа является частью работы, выполняемой невидимыми помощниками человечества. Иногда им помогают духи природы и другие существа, назначенные Творческими Иерархиями или Водителями человечества. Кроме того, потери происходят, если кремация осуществляется до того, как Серебряная Цепочка разорвется естественным образом. Отпечаток на теле желаний никогда не бывает столь глубоким, каким мог бы быть при правильном ходе событий, и это сильно воздействует на будущую жизнь, так как, чем глубже отпечаток прошлой жизни на теле желаний, тем в чистилище сильнее страдание за совершенное зло, а на Первом небе ярче наслаждение, являющееся следствием добрых дел прошлой жизни. Именно боль и наслаждение наших прошлых жизней создают то, что мы называем совестью. Поэтому, лишаясь части заслуженных страданий, мы теряем также осознание причиненного нами вреда, которое будет удерживать нас в будущих жизнях от повторений тех же ошибок опять и опять. Поэтому следствия преждевременной кремации являются весьма далеко идущими. Грустно сознавать, что, обладая научным подходом к рождению, с акушерками, обученными медицинскими сестрами, антисептиками и всем, что только нужно для поддержки и благополучия маленького пришельца, у нас, как ни печально, отсутствует наука смерти, чтобы помогать нам заботиться о друзьях, уходящих из нашей жизни.

### <h3 id="question-54">Вопрос 54</h3>

Если человек потерял свою память в результате нервного шока или жара, оказывает ли это воздействие на его жизненное тело и не мешает ли записи его жизни в первые три дня сразу после смерти?

Ответ: Нет. Существует память трех видов: во-первых, запись, сделанная нашими ощущениями. Мы смотрим на мир вокруг нас, мы видим и слышим. Эти впечатления отпечатаны в клетках мозга, и мы можем сознательно вспоминать, правда, не всегда и не во всем, так как этот вид памяти очень ненадежный и капризный. И если бы этот способ получения записи нашей жизни был единственным, закон Причины и Следствий оказался бы несостоятельным и наша последующая жизнь не была бы следствием того, что мы совершали или оставили несделанным в прошлом. 

Должна существовать еще одна память. Это то, что ученые называют подсознательной памятью. Как эфир переносит в фотоаппарат запись изображения окружающего пейзажа и отпечатывает его на чувствительной пластине в мельчайших подробностях, независимо от того, заметил ли эти детали фотограф или нет, точно так же этот же самый эфир, который переносит картину в наш глаз и запечатлевает ее на сетчатке, переносит в наши легкие подобную картину, которая поглощается нашей кровью. Когда кровь проходит через сердце, эта запись неизгладимо заносится на чувствительное атом-семя, расположенное в левой четверти сердца ближе к верху. Силы этого атома-семени извлекаются духом во время смерти. Они содержат запись всей жизни в мельчайших подробностях, так что независимо от того, заметили ли мы данные детали определенной сцены или нет, они тем не менее запечатлеваются там.

Жорж дю Морье написал рассказ «Питер Иббетсон», который ярко иллюстрирует теорию подсознательной памяти. Питер Иббетсон, заключенный исправительного дома, научился тому, как «правильно мечтать», то есть как, принимая определенное положение тела, перекрывать внутри себя эфирные течения, чтобы ночью по своей воле переживать любую сцену своей прошлой жизни. Тогда он мог видеть себя одновременно в роли зрителя (взрослого человека, каким он был) и участника, рядом со своими родителями и друзьями, в том окружении, которое имелось, когда эта сцена разыгрывалась. Он видел всю сцену с большим количеством деталей, чем мог заметить тогда, когда происходило это событие в материальном мире, так как при тех обстоятельствах он не мог связаться со своей подсознательной памятью. Он не мог получить информацию относительно будущего, но прошлое было вписано в записную книжку его сердца и потому достигалось им при определенных условиях. Именно из этой подсознательной памяти берется после смерти запись жизни, и, поскольку она зависит только от одного дыхания, она продолжается независимо от всех остальных обстоятельств, пока в теле есть жизнь. Хотя человек может потерять свою сознательную память и не будет способен по своему желанию вспоминать прошлые события, подсознательная память содержит их все и в нужное время раскроет.

### <h3 id="question-55">Вопрос 55</h3>

Если бесплотный дух может проходить сквозь стену, может ли он также проходить через гору и Землю и может ли он увидеть, что там внутри?

Ответ: Это зависит от того, какой бесплотный дух подразумевает спрашивающий. Когда человек умирает, он представляет собой почти то же самое, что было раньше, только теперь у него нет плотного тела. Поэтому для него вполне возможно пройти и сквозь стену, и сквозь гору. Но он не может пройти сквозь Землю.

Хорошо известно, что, хотя большинство ясновидящих и обычных медиумов могут многое поведать о достопримечательностях и обстановке мира Желаний, у нас очень мало информации о том, что существует внутри Земли. Обычные ясновидящие рассказывают, что если пытаться проникнуть внутрь Земли, то впечатление такое, будто тебя с силой бросают на стену. Это происходит потому, что Земля является телом Великого Духа, а к святая святых Великого Духа можно приблизиться только путем Посвящения. Существует девять уровней различной плотности внутри Земли вокруг ядра, которое образует как бы десятый уровень, и малые Мистерии являются вратами, ведущими в сокровенное ядро. Есть девять ступеней малых Мистерий, и на каждой ступени у кандидата появляется возможность проникнуть на соответствующий уровень Земли, а десятое малое посвящение относится к великим Мистериям, где существует уже четыре подразделения. Первое великое Посвящение учит всему тому, что может узнать человек в период Земли; второе великое Посвящение дает знания, которые могут быть получены всем человечеством к концу периода Юпитера; третье великое Посвящение даст мудрость, которую обретет человечество к концу периода Венеры, а четвертое завершит его эволюцию в данной схеме. У посвященного будет такой же статус, как и у человечества к концу периода Вулкана. И тогда он будет знать все, что заключено в этом воплощении Земли и будущих проявлениях. Малые Мистерии предоставят ему уроки эволюции, которые он прошел за три периода, предшествовавшие нынешнему периоду Земли. Эти тайны, скрывающиеся внутри Земли, останутся тайнами, пока человек сам надлежащим образом не откроет дверь. Поэтому ни один дух, воплощенный или невоплощенный, не увидит, что внутри Земли, пока врата Посвящения не откроют его скрытые способности.

### <h3 id="question-56">Вопрос 56</h3>

Встречаем ли мы после смерти своих любимых, даже если они придерживались другой веры или, возможно, были атеистами?

Ответ: Да, мы, безусловно, встречаем и узнаем их, так как смерть не обладает трансформирующей силой. Человек предстает точно таким, каким был здесь, поскольку воспринимает себя в том же образе; место нашей встречи, конечно, зависит от нескольких факторов.

Во-первых, если мы вели истинно религиозную жизнь, то сразу минуем чистилище и очень короткое время проводим на Первом небе, проходя почти напрямую на Второе небо. И если тот, кого мы любили, в соответствии со своим характером должен будет долго оставаться в мире Желаний, тогда, конечно, мы не увидимся, пока он не попадет на Второе небо. Если мы умираем вскоре за нашим другом, встреча, возможно, не произойдет в течение двадцати лет; но это не будет иметь для нас значения, так как в этих областях человек совершенно не осознает времени.

Если наш друг был материалистически мыслящим человеком и прожил высоконравственную жизнь, он будет, как это обычно происходит с подобными людьми, оставаться в четвертом слое мира Желаний определенное число лет в соответствии с длиной прожитой жизни. Затем он проследует на Второе небо, хотя там у него не будет столь полного и идеального сознания, как у человека, жившего духовными реалиями жизни.

Мы увидим и узнаем его и будем общаться с ним на протяжении столетий в работе над будущим окружением, и там он уже совсем не будет мыслить материалистически, ибо, когда дух оказывается в высокой области, он уже неподвластен иллюзиям, которые иногда окутывают его здесь, в материальном мире. Каждый осознает себя как духовное существо и вспоминает о земной жизни, как о дурном сне. После того как дух вошел в этот мир, он в любом случае пробуждается к своей истинной природе.

### <h3 id="question-57">Вопрос 57</h3>

Узнаем ли мы своих любимых, ушедших вратами смерти?

Ответ: Да, конечно. Когда человек покидает свое тело, он остается в точности таким же, каким был раньше. Нет никакой разницы, кроме того, что у него нет физического тела. Он видит себя в мире Желаний, и, поскольку он удерживает в сознании свое земное изображение, его тело желаний мгновенно принимает образ, которым обладало физические тело, поэтому каждый, кто знал его в земной жизни, узнает его, оказавшись в жизни загробной. Более того, можно добавить, что смерть не обладает преобразующей, трансформирующей силой — человек умственно и морально остается таким же, каким и был. Мы часто слышим, что те, кто кого-то любил, говорят о дорогом человеке, называя умершего ангелом, хотя они считали, что здесь, в земной жизни, он был больше похож на дьявола. Обычно считается непочтительным отзываться о нем подобным образом после смерти. Но тем не менее в действительности только тот, кто был хорошим здесь, остается хорошим там.

### <h3 id="question-58">Вопрос 58</h3>

Остается ли в чистилище человек, совершивший самоубийство, дольше, чем люди, умершие своей смертью?

Ответ: Когда Эго спускается, чтобы возродиться, оно проходит через Второе небо. Там Творческие Иерархии помогают ему построить архетип его грядущего тела. Эго закладывает в этот архетип жизнь, которая будет продолжаться определенное число лет. Эти архетипы являются полостями, обладающими звучанием, вибрационным движением, которое притягивает материал Физического мира внутрь и заставляет все атомы в теле вибрировать в тон с маленьким атомом в сердце, называемым атомом-семенем, которое, как камертон, задает высоту звука всему остальному материалу тела. К тому моменту, когда прожита вся жизнь на Земле, вибрации в архетипе прекращаются, атом-семя удаляется, плотное тело разлагается, а тело желаний, в котором Эго функционирует в чистилище и на Первом небе, принимает образ физического тела. Тогда человек начинает работу по искоренению дурных привычек и дел в чистилище и усвоение на Первом небе всего хорошего из своей прожитой жизни.

Выше описаны обычные условия, когда не нарушается естественный ход вещей, но случай самоубийства иной. Он забирает атом-семя, но полый архетип продолжает вибрировать. Поэтому человек чувствует себя опустошенным, будто его кто-то гложет изнутри; это ощущение лучше всего можно уподобить мукам страшного голода. Материал для постройки плотного тела весь находится вокруг него, но он сознает, что у него нет эталонного атома-семени, чтобы впитать это вещество и использовать его для постройки тела. Столь страшное опустошающее чувство длится так же долго, как длилась бы обычная жизнь. Так закон Причины и Следствий учит его, что нельзя прогуливать уроки жизни и что подобный поступок не остается безнаказанным. Затем, в следующей жизни, когда трудности будут постоянно встречаться на его пути, он вспомнит о страданиях прошлого, явившихся результатом самоубийства, и преодолеет их, получив опыт, способствующий росту его души.

### <h3 id="question-59">Вопрос 59</h3>

Должен ли хороший человек пройти сквозь чистилище и ощутить все зло, которое там есть, прежде чем он сможет попасть на Первое, Второе и Третье небо? И если это так, то не будет ли это незаслуженным наказанием для него?

Ответ: Спрашивающему лучше расстаться с идеей наказания. Не существует такой вещи, как наказание. Все, что случается с человеком, происходит вследствие неизменных, постоянных законов. Не существует личного Бога, раздающего подходящие с его точки зрения награды и наказания в соответствии с непостижимой волей или любым другим подобным методом. Когда Эго облачается в тела или снимает с себя свои проводники, все происходит по тому же самому принципу или по тем же самым законам, которые управляют, например, планетой. Когда планета образуется из центрального огненного тумана, на полюсах, где движение наиболее слабое, происходит кристаллизация. Кристаллизованное вещество выбрасывается центробежными силами и летит в космос, так как оно тяжелее остального огненного тумана. По аналогичным причинам, когда наиболее плотное из тел духа становится столь кристаллизованным и тяжелым, что дух больше не может его использовать для обретения опыта, процесс удаления проводников осуществляется благодаря центробежной силе, которая, естественно, первым выбрасывает плотное тело. Этот процесс мы называем смертью. Затем на некоторое время дух освобождается, но самое грубое вещество желаний, которое служило воплощением самых низких страстей и желаний, тоже должно быть выброшено. Именно насильственный выброс низких желаний вызывает боль в чистилище, где центробежная сила отталкивания сильнее всего. Если у человека есть какое-либо грубое вещество в теле желаний, он, естественно, вынужден будет остаться в чистилище и пройти процесс очищения прежде, чем сможет попасть на Первое небо. Там центростремительная сила притяжения уносит все хорошее, что было в жизни, внутрь к духовному центру, где оно усваивается как сила души, полезная для использования духом в следующей земной жизни в качестве совести. Итак, наше пребывание в чистилище зависит от того, сколько грубого вещества желаний есть в человеке, и у хорошего человека, естественно, будет очень мало или вообще не будет подобного вещества. Поэтому нам не придется говорить о его жизни в чистилище; он непосредственно проследует через эти области в Небесный мир.

### <h3 id="question-60">Вопрос 60</h3>

Что происходит с жертвой убийства или несчастного случая, повлекшего за собой смерть?

Ответ: Не существует такого понятия, как несчастный случай, по крайней мере там, где дело заканчивается смертью. Максимальная длина жизни любого человека обычно определяется до рождения, но существуют определенные моменты в жизни, когда происходит как бы разветвление путей, где перед человеком предстают определенные возможности для роста, которые он может использовать или не использовать. Если он не воспользуется своими возможностями, жизнь как бы заходит в тупик и вскоре заканчивается.

Однако подобное редко приводит к несчастному случаю, хотя могут существовать причины, по которым было бы желательно изгнать человека из его тела насильственным путем. Он ставится в те же условия, что и все остальные, когда приходится умирать, и начинает немедленно получать свой опыт в чистилище.

Ситуация с жертвой убийства, как и в случае самоубийства, иная. Благодаря своей божественной природе, человек является единственным существом, способным нарушить план своего развития: он может закончить свою жизнь по собственной воле и может прервать жизнь своего ближнего прежде, чем придет время. Страдания самоубийцы будут аналогичны страданиям убитого, так как архетип его тела будет продолжать собирать материал, который он не сможет усвоить. Но в случае убийства вторжение других действующих сил предотвращает страдания, и он будет плавать в своем теле желаний в состоянии комы до конца времени, которое он бы прожил нормальным путем. Если убийца предстает перед правосудием и, как говорят, получает высшую меру наказания, магнетическое притяжение соединит его со своей жертвой, которая постоянно будет находиться у него перед глазами. Это гораздо более тяжелое наказание, чем любое, которое мы можем ему определить, но жертва ничего не будет знать о присутствии своего убийцы.

### <h3 id="question-61">Вопрос 61</h3>

Где находится небо?

Ответ: Христос говорил: «Царствие Божие внутрь вас есть», и все же нам показано, что в тот момент, когда Он оставил своих учеников, Он взошел на небо. Чтобы это понять, нам надо проанализировать состав планеты, и, в соответствии с герметической аксиомой «Как вверху, так и внизу», мы поймем лучше, если сначала проанализируем состав человека.

Во-первых, у человека есть плотное тело, которое мы видим глазами, но это плотное тело не такое твердое, как кажется; оно пронизано несколькими невидимыми проводниками. Оно состоит из твердых веществ, жидкостей и газов химического слоя, которые, как говорит наука, пронизаны эфиром, так как тело человека не отличается от всех других предметов в мире. Наука утверждает, и это правильно, что в самом плотном твердом веществе и в самом разреженном газе каждый маленький атом вибрирует в море эфира. Этот эфир все еще физическое вещество; определенное количество его усваивается человеком и образует точную копию плотного тела, выступающую приметно на три с половиной сантиметра за контуры видимого тела. Именно эту часть взвесили врачи Бостонского университета, положив умирающего человека на весы. Они заметили, что с последним дыханием нечто, обладающее весом, покинуло тело, и чаша весов с гирями совершенно внезапно опустилась. Репортеры газет заявили, что врачи взвесили душу, но то, что они взвесили на самом деле, было состоящим из эфира жизненным телом, которое покидает тело во время смерти.

У нас есть еще более тонкий проводник, называемый телом желаний, состоящий из того, что эзотерики называют веществом желаний. Человек с развитым шестым чувством может увидеть его как яйцеобразное облако, окутывающее плотное тело со всех сторон, так что последнее находится в центре тела желаний, как желток в центре яйца, с той только разницей, что белок окружает желток, но не пронизывает его. Тело желаний пронизывает каждый атом жизненного тела и плотного тела. В структуре человека есть еще более тонкий материал, который можно назвать «веществом ума», состоящий из самого грубого материала мира мысли, материала, из которого мы образуем свои конкретные мысли. И в этот материал облечено внутрисущее Эго.

Мир устроен подобным образом. Кроме наблюдаемого нами непосредственно видимого мира, состоящего из твердых веществ, жидкостей и газов и пронизанного эфиром, существует мир Желаний, заполняющий каждую часть Физического мира и выходящий в пространство за пределы как воздуха, так и эфира. Затем есть мир Мысли, который тоже пронизывает каждую часть нашей планеты от центра до периферии и выходит в пространство еще дальше, чем любой другой мир.

Во время земной жизни человек живет на твердой, видимой Земле, но после смерти в соответствии с деяниями, совершенными в теле, он может быть все еще заключенным здесь, так как области чистилища находятся везде, вокруг и около нас, а также внизу, во внутренних, укромных частях Земли. Первое небо в определенном смысле также находится здесь, в той мере, в которой подобный материал, составляющий его, находится вокруг и около нас, но Первое небо само по себе, то место, где обычно обитают освобожденные духи, располагается вне нашей атмосферы. Несомненно, можно сказать, что Второе небо также находится внутри, так как материал, его составляющий, есть и здесь, и находящиеся на этом уровне духи могут навещать нас, хотя здешние условия, мысленные потоки и прочие условия мало подходят для их работы и развития. Поэтому они предпочитают держаться как можно дальше, в части, наиболее удаленной от центра планеты, где чистое вещество ума не загрязняется нашими эгоистичными и вредоносными потоками мысли.

Третье небо является местом, где очень немногие люди на нынешней стадии развития сохраняют какое-либо сознание, потому что большинство из нас направляется в своей мыслительной активности скорее эмоциями и чувствами, относящимися к конкретным вещам, чем абстрактной мыслью, свойственной исключительно Третьему миру. Когда мы думаем о любви, мы обычно думаем о любви в связи с каким-то человеком, а это конкретная мысль. Но думать о Любви в абстрактном смысле способны очень немногие из нас. Мы можем думать о доме, о животном и так далее, они конкретны, но нам не нравится думать об абстрактных проблемах, например о том, что квадрат гипотенузы равен сумме квадратов катетов. Поэтому большинство из нас сохраняют очень мало сознания в Третьем мире, а, следовательно, и очень мало материала этого мира входит в состав нашей планеты.

### <h3 id="question-62">Вопрос 62</h3>

Говорят, что на небе нет печали, но, если мы встречаем своих любимых, а потом расстаемся с ними, не вызывает ли это расставание по крайней мере ощущение недовольства?

Ответ: Нет, не вызывает, так как там мы видим все как есть. Здесь мы слепы. Когда Эго приходит в Физический мир, это в известном смысле причина для радости, и мы радуемся рождению ребенка, так как этот мир дает нам опыт и материал для роста души. Но если посмотреть на это событие с другой точки зрения, когда Эго приходит в этот мир и вступает в тюрьму плотного тела, радость можно вообразить лишь с большим трудом. А радоваться, когда рождается ребенок, и стенать, когда смерть освобождает его, в действительности все равно что предаваться радости, когда друга приговаривают к тюремному заключению, и давать волю истерическому плачу, когда его освобождают.

Когда дух уходит в Небесный мир, он встречается на Первом небе с некоторыми из числа тех, с кем он был связан в земной жизни. Но там он стал уже намного духовнее и ближе к истине и знает, что смерти нет. Поэтому, когда кто-то уходит дальше, возникает радость и удовольствие от продвижения вверх дорогого нам существа, а знание того, что мы встретимся вновь, непременно уничтожит всякую боль, которую могли бы испытывать оставшиеся.

### <h3 id="question-63">Вопрос 63</h3>

Объясните, пожалуйста, как надо концентрироваться, чтобы помочь тем, кто в другом мире? Подразумеваете ли вы, что надо сидеть в тишине и посылать им любовь и ободряющие мысли?

Ответ: Способность посылать мысль и силу так, чтобы эта мысль смогла достичь цели, к которой ее послали, зависит от точности, с которой думающий может визуализировать то, чего он хочет достичь. Обычные эзотерические школы, особенно те, которые следуют восточным учениям, советуют следовать методу концентрации, при котором мысли концентрируются на одной точке. Подобно тому, как лучи солнца соединяются в фокус увеличительным стеклом и при этом их силы умножаются, становясь способными зажечь огонь, так и мысль неизменно достигает своей цели, если сконцентрирована с достаточной интенсивностью.

Однако нужна длительная практика, чтобы этому научиться. На Западе очень немногие люди способны подобным образом направлять свои мысли к какой-либо цели. Западная религия, учитывая эту особенность, учит другому методу, гораздо более эффективному, чем концентрация, а именно молитве.

Поэтому, если мы хотим помочь тем, кто покинул тело, мы можем искренне молиться за их благополучие и за то, чтобы они добросовестно выучили свои уроки в чистилище и на Первом небе. Таким образом мы сможем достичь гораздо большего, чем если мы будем использовать холодный рациональный метод концентрации. Положение тела иногда сильно влияет на интенсивность молитвы, и, если кажется, что коленопреклоненная поза усиливает воздействие, следует ее принять. С другой стороны, как сказал Эмерсон:
  
    Если даже ты ни разу не молился,  
    В небесах видны твои желанья,  
    На добро и зло, к которым ты стремился,  
    Жизнь ответит должным воздаяньем.  
  
Итак, положение тела во время совершения молитвы, казалось бы несущественное, увеличивает ее интенсивность, а именно интенсивность делает молитву эффективной.

### <h3 id="question-64">Вопрос 64</h3>

Продолжают ли те, кто ушел из земной жизни, наблюдать за нами, оставшимися; например, присматривают ли матери за своими маленькими детьми или даже за более старшими?

Ответ: Да, очень часто мать, которая недавно умерла, долго наблюдает за своим маленьким ребенком. Были зарегистрированы примеры, когда матери спасали своих детей от опасности. Хотя они осознанно не понимали, как нужно материализоваться, но любовь к малышам и сильный страх за их безопасность приводили в подобных случаях к тому, что к ним притягивался материал и они становились видимыми для своих малышей. Те, кого мы называем мертвыми, обычно не уходят из дома, в котором они жили, на протяжении довольно длительного времени после похорон. Они остаются в знакомых комнатах и движутся среди нас, хотя мы их не видим. Конечно, когда наступает час отправиться на Первое небо, они уходят из наших домов, но очень часто навещают их. Когда в свое время они попадают на Второе небо, они уже больше не ощущают физическую сферу в смысле обладания домами или друзьями или родственниками, и тогда, на данный момент, их следует воспринимать скорее как природные силы, так как они работают для Земли и человечества абсолютно так же, как силы природы, не использующие человеческое воплощение.

Итак, абсолютно верно, что они долго наблюдают за своими любимыми после своего ухода, и очень часто люди, присутствующие при смерти матери, дети которой умерли, возможно, за несколько лет до того, оказываются свидетелями того, что перед смертью она видит детей около своей постели и восклицает: «О, вот Джонни, каким же большим мальчиком он стал!» и так далее. Вероятно, стоящие вокруг люди думают, что у нее галлюцинации, но у нее нет галлюцинаций; надо отметить, что видения всегда сопровождаются определенными явлениями, а именно, когда человек умирает, появляется темнота, которая, как ему кажется, спускается на него. Многие люди умирают, больше не видя Физического мира. Происходит сдвиг от световых колебаний к колебаниям мира Желаний, и это подобно тьме, распространившейся на Земле во время распятия. У кого-то происходит так, что темнота возникает не сразу, и человек становится ясновидящим, наблюдая и данный мир, и мир Желаний, в котором, конечно, появляются наши любимые, привлеченные грядущей смертью, которая является рождением в их мир.

Итак, можно сказать, что наши любимые заинтересованы в нашем благополучии еще долгое время после своего ухода, но надо помнить, что у смерти нет трансформирующей силы. Смерть не дает им никакой особенной способности заботиться о нас, и они лишены возможности действительно влиять на наши дела, так что неправильно видеть в них своих Ангелов-хранителей. Они в основном являются заинтересованными зрителями, кроме нескольких особых случаев, когда сильная любовь позволяет им оказать некоторое содействие в случае острой нужды. Эта помощь, однако, никогда не может способствовать нашему обогащению или чему-нибудь подобному, а по большей части имеет характер предупреждения об опасности или вроде того.

<h2 id="section-3">Часть III - Возрождение</h2>

### <h3 id="question-65">Вопрос 65</h3>

Почему за незначительным исключением все мы перевоплощаемся, не имея ни малейшего представления о предыдущем существовании и, таким образом не зная, отчего страдаем в этой жизни за проступки какой-то предыдущей жизни, о которых нам сейчас абсолютно ничего не известно? Не могли бы мы лучше и быстрее продвигаться духовно, если бы знали, где ошибались раньше и какие действия нам надо исправить, чтобы продвинуться вперед?

Ответ: Одним из величайших благословений для человека является то, что он не знает о своем опыте, полученном ранее, до тех пор, пока не достигнет значительного духовного развития. Это происходит потому, что в наших прошлых жизнях (когда мы были гораздо более невежественны, чем теперь) есть много темных дел, требующих расплаты, и судьба, связанная с ними, изживается постепенно. Поэтому, если бы мы знали о своих прошлых жизнях, если бы мы знали, как и когда закон Причины и Следствий потребует воздаяния за прошлые преступления, мы бы видели это как надвигающееся несчастье, нависающее над нами. Страх за себя мог бы лишить нас силы противостоять судьбе, и к моменту появления роковых событий мы бы оказались беспомощными, в полном смятении.

С другой стороны, не зная, что осталось позади, мы не можем узнать то, что впереди. Поэтому мы усваиваем уроки, и при этом страх не лишает нас нашей силы. Кроме того, для тех, кто хочет знать, существуют определенные способы узнать, какие уроки нам надо усвоить и как лучше всего это сделать. Например, наша совесть говорит нам, что именно надо или не надо делать. Если мы позаботились изучить астрологию, то гороскоп рассказывает нам о наших целях и линиях наименьшего сопротивления, чтобы, работая с этими законами природы, мы могли быстро продвигаться. Чем в большей степени мы следуем требованиям совести, тем больше мы познаем законы природы, запечатленные в астрологии, и тем быстрее подготавливаемся для получения чистого знания.

В «Зенони» Бульвера Литтона рассказывается об ужасном призраке, которого встретил Глиндон, когда преждевременно пытался взойти на следующую ступень развития. Этот призрак называется в эзотерике Стражем Порога. В промежутке между смертью и новым рождением этот Страж Порога не виден человеку, но он является воплощением всех наших прошлый дурных поступков, и его необходимо пройти каждому, кто хочет сознательно проникнуть во внутренние миры и достичь полного знания о тамошних условиях существования. Но есть еще один Страж, являющийся воплощением всех наших хороших дел; можно сказать, что он наш Ангел-хранитель.

Если нам хватит смелости миновать страшного Стража, который является первым, так как он образовался из грубого вещества желаний, мы вскоре получим сознательную помощь другого, и тогда у нас будет сила, чтобы выстоять средь бури поношений, которая обрушивается на всякого, кто пытается встать на путь бескорыстия. Но пока мы не минуем этого призрака, мы не готовы воспринимать знания о наших предыдущих жизнях; мы должны довольствоваться обычным видением, данным человечеству.

### <h3 id="question-66">Вопрос 66</h3>

Являются ли человеческие существа, населяющие Землю в настоящее время, душами, которые уже жили на Земле раньше, или новые души постоянно создаются?

Ответ: Вхождение духов в человеческие тела, созданные в том виде, какие они есть в настоящее время, началось на стадии затвердевания мира, известной как Лемурийская эпоха, и не было полностью завершено до середины Атлантической эпохи. Этот период времени занял, возможно, миллионы лет. Но с этого времени вхождения больше не было. Дверь окончательно закрыта, так как теперь мы продвинулись в своем развитии настолько далеко, что те, кто не достиг стадии, на которой они сейчас могли бы управлять человеческими телами, слишком бы сильно отстали, чтобы успевать за нашим дальнейшим развитием. С этого времени воплощенные в человеческие тела духи развивались путем повторяющихся воплощений так, что каждое без исключения человеческое существо, живущее сейчас на Земле, воплощалось несколько раз в разном окружении.

### <h3 id="question-67">Вопрос 67</h3>

Как мы можем знать наверняка, что возрождение действительно существует? Не может ли быть так, что те, кто так утверждает, страдают галлюцинациями?

Ответ: Обученный ясновидящий, способный читать в памяти Природы, может проследить жизни людей от их нынешнего состояния в обратном порядке сквозь годы детства. Он увидит их младенчество, проследует через период беременности к тому моменту, когда дух вошел в лоно матери. Он может пойти назад, видя их жизнь на небе, жизнь в чистилище, достичь момента смерти в предыдущей жизни и, двигаясь затем в обратном порядке, увидеть всю жизнь. В случае взрослых промежутки времени исчисляются тысячелетиями и более, и, конечно, если нет других способов проверки, возможно, что это галлюцинации. Однако в случае смерти детей, не достигших полового созревания, интервалы между воплощениями относительно короткие. В таких случаях легко проверить повторное воплощение ребенка среди его собственных родственников, и такая проверка входит в обучение ученика Старшими Братьями. Ему показывают ребенка, который вот-вот умрет, и поручают проследить за этим ребенком в невидимом мире на протяжении, возможно, одного года или двух лет, следуя за ним шаг за шагом, пока он не воплотится вновь, возможно, у тех же самых или у других родителей. Когда ученик таким образом сопровождает Эго через невидимые миры от одной смерти до следующего рождения, он убеждается наверняка, что закон Возрождения реально действует в природе, и у него появляется возможность в других своих исследованиях заниматься подобным изучением прошлых жизней многих индивидуумов.

И все же не является ли это ясновидение, которое он считает методом исследования, на самом деле галлюцинацией? Разве не может быть, что он при всей своей честности оказался жертвой несбыточных мечтаний? В ответ на подобное предположение можно утверждать, что каждый день в его распоряжении есть способы проверки собственных наблюдений. Если человек побывал в Нью-Йорке и увидел город, у него никогда не возникнет желание сказать: «Интересно, не ошибся ли я?» Он был там и знает это.

Так же и с ясновидящим. В то время, когда он покидает тело, он встречается и работает с людьми, которых он не знает в обычной жизни. Позже его могут пригласить навестить этих друзей из невидимых миров, он может поехать, используя их ясновидческие указания, в город, в котором он никогда не был, он может найти их на улице и в доме, увиденном благодаря ясновидению, узнать их и быть узнанным ими. Он может разговаривать с этими друзьями о том, что они делали, и о том, где они были в своих невидимых телах, и, если у него когда-либо и возникало сомнение в реальности своей жизни вне плотного физического мира, он тогда сразу и навсегда убедится в истинности своего опыта вне тела. Он знает, что они ему знакомы, он знает, что не мог быть околдован, и что его жизнь, его работа и его опыт там так же реальны, как его жизнь, работа и опыт здесь.

### <h3 id="question-68">Вопрос 68</h3>

Возвращаются ли души, прошедшие чистилище, Первое, Второе и Третье небо, сюда, чтобы опять воплотиться на Земле, или они уходят в иные сферы?

Ответ: Они опять приходят на Землю, пока не усвоят уроки, которые можно здесь выучить. Это, по существу, тот же принцип, который мы используем, когда отправляем ребенка в школу. Мы не отправляем его на один день в детский сад, на другой день в начальную школу и в колледж — на третий. Мы посылаем его в детский сад день за днем долгое время, пока он не выучит все уроки, которые он должен там усвоить. Знания, полученные в детском саду, образуют основу для того, что он должен изучить в начальной школе. В свою очередь, знания начальной школы так же являются основанием для уроков в высшей школе и колледже. Подобным образом мы учили уроки при разных обстоятельствах в прошлом, и в будущем, когда мы выучим все, что только можно выучить в нынешнем земном окружении, мы тоже обнаружим поджидающие нас задачи высшей эволюции. Прогресс бесконечен, так как мы божественны, как наш Отец Небесный, и ограничения невозможны.

### <h3 id="question-69">Вопрос 69</h3>

Встречаемся ли мы с друзьями по предыдущей жизни, когда опять рождаемся для новой земной жизни?

Ответ: У закона Возрождения в качестве парного закона есть закон Причинности. Очевидно, есть немало ситуаций, в которых мы участвуем, которые не будут иметь следствий в этой жизни. Например, муж болен, и жена ухаживает за ним с огромным самопожертвованием. Очевидно, что это долг, и, если болезнь закончится смертью мужа, в этой жизни у него не будет возможности проявить благодарность. Но если мы знаем, в чем заключаются законы природы и как они действуют, мы поймем, что они не нарушаются такой малостью, как прекращение жизни в данном теле. Если мы повреждаем конечность, она не излечится на следующий день, хотя мы можем спать ночью, не сознавая свою травму; но, когда мы пробуждаемся, повреждение примерно в том же состоянии, что и накануне. Так же и с тем, что мы совершаем в теле за одну жизнь. Хотя, пройдя период между смертью и новым рождением, мы сейчас и не осознаем предшествующие жизни, тем не менее, когда мы вступаем в новую жизнь, закон Притяжения и порожденные в предыдущей жизни причины приведут нас в новое окружение, где мы встретим своих старых друзей и старых врагов. Мы тоже знаем их, хотя, возможно не отдаем себе в этом отчет. Иногда, однако, мы встречаем человека впервые и притягиваемся к этому человеку; мы чувствуем, что знали этого человека все свои жизни и что всем своим существом можем доверять ему. Так происходит, потому что внутренний дух видит старого друга и узнает его, хотя и не может запечатлеть это узнавание в мозге, которым он сейчас обладает. Или мы можем встретить человека и почувствовать, что нам не очень бы хотелось быть с ним в одной компании, он нам инстинктивно не нравится, хотя у нас нет на это причин с обычной точки зрения; и это тоже узнавание духа, который, прокладывая мостик в прошлое, видит давнишнего врага. Так нас направляют наши инстинктивные симпатии и антипатии, продиктованные предыдущим опытом, и обычно оказывается, что в свете последующего опыта на них можно положиться.

### <h3 id="question-70">Вопрос 70</h3>

Регистрируется ли отдельно опыт, полученный в каждом воплощении, и добавляется ли к предыдущему, так что в конце дух будет полностью обладать всей суммой накопленного опыта, или опыт одной жизни более или менее бессознательно усваивается в последующем воплощении, так что приобретается лишь общее впечатление?

Ответ: Будучи детьми, мы учились писать и совершали много неловких движений прежде, чем окончательно отшлифовали эту способность. За прошедшие годы мы забыли свои переживания при обучении, но наше умение осталось, чтобы мы могли его использовать в любое требуемое время. Подобным образом человек обычно забывает опыт, полученный в разных жизнях, но развитые им способности остаются, и он может их использовать в любое время. Так, иногда можно встретить человека, никогда не бравшего уроков рисования, но в то же время являющегося настоящим художником, способным написать прекраснейшие картины. Он перенес из прошлых жизней способность, которую может сейчас использовать. Когда мы слышим, что Моцарт в три года мог сочинять музыку, это тоже говорит о накоплении чувства гармонии в прошлом. Итак, можно сказать, хотя мы этого и не помним, у нас всегда есть способности, развитые в наших прошлых жизнях для использования в настоящем. Именно это отличает одного человека от другого, тупицу от мудреца.

Но, кроме того, в природе существует запись о наших прошлых жизнях в мельчайших подробностях. Обученный ясновидящий, способный читать в памяти Природы, может проследить жизни человека в обратном порядке, как на пленке фильма, раскручиваемой назад. Сначала он увидит жизнь человека в настоящем, его рождение, его временное пребывание в невидимом мире, потом смерть в предшествующей жизни, которая будет затем раскручиваться в обратном порядке от старости, зрелости, юности, детства и младенчества, обратно к рождению и так далее через различные жизни.

### <h3 id="question-71">Вопрос 71</h3>

Когда дух спускается для возрождения, притягивая к себе вещество ума и ныряя в мир Желаний, не оказывается ли он опять в чистилище?

Ответ: Проблема спрашивающего в том, что он не полностью представляет себе, что составляет чистилище. Чистилище находится в нижних слоях мира Желаний, но эти слои не являются чистилищем для тех, кому не от чего очищаться. Низкие желания человека образуются из вещества желаний этих слоев, и, поскольку их нельзя удовлетворить, человек страдает. Сверх того, главной силой там является сила отталкивания, и, когда Эго уходит на Первое небо, в теле желаний у него остаются картины совершенных им дурных деяний. Эти картины также образуются из грубого вещества желаний, потому что они были порождены страстями человека в то время, когда он совершал дурные поступки, отображенные в картинах, и центробежная сила отталкивания стремится вытолкнуть их из структуры. В процессе их вырывания порождается ощущаемая человеком боль. Когда, с другой стороны, Эго проходит через нижние слои мира Желаний на своем пути к возрождению, центростремительная сила притяжения приносит новое вещество желаний в его структуру. Но в этот раз эта область отнюдь не является для него чистилищем, как и для невидимых помощников, перемещающихся среди духов в тюрьме, пытаясь помочь им выучить уроки, которые сделают их лучше. Лишь в том случае, когда грех должен быть искоренен духом, последний ощущает эти слои как чистилище.

### <h3 id="question-72">Вопрос 72</h3>

Как вы можете верить в теорию перевоплощения, утверждающую, что мы вернемся сюда в теле животного? Не более ли привлекательно верить в христианское учение, что мы восходим на небо с Богом и ангелами?

Ответ: Автор никогда не поддерживал взгляды, приписываемые ему спрашивающим, который, очевидно, совершенно незнаком с данным предметом. На Востоке среди самых невежественных племен бытует теория переселения, утверждающая, что человеческий дух может воплощаться в тела животных, но подобная теория очень далека от учения перевоплощения, полагающего, что человек является развивающимся существом, продвигающимся в школе жизни посредством повторяющихся воплощений в тела все более высокого качества и совершенного строения. Христос говорил своим ученикам: «Итак, будьте совершенны, как совершен Отец ваш Небесный». Этот четкий приказ Христос никогда бы не отдал, если бы его было невозможно выполнить; но мы точно знаем, что не сможем достичь этой цели за одну короткую жизнь. Получив время и возможности, предоставляемые в результате повторяющихся воплощений и изменяющегося окружения, тем не менее мы когда-нибудь сможем завершить работу по самосовершенствованию.

В священных писаниях Востока нет ни одного авторитетного высказывания в пользу теории переселения душ. Единственное подобие таким представлениям можно найти в Катха упанишаде, главе 5, строфа 9, где говорится, что некоторые души возвращаются в лоно женщины для возрождения, а другие переводятся в неподвижное состояние. Это, по мнению некоторых, означает, что они могут перевоплощаться, опускаясь вплоть до минерального царства. Санскритское слово, используемое в этом отрывке, sthanu, означающее, помимо прочего, «опора, подножие» и прочитанное таким образом, получает тот же смысл, что и в отрывке из Откровения, где сказано: «Побеждающего сделаю столпом в храме Бога Моего, и он уже не выйдет вон». Когда человечество достигнет совершенства, придет время, когда оно уже больше не будет привязано к колесу рождений и смерти, но будет оставаться в Невидимых мирах, чтобы работать там для духовного подъема остальных существ.

Кроме того, переселение душ невозможно в природе, потому что в каждом человеческом теле обитает Индивидуальный Дух, в то время как каждый вид животных управляется общим Групповым Духом, частью которого все эти животные являются, и ни одно самосознающее Эго не может войти в тело, управляемое другим духом.

Спрашивающий задает вопрос: не лучше ли верить в небо с Богом и ангелами? Возможно, лучше, но нас занимает не то, что угождает нашему преходящему воображению, а поиск истины, и, хотя теория перевоплощений иногда высмеивается умниками как невероятная и языческая доктрина, вопрос не в том, насколько она невероятна. Когда мы имеем дело с математической проблемой, нам неважно, кто первым ее решил; единственное, что имеет для нас значение, — была ли она решена верно. Так и с этой теорией: неважно, кто первым ее преподал, она одна решает все жизненные проблемы разумным образом. Кстати, предположение, что человек, который никогда не интересовался музыкой и не знал даже основ гармонии, сразу же после смерти проявит ненасытную жажду к музыке и будет наслаждаться гудением на трубе или треньканьем на арфе на протяжении всей вечности, гораздо более нелепо.

### <h3 id="question-73">Вопрос 73</h3>

Почему каждое вероисповедание интерпретирует Библию по-своему, и почему каждый получает из этой книги очевидные доказательства своим представлениям?

Ответ: Этот вопрос, если его задает скептик, доставляет ему массу удовлетворения, так как он видит в нем доказательство своей теории о том, что все вероисповедания ошибаются в своих верованиях и что Библия — конгломерат ерунды, хотя в действительности дело совсем в другом. Мы не доказываем божественность этой книги и не настаиваем на том, что все в ней — Слово Божие от корки до корки. Мы согласны с тем, что это не совсем удачный перевод оригиналов, в котором много вставок, внесенных в разное время для подтверждения различных идей, но тем не менее сам факт, что столько истины вмещено в столь малые пределы, является источником постоянного удивления для эзотерика, знающего, что это за Книга на самом деле и имеющего ключ к ее прочтению.

Существует один факт, который скептик не смог разглядеть. Это утверждение о том, что если определенная интерпретация верна, то все остальные интерпретации обязательно будут ложны. Истина многогранна и бесконечна; поиск истины тоже должен быть всеобъемлющ и бесконечен. Мы можем уподобить истину горе, а различные интерпретации истины — разным дорогам, ведущим к ее вершине. Многие люди путешествуют по этим дорогам, и каждый из них думает, что его дорога единственная, хотя он находится у подножия; он видит лишь малую часть горы, что может служить ему оправданием для критики своих собратьев: «Вы не правы, идите по моей дороге, это единственная дорога, ведущая к вершине». Но когда все эти люди продвинутся вверх, они увидят, что дороги сходятся на вершине и что изначально дорога едина.

Выражаясь еще более определенно, можно сказать, что любая система мысли, способная привлечь и удержать внимание огромного числа людей на протяжении определенного времени, содержит истину независимо от того, следуем мы этой системе или нет. В каждом вероисповедании и секте есть зерно божественного учения, которое постепенно приводит своих последователей к вершине горы, и поэтому мы должны приучать себя к величайшей терпимости по отношению к любой вере.

### <h3 id="question-74">Вопрос 74</h3>

Что означает второй аспект Триединого Бога?

Ответ: Бог един, как един и свет. Но, проходя через атмосферу, свет преломляется, образуя три основных цвета — красный, желтый и синий. Так же и Бог, проявляясь, или преломляясь, в природе, троичен в своем проявлении. Первым является принцип созидания, затем — принцип сохранения и третьим — принцип разрушения форм, которые созданы и сохраняются, пока они полезны, с тем чтобы потом их разрушить, а материал, из которого они были сделаны, использовать для строительства новых форм.

Эти три принципа Бога названы по-разному в разных религиях, и много чернил и гусиных перьев было потрачено за истекшие века для защиты или осуждения идеи триединства, хотя это должно быть очевидно каждому, кто вдумчиво изучает окружающую его природу. В западном мире мы обычно называем второй аспект триединого Бога, всеобщий принцип сохранения, Христом, и в определенном смысле это очень точно, потому что Христос пришел как Учитель любви и всеобщего Братства, которое придет на смену нациям, воюющим друг против друга. Сам же Он говорил, что существует еще более высокая ступень, где Царство, которое он пришел установить, будет посвящено Отцу и все будут едины в Нем.

### <h3 id="question-75">Вопрос 75</h3>

Являются ли Ангелы-регистраторы индивидуальными Существами?

Ответ: Да, это могущественные Индивидуальности, представители великих Планетарных Ангелов, и, будучи таковыми, они заботятся о рождении человека, помогая ему в выборе его окружения и определяя для каждой жизни должную судьбу, которую человек готов отработать. Они направляют звездные влияния так, что они воздействуют на каждого, способствуя ликвидации прошлых долгов по отношению к остальным людям и помогая пожинать благотворные результаты того добра, которое было совершено в прошлых жизнях.

В этой деятельности Ангелам-регистраторам помогают могущественные воинства действующих сил и духов природы, которые еще не индивидуализировались и работают под управлением этих великих Существ бессознательно, во многом подобно тому, как животные управляются Групповыми Духами.

### <h3 id="question-76">Вопрос 76</h3>

Наблюдают ли Ангелы и Архангелы лично за каждым из нас и за всеми вместе, в точности зная, что собой представляют наши жизни?

Ответ: Владыки Разума, которых апостол Павел называет Силами Тьмы, поскольку они были человечеством темного периода Сатурна, когда Вселенная только появлялась из Хаоса, работают только с человеком.

Архангелы, которые были человечеством в огненный период Солнца, когда мироздание находилось на уровне вещества желаний, работают помощниками Групповых Духов животных и как Расовые Духи человечества, так как эти классы живых существ обладают телом желаний.

Ангелы, которые были человечеством периода Луны, работают с человеком, животными и растениями, поскольку в период Луны мироздание находилось на уровне эфира, и жизненные тела трех названных царств образованы из этого материала. Поэтому Ангелы по существу являются помощниками в осуществлении жизненных функций, таких, как усвоение, рост и размножение, и в своей работе с человечеством они являются Родовыми Духами. Они вызывают прибавление семейства, увеличение поголовья принадлежащего человеку скота и рост урожайности на полях.

Сам по себе человек, который «не много унижен пред Ангелами», работает с полезными ископаемыми, находящимися в химическом слое Физического мира, состоящего из газов, жидкостей и твердых веществ. Он является для полезных ископаемых тем же, чем высшие существа являются для нас. Человек постоянно пробуждает минералы к жизни, создавая из них дома, мосты, железные дороги и так далее.

В будущих воплощениях на Земле, когда эти минералы станут растениеподобными, человек научится работать с жизнью и будет по отношению к ним в положении, подобном тому, которое Ангелы сейчас занимают по отношению к нам. Итак, эта последовательность бесконечна, высшее всегда помогает тому, что менее развито, пока все не достигнут совершенства.

Отвечая на вопрос более конкретно, можно сказать, что Архангелы работают с нациями и расами на Земле, в то время как Ангелы заботятся, в основном о семьях и отдельных представителях семьи. Однако Ангел-хранитель не является существом более высокого развития; скорее это олицетворенное воплощение наших хороших поступков во всех наших предыдущих жизнях, которые, хотя и неведомы нам, всегда остаются с нами, побуждая нас к правильным действиям и свершению большего добра.

### <h3 id="question-77">Вопрос 77</h3>

Есть ли у Ангелов крылья, которые изображаются на картинах?

Ответ: Нет, ни один из них не имеет таких птичьих крыльев, как изображается на картинах, но существуют некоторые классы существ в мире духа, у которых есть подобные крыльям придатки. Однако они предназначены не для полета или передвижения в пространстве, а являются потоками исходящей силы, которая позволяет перемещаться в том или ином направлении подобно тому, как мы используем наши руки или ноги. Так, Архангел, направляющий на битву армии двух государств, может послать поток духовной силы в одном направлении, вызывая оцепенение у солдат одной армии, и может послать другую силу, чтобы вселить в другую армию дополнительную отвагу, поворачивая ход битвы так, как противники и не предполагали.

### <h3 id="question-78">Вопрос 78</h3>

Принимают ли розенкрейцеры Библию как «Слово Божие» от корки до корки?

Ответ: Конечно нет. В особенности им не близка та чрезвычайно узкая позиция некоторых людей, что та книга, которая сейчас у нас есть, это единственное подлинное Писание, данное человечеству. Вообще говоря, Библия может быть только одной из книг Бога, поскольку существует много других священных писаний, также притязающих на такое признание, которые не могут быть сброшены со счетов несколькими умниками, вроде тех, что буквально отправили на свалку апокрифы.

Во-первых, необходимо помнить, что Ветхий Завет писался на иврите в разное время и разными авторами и что до Ездры не было сделано сборника этих писаний. От этих рукописей на иврите сейчас не сохранилось ни клочка. Уже с 280 года до н. э. иврит для библейских писаний не использовался и широко распространился греческий перевод, Септуагинта. Эта Библия была единственной во время рождения Христа. Позднее некоторые рукописи на иврите были собраны и сверены масоретами, сектой, существовавшей примерно с 700 года н. э. Их текст самый лучший и наиболее точный.

Английский перевод, наиболее распространенный в наше время, — это Библия короля Якова. Но его величество волновала не столько точность перевода, сколько спокойствие в стране. И постановление, санкционировавшее перевод Библии, запрещало переводчикам переводить некоторые отрывки таким образом, чтобы они противоречили существовавшим верованиям. Эти меры были предприняты для избежания любого восстания или раскола в его королевстве. Из сорока семи переводчиков только три были знатоками иврита, и два из них умерли, прежде чем были переведены псалмы. Некоторые книги были отброшены как апокрифы, тексты были искажены и истинное их значение изменено, чтобы удовлетворять религиозным предрассудкам своего века. Мартин Лютер в Германии перевел с латыни текст, который до того был переведен с греческого. Таким образом, вероятность передачи неправильных значений повысилась во много раз, и количество способов искаженной передачи также приумножилось. Следует учесть, что в древнем иврите не было огласовок и разделения на слова, так что, если пометить огласовки иным образом, можно получить почти из каждого предложения слова и предложения абсолютно иного значения. В свете этого становится очевидным, что наши шансы получить точный перевод того, что было изначально написано, действительно малы.

Более того, подлинные авторы Библии совсем не имели намерения сделать «Книгу Бога» общедоступной, как легко можно видеть из следующей цитаты Книги Зогар: «Горе человеку, который видит в Торе (Законе, Библии) только простое изложение и обычные слова, потому что, если бы на самом деле она содержала лишь их, мы даже сегодня могли бы сочинить Тору, более достойную восхищения. Но это не так; каждое слово в Торе содержит возвышенное значение и едва уловимую тайну... Описания Торы — это ее облачения; знающий человек обращает внимание не на облачение, но на то, что скрыто под ним...»

Другими словами, важна не буква, а только дух. И так же, как на засеянном картофелем поле есть не только овощи, но и почва, в которой они скрыты, так же и в Библии жемчужины эзотерической истины скрыты в том, что часто является отталкивающим одеянием. Эзотерик, достойный обладания этими жемчужинами, получает ключ и может ясно их видеть. Остальные не могут их различить, пока они также не заслужат ключ. Так, сюжет скитания детей Израиля и взаимодействия Бога с ними частично верен, но существует еще и духовное значение, которое гораздо важнее, чем земная история. Даже Евангелия, хотя они и содержат основные события жизни человека, называемого Иисусом, являются формулой Посвящения, показывающей тот опыт, который должен пережить каждый на пути к истине и жизни.

Разные люди, которые писали Библию и были пророками и провидцами, этот путь предвосхищали, но лишь настолько, насколько это было возможно в их время и в их век. Новому Веку потребуется новая Библия, новое слово.

### <h3 id="question-79">Вопрос 79</h3>

Как розенкрейцеры относятся к представлению о том, что мир был создан за семь дней?

Ответ: В Библии приводится два сюжета творения. Первый начинается с первой строки открывающейся главы и заканчивается третьей строкой второй главы Книги Бытия. Другое изложение начинается с четвертой строки.

Кажется, что у этих двух сюжетов творения есть серьезные разногласия в нескольких деталях. Первый отчет констатирует, что Земля была покрыта водой; во втором утверждается, что она была сухой. Первая версия сообщает нам, что человек был создан последним; вторая говорит, что он был создан первым, и так далее. Эти противоречия кажутся непримиримыми и доставляют скептику огромное удовлетворение, когда он подробно их излагает с улыбкой презрительного сожаления по отношению к невежественным глупцам, верящим в такую чепуху. Тем не менее эти два отчета в действительности не столь уж несовместимы, они дополняют друг друга и соответствуют научным фактам. Первая глава относится к происхождению форм, вторая глава — к эволюции сознания. Человеческая форма, какой она является в настоящее время, — это шедевр эволюции, она построена на основе всех предшествовавших ей низших форм. Жизнь, которая является человеком, мыслителем, не имеет ни начала, ни конца, она вечна, как сам Бог, и эта Жизнь была здесь до всех форм, что и сообщается во втором сюжете творения.

Что касается времени, за которое, как написано, была создана форма, то розенкрейцеры не учат и не верят тому, что творение было завершено за семь дней по двадцать четыре часа каждый. Они утверждают, что в нашей схеме проявления необходимы семь великих преобразований Земли для продвижения полной эволюции самосознания и силы души развивающимися духами. Три с половиной из этих периодов были потрачены на создание проводников; остальные потребуются для эволюции сознания.

Первый стих Библии утверждает, что в начале Земля была темна и бесформенна. Так было в период Сатурна, когда зарождающийся огненный туман образовывался из первичного вещества пространства.

Третий стих сообщает нам: «И сказал Бог: да будет свет». Над этим отрывком насмехаются, так как он якобы показывает невежество авторов и несоответствие с научными фактами. Насмешник говорит: «Как мог появиться свет, пока не были созданы Солнце и Луна вплоть до четвертого дня?» Мы не имеем дело с тем миром, каким он является сейчас, твердой массой. В этом случае без внешнего источника света было бы, конечно, темно, но в то время Земля была создающимся миром, а в соответствии с небулярной теорией сначала должна иметь место стадия горячей темноты, которой мы дали название периода Сатурна. Позже туман воспламеняется и светится; свет находится внутри и не зависит от внешнего Солнца или Луны. Этот второй этап в развитии нашей планеты называется периодом Солнца.

Затем написано: «И сказал Бог: да будет пространство посреди воды, и да отделяет оно воду от воды». Используемое здесь слово «пространство» в каноническом варианте звучит как «твердь, небесный свод», но мы используем масоретский текст, то есть перевод, не ограниченный королевским указом, которым руководствовались переводчики короля Якова. Использование термина «пространство» приводит Библию в согласие с небулярной теорией, так как, когда огненный туман появляется в пространстве, при взаимодействии этой горячей массы с окружающим пространством, которое было холодным, образуется влага. Эта влага начинает нагреваться и расширяться, превращаясь в пар, который устремляется наружу из огненного ядра, охлаждается там, конденсируется и притягивается обратно к источнику тепла. Так пространство посреди воды отделило воду от воды, оставляя плотную влагу ближе всего к огненному ядру и пар снаружи. Этот этап уплотнения Земли назван периодом Луны.

Постоянное кипение воды, окружавшей огненное ядро, привело к образованию накипи, коры, и появилась суша. Написано: «И назвал Бог сушу землею».

На протяжении первой части современного периода Земля была так же темна, как в период Сатурна. Тогда существовали только минеральные вещества. Этот этап назван Полярной эпохой.

Огненный период Солнца находит свое повторение в Гиперборейской эпохе, описанной в стихах 11 — 19 как время создания растений. Земля становится планетой, освещаемой извне Солнцем и Луной. Так заканчивается работа, описанная как выполняемая на четвертый великий день развития нашей Земли.

В Лемурийскую эпоху имеем краткое повторение условий периода Луны, огненное ядро и атмосферу огненного тумана, а также возникновение животных низшего уровня развития. Все это описано в Библии как работа пятого дня.

В Атлантическую эпоху были созданы позвоночные млекопитающие и человек, что описывается как работа шестого дня. И когда человек стал разумным существом во время нынешней Арийской эпохи, Боги почили, чтобы дать возможность человеку самому зарабатывать себе спасение в соответствии с двойным законом Возрождения и Причинности.

### <h3 id="question-80">Вопрос 80</h3>

Библия учит бессмертию души в авторитарной манере. Философия розенкрейцеров учит тому же, открыто обращаясь к разуму. Есть ли положительные подтверждения бессмертия?

Ответ: Спрашивающий ошибается, говоря, что Библия учит бессмертию души. В Ветхом Завете нет ни одного упоминания слова бессмертный, или небесный, в смысле обладания человеком этим качеством. Там недвусмысленно утверждается, что «Небо — небо Господу, а землю он дал сынам человеческим» (псалом 115, строка 16). Недвусмысленно написано, что «душа согрешающая, та умрет». Если бы душа была бессмертна, это было бы невыполнимо. В Новом Завете слово «бессмертный», или «бессмертие», употребляется только шесть раз. Это понятие определяется, как нечто, к чему следует стремиться, или как атрибут Бога.

Если речь идет о духе, то это иной случай, но даже там, где обсуждается эта тема, слово «бессмертный» не употребляется. Бессмертие означает то же, что и учение о возрождении, упоминаемое в многочисленных отрывках. Но даже учение о возрождении имеет преимущество перед учением о бессмертии человеческого духа, так как учение о возрождении было явно преподнесено, по крайней мере один раз, в Евангелии от Матфея 11:14, где Христос говорит об Иоанне Крестителе: «Он есть Илия». В этом учении вера в бессмертие выражена неявно, так как, если дух Илии возродился как Иоанн Креститель, он должен был пережить смерть тела. Учение о бессмертии в то время было одним из тайных учений, и даже в наши дни его едва ли можно получить, пока человек не встанет на путь Посвящения и сам для себя не увидит непрерывность жизни.

Отвечая далее на вопрос, можно сказать, что все зависит от того, что означает выражение «положительные подтверждения» и каков уровень знания у человека, который просит подтверждений, чтобы судить о них. Невозможно показать младенцу решение задачи по тригонометрии, но, если младенцу дать время подрасти и надлежащим образом обучить основам, тогда будет легко доказать решение. Так же мы не сможем доказать существование света и цвета слепорожденному человеку; он не сможет понять эти явления, поскольку у него нет необходимой для этого способности. Но если он в результате операции получит возможность видеть, доказывать эти факты будет излишне, он сам убедится в их истинности. По тем же причинам никто не может постичь доказательства бессмертия духа, пока сам не станет способным видеть дух; тогда ему будет легко получить положительные доказательства бессмертия духа, его существования до рождения и неизменности после смерти. Пока человек не обучится таким образом, он должен удовлетворяться умозаключениями, которые можно получить разными путями.

### <h3 id="question-81">Вопрос 81</h3>

Есть ли в Библии какие-либо свидетельства теории возрождения?

Ответ: Да, есть множество свидетельств, хотя напрямую об этом говорится лишь в одном месте. Еврейские священники верили в теорию перевоплощения, иначе они не послали бы спросить Иоанна Крестителя: «Ты Илия?», как это записано в первой главе Евангелия от Иоанна, в двадцать первом стихе. А в Евангелии от Матфея есть высказывание Христа относительно Иоанна Крестителя, точное и недвусмысленное. Христос говорит: «Он есть Илия». Также и потом, при других обстоятельствах, когда они были на горе Преображения, Христос сказал: «Илия пришел, и поступили с ним, как хотели», и сказано, что «тогда ученики поняли, что Он говорил им об Иоанне Крестителе», который был обезглавлен Иродом.

В Евангелии от Матфея, гл. 16, стих 13, Он спрашивает своих учеников: «За кого люди почитают Меня?». Они сказали: «Одни за Иоанна Крестителя, другие за Илию, а иные за Иеремию, или за одного из пророков». Заслуживает внимания то, что Христос совсем им не противоречил, так как Он был Учителем, и если они придерживались неверных взглядов относительно теории возрождения, то Его несомненным долгом было бы поправить их. Но Он этого не сделал. Более того, Он непосредственно обучал их этому, как в вышеприведенном отрывке.

В Библии упоминаются также случаи, когда человек был избран для определенной работы еще до рождения.

Ангел предсказал рождение Самсона и его миссию — уничтожить филистимлян. Господь говорит пророку Иеремии: «Прежде нежели ты вышел из утробы, Я освятил тебя: пророком для народов поставил тебя». Иоанн и Иисус имели предназначение и миссию еще до рождения. Человека выбирают для определенной миссии потому, что он особенно для нее подходит. Умение предполагает практику, а практика до рождения может быть только в предыдущей жизни. Таким образом, в приведенных выше цитатах теория возрождения подразумевается.

### <h3 id="question-82">Вопрос 82</h3>

По Библии только человеку была дана душа. Почему тогда вы говорите, что у животных есть Групповой Дух?

Ответ: В первой главе Книги Бытия, стих 20, написано, Бог сказал: «Да произведет вода пресмыкающихся», имеющих жизнь. В иврите используется слово nephesh, что значит бытие, жизнь, дыхание. Это слово также используется во второй главе, стихе 7, где говорится, что «И создал Господь Бог человека из праха земного, и вдунул в лице его дыхание жизни (nephesh), и стал человек nephesh chayim, душею живою». Правильно, однако, не «душею живою», как здесь переведено, а дышащим существом. Перевод, приведенный в версии короля Якова, был подправлен людьми, которых истина заботила гораздо меньше, чем предвзятые идеи. Они одобрили использование слова «душа» в качестве преимущественной альтернативы прочтению слова в главе 1, стих 20, где описывается создание животных, таким образом, даже в современных Библиях общепризнано, что у животных есть душа.

Тем не менее этот перевод неправильный. Nephesh означает дыхание, жизнь, а не душу. В иврите для души есть слово neshamah. Душа не является синонимом духу, который называется Ruach, так что Книга Бытия не затрагивает ни дух животного, ни дух человека, так как у духа нет начала. ОН ЕСТЬ. Формы животных и человека, поддерживаемые дыханием, имеют начало и именно об этом написано в Книге Бытия. Эта мысль полностью соответствует словам Соломона в книге Екклезиаста 3:19, где сказано (относительно того, что коль скоро тело создано из праха): «Участь сынов человеческих и участь животных — одна; как те умирают, так умирают и эти, и одно дыхание у всех (nephesh), и нет у человека преимуществ перед скотом». Все уходят в одно и то же место (а именно в мир Желаний).

Если спрашивающий приемлет только английский перевод и вариант Библии, будто она была написана непосредственно на этом языке, будет уместно спросить: если мужчина получил свою душу как описано в Библии, откуда женщина получила свою, или у нее нет души?

### <h3 id="question-83">Вопрос 83</h3>

Правда ли, что Ева вышла из бока Адама?

Ответ: Среди сорока семи переводчиков Библии короля Якова только трое понимали иврит, и двое из них умерли, прежде чем были переведены псалмы. Кроме того, в иврите, особенно при использовании старого стиля, никогда не употреблялись огласовки, и поэтому одно слово можно понять по-разному в соответствии с расставленными огласовками. В сюжете с ребром Адама слово, переведенное как «ребро», читается как tsad при одном варианте огласовок, что действительно означает ребро, но, если расставить огласовки иначе, оно читается как tsela, что означает сторона, бок. Эзотерическое учение о развитии Земли и человека утверждает, что было время, когда человек был подобен Богу, или Элохиму, который создал его, и в частности, пол. Человек был как мужчиной, так и женщиной, гермафродитом, способным производить другое существо из самого себя. Позже для его дальнейшей эволюции стало необходимо, чтобы развивался мозг. Поскольку раньше он испускал из себя двойную созидательную силу, положительную и отрицательную, ее половина была использована для постройки мозга, гортани и нервной системы в качестве органов мысли и «клавиатуры», при помощи которой дух мог бы управлять своим организмом и выражать себя через звук. Некоторые духи использовали положительную созидательную силу и испускали только отрицательную, или женскую, силу, а другие использовали женскую, или негативную, силу, а испускали положительную. Так что можно сказать, что Бог забрал одну сторону из их существа, но не ребро. Данное прочтение слова имеет такие же права на признание, как и перевод ребро, но имеет то достоинство, что может объяснить факты, иначе необъяснимые.

### <h3 id="question-84">Вопрос 84</h3>

Если Бог сделал человека по своему образу и подобию, по общему мнению, совершенному, почему были необходимы разные эпохи до падения Адама и Евы?

Ответ: Спрашивающий испытывает трудности, связанные с неправильным пониманием. В Библии сказано, что Бог увидел свою работу и что это было хорошо, а не совершенно. Если бы она была совершенной, больше нечего было бы делать и эволюция была бы излишней. Человеческая раса не была действительно человеческой до второй половины Лемурийской эпохи, когда дух начал спускаться в тела. Человечество этого периода, Адам и Ева, очень отличались от современного человечества. Они также были продуктами эволюции, так как не бывает мгновенного созидания. Эти существа продвинулись вперед, начав с минерального царства и пройдя через состояния, подобные растениям и животным, и это была не просто пара, как обычно понимается ортодоксальными религиями, а человечество, которое было как мужского, так и женского рода во времена, упоминаемые в Библии. Сказано, что «мужчину и женщину сотворил их»; более того, человек был на Земле уже не первый раз, то есть Земля уже населялась людьми, как можно видеть из Книги Бытия 1:28, где им было приказано выйти и снова наполнить Землю. Это показывает, что Земля уже была ранее жилищем неких других существ, предшествующих приходу тех, кто звался Адамом и Евой. Иосиф говорит, что Адам означает красная земля, а еврейское Admah, из которого происходит слово Адам, означает «твердая земля»; это хорошо описывает тогдашнее состояние. Adm (как дается в ивритском тексте) пришел на Землю только, когда она застыла и стала твердой, хотя он пришел прежде, чем Земля остыла до нынешнего состояния.

Итак, Земля, действительно была красной и огненной в тот момент. Человек был здесь раньше. Во время предшествующих эпох, до Лемурийской, духи парили над раскаленной Землей и помогали образовывать и формировать ее такой, какая она сейчас. Человеческие духи усваивали в то время уроки, к которым мы не имеем теперь отношения. В то время мы были бессознательными, но выполняли работу так же хорошо, как, например, наши органы пищеварения производят химические процессы, необходимые для пищеварения и усвоения, хотя мы и не осознаем эти процессы. Однако должно быть очевидно, что как работа детей в детских садах и начальной школе является тем важным фундаментом, на котором будет основываться дальнейшее обучение в высшей школе и колледжах, так и ранние эпохи явились основой для наших современных условий. Эти эпохи были так же необходимы, как необходимо изучение алфавита для овладения чтением.

### <h3 id="question-85">Вопрос 85</h3>

В чем заключался грех, или падение, в Эдеме?

Ответ: Когда Земля вышла из Хаоса, она оказалась на темной и красной стадии, известной как Полярная эпоха. Сначала человечество развивало плотное тело, конечно, абсолютно не такое, как наш современный проводник. Когда условия на Земле изменились и она стала огненной, как в Гиперборейскую эпоху, добавилось жизненное тело. Человек стал подобен растению, то есть у него были те же проводники, какие сейчас есть у наших растений, а также подобное растениям сознание, или скорее бессознательность, состояние, которое бывает у нас во время сна без сновидений, когда плотное и жизненное тело покоятся в постели.

Во времена Гиперборейской эпохи тело человека было как огромный газовый мешок, летающий над огненной Землей. Он выбрасывал растениеподобные споры, которые вырастали и затем использовались другими приходящими существами. В это время человек имел двойной пол, то есть был гермафродитом.

В Лемурийскую эпоху, когда Земля немного остыла и острова с твердым поверхностным слоем начали образовываться среди кипящих морей, тело человека как бы затвердело и приняло форму, более похожую на современную. Оно было подобно телу обезьяны: короткое туловище с огромными руками и ногами, с выступающими назад пятками и почти без головы; по крайней мере верхняя часть головы почти полностью отсутствовала. Человек жил в атмосфере пара, который эзотерики называют огненным туманом. У человека не было легких, он не дышал с помощью дыхательных каналов. Внутри у него был орган, похожий на пузырь, который он наполнял горячим воздухом, чтобы с его помощью прыгать через огромные пропасти, когда извержения вулканов разрушали сушу, на которой он жил. В задней части головы у него был выступающий орган, который в наше время втянулся внутрь и который анатомы называют шишковидной железой, или третьим глазом, хотя он никогда не был глазом, а лишь локализованным органом чувств. Тело тогда было лишено способности чувствовать, но, когда человек подходил слишком близко к кратеру вулкана, жар регистрировался этим органом и предупреждал об опасности прежде, чем тело могло быть разрушено.

К этому времени тело столь сильно отвердело, что человеку стало невозможно размножаться спорами и появилась необходимость развить мыслительный орган, мозг. Созидательная сила, которую мы сейчас используем во внешнем мире для строительства железных дорог, пароходов и так далее, раньше использовалась внутри для строительства органов. Как и все силы, она имела положительную и отрицательную составляющие. Один полюс был направлен внутрь на строение мозга, второй полюс был оставлен для создания другого тела. Так человек перестал быть единой созидательной единицей.

Теперь каждый обладал половиной созидательной силы, и поэтому ему стало необходимо искать свое дополнение снаружи.

Но пока «их глаза не открылись», человеческие существа не осознавали друг друга в Физическом мире, хотя хорошо осознавали друг друга и были пробудившимися в Духовном мире. Поэтому под управлением Ангелов, которые были специально предназначены для того, чтобы помогать им в продолжении рода, их собирали вместе в больших храмах в определенное время года, когда межпланетные линии силы располагались благоприятно, и тогда акт созидания происходил как религиозная жертва. Когда этот примитивный человек, Адам, вступал в интимный сексуальный контакт с женщиной, дух на мгновение проникал в плоть. Поэтому говорится, что «познал Адам (или осознал) жену свою»; он ощутил ее физически. Именно так записано в Библии, которая использует это целомудренное выражение на протяжении всех своих страниц, поскольку написано: «И познал Елкана Анну, жену свою», и она родила Самуила. Даже в Новом Завете, когда Ангел приходит к Марии, сообщая ей, что она должна стать матерью Спасителя, она отвечает: «Как будет это, когда Я мужа не знаю?»

Грех — это действие, противоположное закону, и, пока человечество воспроизводилось под руководством Ангелов, которые были сведущи в космических линиях силы, роды были безболезненными, как это сейчас происходит у диких зверей, которые размножаются только в надлежащее время года, направляясь Групповым Духом. Но когда человек, действуя по совету некоторых духов, находящихся на полпути между человечеством и Ангелами, предпринял попытку воспроизвести себя в любое и всякое время года, независимо от космических линий силы, этот грех, или то, что он «ел от дерева познания», привело к болезненным родам, о которых Ангел предупредил Еву. Он не проклял ее, а просто определил, каким будет результат невежественного и беспорядочного использования созидательной функции.

### <h3 id="question-86">Вопрос 86</h3>

Является ли дерево жизни, о котором говорится в Библии, тем же, что и философский камень алхимиков?

Ответ: И да, и нет. Чтобы разобраться в этом вопросе, необходимо вернуться назад, заглянув в историю человечества. Было время, когда человек был двуполым и мог воспроизводить тела без помощи другого. Но когда стало необходимо построить мозг, чтобы дух мог созидать мыслью и в Физическом мире, половина созидательной силы была использована для построения мыслительного органа. Тогда каждому пришлось искать союза с другим, представлявшим противоположный полюс созидательной силы, которую он сделал доступной для своего использования в сексуальных целях. Поскольку люди не имели мозга и «их глаза не были открыты», они не обладали сознанием Физического мира и не могли отвечать за себя. Поэтому Ангелы собирали их вместе в определенное время года, когда планетарные силы были благоприятны для выполнения акта воспроизводства как религиозной жертвы, посредством которой они отдавали часть своего тела для созидания проводника для другого духа. В момент тесных объятий дух впервые проник сквозь завесу плоти и Адам «познал» свою жену. Позже, когда сознание человечества немного больше сфокусировалось на Физическом мире, некоторые начали смутно воспринимать тела, которые мы теперь полностью ощущаем. Эти первопроходцы стали проповедовать евангелие тела, сообщая другим, что они обладают физическим телом, так как большинство не осознавало, что владеет этим инструментом, как сейчас мы не осознаем, что у нас есть желудок, если он не болит.

Потом было замечено, что эти тела умирали, и у первопроходцев расы возник вопрос, как можно заменять такие тела. Решение было подсказано человеку определенным классом духов, которые были отставшими в эволюции Ангелов; можно сказать, что это были полубоги. Эти Духи Люцифера, или дарители огня, просветили рождающееся человечество относительно их силы производить тела в любое время. Но такие тела тогда не были совершенными — они несовершенны и сейчас — и, конечно, воспроизводство без учета планетарных условий стало порождать худшие тела, чем раньше, и привело к болезненным родам, как было предсказано Ангелом.

С этого момента невежественная человеческая раса стала неограниченно применять функцию воспроизведения. Но благодаря смерти у Ангелов осталась возможность обучать человечество между смертью и новым рождением, как строить постепенно улучшающиеся тела. Если бы человек обучился в далеком прошлом обновлению своего жизненного тела, как он был обучен производить плотный проводник по своему желанию, тогда смерти бы не было и человек стал бы бессмертным как Боги. Но тогда он бы увековечил свои несовершенства и сделал невозможным прогресс. Обновление жизненного тела обозначено в Библии как вкушение «от дерева жизни». Когда человека просвещали относительно воспроизводства, человек был духовным существом, глаза которого еще не были ослеплены материальным миром, и он мог бы узнать секрет оживления жизненного тела по своей воле, таким образом препятствуя эволюции. Итак, мы видим, что смерть, если она приходит естественным путем, является не проклятием, а нашим самым большим и лучшим другом, так как она освобождает нас от инструмента, с помощью которого мы больше ничему не можем научиться. Она извлекает нас из окружения, которое мы переросли, после чего мы можем научиться строить лучшие тела в окружении с более широкими возможностями, в котором мы сможем быстрее продвигаться к цели, то есть к совершенству.

В процессе этого странствия наконец-то приходит время, когда человек готов обладать силами жизни. Сделанное им самим для себя тело становится чистым и может служить гораздо дольше, чем сейчас. Затем он начинает искать философский камень, или эликсир жизни, можно использовать любое другое название. Алхимики стремились получить этот чистый и священный проводник, но не химическим процессом в лаборатории, как предполагают невежественные люди. Терминология, скрывающая смысл, была создана специально, потому что они жили в век, когда господствующая и отступническая церковь приговорила бы их к смерти, если бы стала известна правда. Когда они говорили о превращении основных металлов в золото, они говорили правду не только с материальной точки зрения, но и с духовной, так как золото всегда было символом духа, и эти алхимики стремились одухотворить свои тела, имеющие более низменный характер.

Повсюду дается чистый и прекрасный символ прозрачности для обозначения силы чистоты. В Ветхом Завете говорится о том, что «ни молота, ни тесла, ни всякого другого железного орудия не было слышно в храме при строении его». Самой прекрасной храмовой утварью было литое море. Хирам Абиф, искусный мастер, сумел в качестве своего завершающего достижения отлить все металлы Земли в сплав, прозрачный как стекло. В Ветхом Завете говорится в конце о прекрасном городе, в середине которого — море стеклянное. На Востоке посвященный стремится стать алмазной душой, чистой и прозрачной. На Западе философский камень является символом очищенной души, выделенной из преобразованных и одухотворенных тел. «Душа согрешающая, та умрет», а чистая душа увековечивается эликсиром жизни, «деревом жизни», в таком жизненном тело, которое будет жить тысячелетия как проводник духа.

### <h3 id="question-87">Вопрос 87</h3>

Господь признал кровавое подношение Авеля, но пренебрег свежим и чистым подношением Каина. Почему?

Ответ: Спрашивающий заблуждается. Подношение Авеля не было кровавым. Нигде не утверждается, что Авель убивал животных. В масонской легенде, которую мы приводим частично, говорится следующее.

Однажды Элохим создал Еву, соединился с ней, и она родила Каина; он покинул ее до рождения Каина, и Каин, таким образом, оказался «сыном вдовы». Затем Элохим Иегова создал Адама, который соединился с Евой, и она родила Авеля. Через какое-то время Каин и Авель принесли свои подношения Иегове. Авель принес от своих стад, созданных Богом, а Каин принес плод своего собственного труда, зерно. И Иегова принял дар, который Авеля, созданный природой, но отверг жертву, которая была результатом творческой способности Каина. Тогда Каин умертвил Авеля и был проклят. Адам опять соединился с Евой, и она родила Сифа.

От Каина и Сифа пошли два типа людей. Потомками Каина были Тувал Каин и Хирам Абиф, умелые и искусные мастера, знавшие, как своими руками создавать вещи, они обладали божественной способностью созидания и знали, как создать два листика травы, где раньше был только один, и от них пошли все те, кто работает руками и пытается покорить Землю и использовать ее ресурсы.

Потомками Сифа стали цари и священники, получившие мудрость готовой от Бога и принимавшие все таким, каким оно было. Среди них был Соломон, самый мудрый среди людей, но он не трудился сам для обретения мудрости, а получил ее в дар от Бога. Эти два типа людей встречаются на Земле по сей день и борются за превосходство. Одни представляют прогрессивные мирские власти, другие — консервативное духовенство.

Тогда причина, по которой Иегова принял приношение Авеля, заключалась в том, что Авель принимал все таким, каким оно было создано; он был сыном человека и не стремился к божественному творчеству. Но Каин обладал божественной природой, у него был творческий инстинкт; и это было не по нраву Иегове.

### <h3 id="question-88">Вопрос 88</h3>

В чем эзотерический смысл Ковчега завета?

Ответ: В первых главах Библии рассказывается о падении в Эдеме, когда человек взял созидательные силы в свои руки, невежественно их использовал и тем самым согрешил перед законами природы. Роды — это дар жизненного тела, которое является отражением Жизненного Духа, второго аспекта триединого Духа в человеке.

Написано, что Херувимы были поставлены на стражу с огненным мечом, когда человек был изгнан из Эдема, чтобы он не вкусил от дерева жизни и не стал бессмертным, так как Херувимы — это великая Творческая Иерархия, которая была ответственна за Землю в период Солнца, когда зародилось жизненное тело и пробудилась жизнь духа. Затем началось длительное странствие через пустыню материи, и Ковчег завета был символом человека в период его скитания. Во время скитаний по пустыне шесты, на которых носили Ковчег, всегда оставляли на своих местах, чтобы показать, что у него нет постоянного места, но, когда он оказался в храме, созданном без звука молота, храме Соломона, его странствие окончилось и шесты были удалены.

Его роль как символа человека заключалась в том, что он содержал Книгу Закона, данную для обучения правильным действиям. Находившийся в Ковчеге жезл Аарона, жезл могущества, расцвел, символизируя духовную силу, спящую в каждом человеке. Копией этого жезла было копье Парсифаля, орудие зла в руках черного мага Клингзора и в руках римского солдата, но чистый и возвышенный Парсифаль использовал его для исцеления раны Амфортаса. Жезл Аарона использовался в Египте, чтобы вызывать страдание и горе, и затем был спрятан внутри Ковчега, как символ того, что человек, когда-то обладавший духовной силой, неправильно ее использовал и теперь она скрыта внутри.

Там был и сосуд с манной. Манна не была пищей для тела, как это объясняют материалисты. Слово манна почти универсально. На санскрите это «manas», мыслитель. В немецком, английском, в скандинавских и многих других языках существует одно и то же слово «man» для обозначения мыслителя. Помещение сосуда с манной напоминает о том времени, когда Эго сошло в форму, построенную им для себя, и стало внутрисущим индивидуальным духом.

Так осуществилось «падение» в материальные условия, с неизбежностью повлекшее за собой рождение плотных тел. Когда человек присвоил себе право воспроизводить потомство в любое время, он был выслан из эфирного слоя, чтобы не дать ему заполучить секрет оживления несовершенных тел, которые он порождал, поскольку это могло прервать эволюцию.

В первой части ответа на вопрос было сказано, что Херувимы были создателями наших жизненных сил, следовательно, они должны охранять их, пока человек не научится контролировать себя. Поэтому написано, что они находятся около Эдемского сада с огненным мечом, а у дверей в храм Соломона стоят херувимы, которые держат в руках — и это очень важно — уже не огненный меч, а распустившийся цветок. Цветок является органом воспроизведения растений, которые совершают акт порождения чистым, бесстрастным образом, и, когда человек научится, как становиться чистым и бесстрастным, чтобы любая и каждая форма зарождалась безупречной, он сможет войти в храм Бога, как Ковчег вошел в храм Соломона, и сможет остаться там, что в случае Ковчега обозначено удалением шестов. И как пророчески сказано духом в Откровении: «Побеждающего сделаю столпом в храме Бога Моего, и он уже не выйдет вон».

Есть ли какое-либо эзотерическое значение у различных христианских праздников, отмечаемых в течение года?

Ответ: Да, праздники, проводимые в течение года, имеют очень глубокое эзотерическое значение. С физической точки зрения планеты представляют собой всего лишь большие скопления вещества, которые вращаются по своим орбитам, подчиняясь так называемым слепым законам, но с эзотерической точки зрения они — Великие Духи, движущиеся в космическом пространстве, подобно тому, как мы движемся в земной жизни.

Видя жестикулирующего человека, мы приписываем какой-то смысл его жестам. Если он качает головой, мы знаем, что он отклоняет какое-то предложение, но если он кивает, то мы заключаем, что он соглашается. Если он делает знаки руками, обратив ладони к себе, мы знаем, что он кого-то зовет подойти к себе, но если он направляет ладони наружу, мы понимаем, что он просит кого-то не подходить. Но в отношении Вселенной мы обычно не думаем, что есть какой-то смысл в изменении положения планет, для эзотериков же небесные явления имеют глубочайшее значение. Можно сказать, что они соответствуют жестам человека.

Кришна означает помазанный, и всякий, кто должен был выполнить особую миссию, в древние времена также проходил обряд помазания. Когда в зимнее время в процессе своего движения Солнце оказывается ниже небесного экватора в точке надира, духовные импульсы становятся самыми сильными в мире. Однако для нашего материального благополучия необходимо, чтобы Солнце вернулось обратно в северную полусферу, и поэтому мы говорим о моменте, когда Солнце начинает свой путь на север, как о Рождестве, рождении Спасителя, помазанного спасти нас от голода и холода, которые непременно последовали бы, если бы Солнце осталось в точке надира навсегда.

По мере того как Солнце перемещается к экватору, оно проходит через знак Водолея, и в это время Земля затопляется дождями, символизирующими крещение Спасителя. Затем в марте Солнце проходит через знак Рыб. Запасы прошлого года уже все израсходованы, и пища человека становится скудной, поэтому наступает длительный Великий Пост. Этот особый этап солнечного путешествия символизируется употреблением в пищу рыбы.

Затем приходит еврейская Пасха (Passover — «переход»), когда Солнце переходит через экватор. Во время христианской Пасхи (Easter; east — восток) Солнце находится в восточном узле. Это пересечение экватора образует крест и символизируется так называемым распятием Спасителя; затем Солнце идет в знак Овна, барана, и становится Агнцем Божьим, отданным за спасение мира в то время, когда начинают прорастать растения. Однако для того чтобы жертва принесла пользу человеку, Солнце должно подняться выше в небо, откуда его лучи помогут созреть винограду и зерну; так, во время летнего солнцестояния в июне мы отмечаем праздник Вознесения Спасителя к Трону Отца. Там Солнце остается в течение трех дней. Затем наступает фаза движения, которая выражается поговоркой «Оттуда он вернется», и Солнце продолжает свой путь к западному узлу. В тот момент, когда Солнце входит в знак Девы, мы отмечаем праздник Успения Пресвятой Богородицы. Позже, когда оно покидает знак Девы, мы отмечаем Рождество Пресвятой Богородицы, которая, таким образом, представляется рожденной от Солнца.

Еврейский праздник Кущей наступает, когда Солнце пересекает экватор при переходе к зимним месяцам. Этот праздник сопровождался взвешиванием зерна и сбором винограда, которые являются дарами Солнечного Бога верующим в него людям.

Таким образом, все праздники года связаны с движением светил в космическом пространстве.

### <h3 id="question-90">Вопрос 90</h3>

Я поняла так, что вы говорите, будто Христос воплощался только один раз в Иисуса; не воплощался ли он в Гаутаму Будду и еще раньше в Кришну?

Ответ: Нет. Сам Иисус был духом, принадлежащим нашей человеческой эволюции, так же как и Гаутама Будда. У автора нет информации о Кришне, но он склонен верить, что Кришна тоже был духом, относящимся к человеческой расе, потому что индийские рассказы о нем повествуют о том, как он взошел на небо и что там произошло. Дух Христа, который снизошел в тело Иисуса, когда сам Иисус освободил это тело, был лучом космического Христа. Мы можем проследить прошлые воплощения Иисуса и увидеть путь его развития до настоящего дня. Дух Христа, напротив, не может быть найден среди наших земных духов.

Можно сказать, что до Своего прихода Христос работал с Землей извне, во многом так же, как Групповые Духи работают извне с животными, направляя их и помогая им, пока они не станут достаточно индивидуализированными, чтобы стать обиталищем для индивидуального духа. До пришествия Христа у Земли не было внутрисущего Духа, но к тому моменту, когда на Голгофе была совершена жертва и дух Христа был освобожден из тела Иисуса, он спустился в тело Земли и теперь является внутрисущим Духом Земли, который, по словам апостола Павла «стенает и мучится», ожидая дня освобождения, поскольку в отличие от общепринятого мнения жертва на Голгофе не завершилась смертью тела Иисуса. На самом деле можно сказать, что данное событие было только началом жертвоприношения, которое будет продолжаться, пока мы не разовьем альтруизм и любовь, которые освободят Дух Земли от оков материального существования. Тогда необходимость направлять нас исчезнет.

### <h3 id="question-91">Вопрос 91</h3>

Написано, что «Ибо так возлюбил Бог мир, что отдал Сына Своего Единородного, дабы всякий верующий в Него не погиб, но имел жизнь вечную». Как можно согласовать эту мысль со словами Христа: «Не мир пришел Я принести, но меч»?

Ответ: Написано, что были «закон и пророки до Христа» и существует ныне четыре ступени, по которым человек поднимается к Богу. Во-первых, когда он пробуждается к сознательной жизни в Физическом мире в состоянии дикаря, он обнаруживает, что его окружают другие люди, которые под давлением обстоятельств вынуждены бороться за жизнь и жить по закону «Кто силен, тот и прав». Здесь он обучается полагаться только на свою собственную силу, чтобы спасаться от нападений диких животных и других людей. Но вокруг себя он ощущает силы природы и боится их, так как знает, что они способны убивать и что он сам не может справиться с ними. Поэтому он начинает им поклоняться, пытаясь умиротворить Бога, которого он боится, кровавыми жертвами.

Затем приходит время, когда он начинает воспринимать Бога как подателя всего, который наградит его здесь и сейчас за послушание его законам и немедленно накажет за непослушание. Бог — могущественный союзник против его врагов, но и могущественный враг, к тому же еще более ужасный. И поэтому он поклоняется и приносит животных в жертву из страха и алчности.

Затем приходит этап, когда он обучается поклоняться Богу любви и приносить в жертву себя день за днем на протяжении всей своей жизни для получения награды в будущем состоянии, в которое он должен верить в соответствии со своей религией и которое даже не вполне ему ясно.

В конце концов человек достигнет этапа, когда он осознает свою божественность и будет поступать правильно потому, что это правильно, а не из страха и не для подкупа.

Евреи достигли второго этапа и подчинялись закону, христианская религия постепенно продвигается через третий этап, хотя еще не совсем завершила второй. Мы все подчиняемся законам, созданным Богом и человеком для обуздания нашего тела желаний страхом, но, чтобы духовно продвигаться вперед, с настоящего момента мы должны повышать чувствительность нашего жизненного тела, которое подвластно любви и совсем не осведомлено о законах, управляющих природой желаний.

Чтобы подготовить этот грядущий этап, жрецы, которые опережали по развитию обычных людей, держались обособленно и отдельно от них. Известно, что на Востоке только определенной касте, браминам, разрешалось заходить в храмы и проводить богослужения. Среди евреев только левитам разрешалось приближаться к святому месту; у других народов было так же. Священники всегда были отличным от других классом, им не разрешалось вступать в брак с обычными людьми. Они были обособлены и отделены во всех отношениях.

Так происходило по той причине, что лидеры человечества могли использовать только тех людей, у которых существовало некоторое ослабление связи между жизненным телом и плотным. Они воспитывали этих жрецов и держали их около храмов, регулируя их жизнь сексуально и во всех прочих отношениях. Но когда Христос был освобожден из тела Иисуса и распространил Свое присутствие по всей Земле, «завеса в храме раздралась по средине» как символ того, что необходимость в каких-либо особенных условиях прошла. С этого момента на Земле начал изменяться эфир. Существенно увеличившаяся скорость вибрации дает возможность проявляться альтруистическим качествам. Приход этой новой вибрации вызвал, как написано, спустившуюся тьму во время распятия. Это была совсем не тьма, а интенсивный свет, ослепивший людей на некоторое время, пока вибрации несколько не замедлились в связи с погружением в плотную физическую Землю. Несколькими часами позже сияющий Дух Христа ушел в Землю в достаточной степени, чтобы восстановились нормальные условия. И постепенно эта сила, приходящая изнутри, завоевывает влияние, а эфирные вибрации ускоряются, увеличивая альтруизм и духовный рост. Таким образом, современные условия таковы, что никакой особенный или привилегированный класс не нужен, но каждый и всякий может стремиться встать на путь Посвящения.

Старое и привычное уходит с трудом; при власти Иеговы, Духа Луны, человечество было разбито на нации, и, чтобы Он мог управлять ими, Ему было необходимо время от времени использовать одну нацию для наказания другой, так как человечество тогда не было во власти любви, оно могло подчиняться только под плетью страха. Прежде чем может быть установлено великое всемирное Братство любви, необходимо разрушить эти нации. Ведь когда мы имеем несколько зданий, построенных из кирпичей, и хотим построить одно большое строение, необходимо сначала разъединить их на части, так чтобы каждый маленький кирпич можно было использовать для большого здания. Поэтому Христос сказал: «Не мир пришел Я принести, но меч».

Мы должны перерасти патриотизм и научиться говорить подобно Томасу Пейну, великой душе: «Весь мир — моя страна, и творить добро — моя религия». До этого времени войны должны продолжаться, и чем больше, тем лучше, потому что тогда весь ужас войны станет настолько очевидным, что принудит к миру.

В священную ночь, когда родился младенец Христос, Ангелы пели: «Слава в вышних Богу, и на земле мир, в человеках благоволение». Позже, когда младенец вырос, он сказал: «Не мир пришел Я принести, но меч», и христианская религия стала самой кровавой из всех религий человечества. Куда бы она ни приходила, она несла с собой опустошение и горе, но в результате всех мучений наступит день, когда мечта, воплощенная в песне Ангелов, осуществится и когда-то произнесенные слова Христа о любви к ближнему воплотятся в жизнь. Когда меч завершит свою работу, его перекуют на орала и войн больше не будет, поскольку не будет больше наций.

### <h3 id="question-92">Вопрос 92</h3>

Что подразумевается под вечным спасением и вечными муками?

Ответ: Ортодоксальные религии утверждают, что те, кто вел праведную жизнь, спасутся, то есть отправятся на небо, которое не очень ясно определено, а те, кому не удалось достичь спасения, провалятся в ад, о котором почти ничего неизвестно, кроме того, что это место страдания. Хорошие и плохие занимают соответствующие им места, раз приговор вынесен. Для падших душ нет искупления, а для тех, кто однажды спасен, нет опасности падения.

Такая интерпретация полностью неправильна. Если в качестве авторитетного источника использовать греческий словарь, становится очевидно, что понимание зависит от перевода слова вечный. Это слово — aionian, «эонический», и в словаре оно переводится как «долгий срок, неопределенный период, продолжительность жизни» и так далее. Каков же истинный смысл процитированного отрывка? — можем мы спросить себя. Для того чтобы найти правильное значение, необходимо взглянуть на жизнь с позиции относительности.

В начале проявления Бог, великий свет, выделил огромное количество исходных огней, или искр внутри Себя, не из Себя, поскольку на самом деле «мы Им живем и движемся и существуем». Ничто не может существовать вне Бога. Итак, внутри Себя Бог выделил эти бесчисленные души. Каждая из них потенциально божественна. Каждая из них развивает все Его силы так же, как из семени развивается растение. Но подобно тому, как семя должно быть скрыто землей, чтобы родить растение, так же необходимо, чтобы эти божественные искры были погружены в материальные проводники для постижения уроков, которые могут быть усвоены только при таком разъединенном существовании, которое существует в мире.

Можно считать, что мир — это школа обучения для развивающихся духов. Одни начали рано, приложили старания для выполнения поставленных перед ними задач и, как следствие, развивались быстро. Другие начали позже и очень медлительны. Поэтому они остались позади в этом забеге; но все в конечном счете достигнут совершенства. В свете вышеизложенных фактов существует три класса странствующих духов. И прежде чем одна группа, или класс, духов сможет подняться на одну ступеньку эволюции, необходимо, чтобы они достигли определенного уровня мастерства. Они спасены от низших уровней, которые они переросли. Как только этот уровень умения достигнут, они переходят в другую расу, другую эпоху. Но среди большинства всегда есть отстающие, которые обречены оставаться в том же самом классе, пока они не достигнут уровня роста, необходимого для продвижения. Схема подобна той, по которой дети в школе переводятся в следующий класс более высокого уровня посредством ежегодных экзаменов, которые они сдают, если достигли определенного уровня знаний. А если нет, они обречены остаться позади — не навсегда, но лишь пока следующий ежегодный экзамен не докажет, что они это заслужили.

Вышеизложенное не является искажением или неправильным представлением значения слова aionian. В различных частях Библии это слово употреблялось в значении, подтверждающем наше понимание. Например, в послании Павла к Филимону, где апостол возвращает раба Онисима со словами: «Ибо, может быть, он для того на время отлучился, чтобы тебе принять его навсегда». Слово «навсегда» — это же самое слово «aionian», которое переводится как «вечно» в связи с муками и спасением. Легко видеть, что в данном случае, оно может означать только часть жизненного срока, так как ни Павел, ни Филимон, как таковые, не будут жить вечно.

### <h3 id="question-93">Вопрос 93</h3>

В чем заключается учение розенкрейцеров относительно непорочного зачатия?

Ответ: Учение о непорочном зачатии — это, возможно, самая высочайшая тайна христианской религии, и, возможно, по этой причине она больше всего пострадала от попыток разрушить ее материальными интерпретациями, чем любые другие тайны. Она в равной мере пострадала из-за толкования ее нелепыми приверженцами и от насмешек скептиков. Когда, например, мы видим в церквях изображение Бога как старика, сидящего на небе со стеклодувной трубкой во рту и выдувающего младенца Иисуса в сторону Марии, это более чем нелепо, это печально!

Популярная, но ошибочная идея заключается в том, что более 2000 лет назад человек по имени Иисус Христос был зачат матерью без взаимодействия с земным отцом, и это событие считается единственным в истории мира. На самом деле этот случай не беспримерен; непорочное зачатие имело место в истории мира множество раз и будет всеобщим в будущем.

Будущую историю человека можно прочесть по звездам — человек является малой вселенной подобно тому, как звезды — это огромные миры. Здесь год от года ярко представляется идеальный архетип непорочного зачатия. Солнце — податель жизни миру; оно также и свет миру. И подобно тому, как появляются наиболее передовые существа, спасители человечества, когда на Земле воцаряется глубокая духовная тьма, так же и Солнце снова рождается во время зимнего солнцестояние и начинает свое путешествие к экватору в самую темную ночь года, в ночь с 24 на 25 декабря. В это время зодиакальный знак Девы поднимается над восточным горизонтом по всем северным широтам, самым населенным частям Земли.

Так, каждый год свет миру непорочно зачинается небесной девственной матерью и начинает свое путешествие на север, чтобы отдать свою жизнь человечеству, вызывая созревание пшеницы и винограда. По аналогии духовные учителя рождаются во время сгущения духовной тьмы и дают потом человеку хлеб жизни, питающий душу.

Не собирают с терновника виноград, подобное всегда порождает подобное; низкое существо родится от низкой матери, но прежде чем может родиться Спаситель, должна быть найдена непорочная девственная мать. Но когда мы говорим «девственная», мы не имеем в виду девственность в физическом смысле. У нас у всех есть физическая девственность в первые годы нашей жизни, но девственность духа — это то свойство души, которым можно овладеть, прожив многие жизни с чистыми мыслями и высокими устремлениями. Оно не зависит от состояния тела. Истинная «девственница» может выносить нескольких детей и остаться «девственницей».

Зачат ли ребенок в грехе или зачат непорочно зависит, таким образом, от его собственных врожденных качеств души, так как если Эго надлежит родиться в чистоте и целомудрии, оно, как и следовало ожидать, родится у матери, которая тоже обладает столь же чистой и прекрасной сущностью. А физический акт, который в большинстве случаев для многих людей диктуется страстью и желанием чувственных удовольствий, выполняется из чистоты и целомудрия души в духе молитвы как жертва. Тогда ребенок рождается без греха страсти; он непорочно зачат.

Такой ребенок никогда не рождается случайно. Его приход возвещается и ожидается с предчувствием блаженства и радости. И очень часто в наше время люди очень близко подходят к копированию непорочного зачатия. Часто бывают случаи, когда оба родителя чисты и целомудренны, когда они выполняют акт зачатия в духе чистой любви, когда мать оставлена в покое в период беременности, и ребенок рождается почти так же непорочно, как и предсказано в символическом непорочном зачатии. Со временем, когда человечество будет намного более альтруистичным, чистая любовь вытеснит страсть и зачатие всех людей будет совершаться непорочно.

### <h3 id="question-94">Вопрос 94</h3>

Не была ли Вифлеемская звезда кометой?

Ответ: Нет; Вифлеемская звезда светит каждой ночью в полночь, как она светила ночью согласно записям Библии, и в наши дни ее может увидеть каждый мудрый человек, хотя она скрыта ото всех остальных.

Вот ключ к тайне:

Евангелия — это не просто рассказы о жизни индивидуума; они изображают ярко и в символической манере основные события на пути духовного восхождения; они являются формулой Посвящения.

Летом, когда вся Земля прилагает усилия, чтобы произвести хлеб жизни для всех, кто на ней живет, Солнце находится высоко в небе, посылая свои жизнедательные лучи нашей планете. Тогда на передний план выступает физическая деятельность и человек с головой уходит в материальную работу, необходимую для его существования. Но зимой, когда Солнце находится ниже небесного экватора и природа дремлет, духовные влияния, посылаемые Солнцем, — самые сильные. Когда возрастает физическая тьма, духовный свет горит ярче и достигает своей высшей точки в день рождения Спасителей, в самую темную ночь года между двадцать четвертым и двадцать пятым декабря. В это время Солнце начинает свой путь на север, чтобы спасти человечество от голода и холода, которые безусловно последовали бы, если бы Солнце осталось в южных широтах.

В эту особенную ночь года духовные вибрации самые сильные. Эта ночь — действительно Святая Ночь года. В эту ночь неофиту легче всего войти в сознательный контакт с духовными вибрациями. Поэтому существовал обычай брать неофитов в храм накануне Святой Ночи. Они входили туда в сопровождении мудрецов и обучались сознательно выходить из своих тел по собственной воле. Тогда Земля становилась прозрачной для их взора и они видели за ней полночное Солнце — ослепительную звезду. Конечно, это было не физическое Солнце, а духовное Солнце, которое является настоящей звездой-Христом, так как космический Христос — самый высокий Посвященный среди светящихся солнечных духов, Архангелов.

### <h3 id="question-95">Вопрос 95</h3>

Какими были дары мудрецов?

Ответ: В Библии написано, что это были золото, ладан и смирна. В древних легендах и символике золото всегда считалось символом духа. В рассказе о Кольце Нибелунгов, инсценированном Вагнером, говорится о том, как девы Рейна играли в своей водной стихии на дне реки Рейн. Вода светилась от яркого света золота. Эта легенда возвращает нас в то время, когда дети тумана жили в прекрасных условиях ранней Атлантиды, когда люди были одним большим братством и Универсальный Дух еще не спускался в разделенные тела.

Золото, оставшееся на дне реки, было символом Универсального Духа, освящавшего все человечество. Позже оно было украдено и переплавлено в кольцо Альберихом, Нибелунгом, отрекшимся от любви ради обладания этим золотом. И тогда оно становится символом разделенного Эго в современном веке эгоизма, где отсутствует любовь. Человек, ставший мудрецом, видящий пороки эгоизма, предлагает золото Христу как символ своего огромного желания вернуться к Универсальному Духу любви.

Следующий дар, смирна, — ароматическое растение, растущее в Аравии, очень редкое и немногочисленное. В легендах о святых говорится, что они были так святы, что испускали аромат. Считается, что это религиозный миф, но на самом деле человек может стать святым настолько, что будет испускать необыкновенно прекрасное благоухание.

Третий дар, ладан, является символом плотного тела, которое стало эфирным благодаря святой жизни, так как ладан — это род физического испарения. Министр внутренних дел Сербии, один из заговорщиков, планировавших цареубийство в своей стране около десяти лет назад, впоследствии написал мемуары. Согласно его записям оказалось, что когда при встречах с приглашенными людьми, которых они хотели вовлечь в заговор, зажигали благовония, им непременно удавалось привлечь на свою сторону того, кого они хотели. Он не знал почему, просто упоминал об этом как о необычном совпадении. Но для эзотерика причина очевидна.

Ни один дух не может работать ни в одном мире без проводника, сделанного из материала этого мира. Чтобы действовать в Физическом мире, добиваться и увлекать за собой, необходимо плотное тело и жизненное тело; эти тела созданы из физической материи различного уровня: твердого вещества, жидкости, газа и эфира. Можно получить эти проводники обычным путем, родившись через чрево, или можно изгнать эфир из тела медиума и временно использовать это тело для материализации. Можно также использовать дым благовоний. В католической церкви, где вызываются определенные духи, из благовоний создается проводник, посредством которого эти духи могут воздействовать на собравшихся прихожан, как это делали развоплощенные духи для сербских заговорщиков.

Таким образом, мы видим, что дары мудрецов — это дух, душа и тело, отданные для служения человечеству. Принести себя в дар означает подражать Христу, следовать по Его стопам.

### <h3 id="question-96">Вопрос 96</h3>

Иисус был евреем, не так ли? Если так, что он имел в виду, говоря: «Прежде нежели был Авраам, Я есмь». Даже если он перевоплотился, Авраам был отцом еврейской расы.

Ответ: В давние времена и даже в наши дни патриотизм считается важнейшей добродетелью, но с эзотерической точки зрения существует, конечно, только единый Дух, а расы есть не что иное, как мимолетная фаза в схеме эволюции. На самом деле это очень опасная фаза. Тогда как в течение периодов и больших эпох эволюции есть избыток времени и лидеры эволюции могут выровнять большинство духов для продвижения, расы и нации рождаются и умирают за такое относительно короткое время, что есть большая опасность, что духи могут привязаться к расовым телам и не последовать за большей частью человечества в его движении вперед.

Именно это и произошло с евреями. Они были в столь высокой степени патриотичны, что ни один еврей не воспринимал себя как индивидуальность. Во-первых, используя высокий слог, он сказал бы о себе как о «семени Авраама». Во-вторых, он считает, что принадлежит к определенному колену, и, наконец, возможно, он был Соломоном Леви или Моисеем Коэном.

Христос сражался с этой идеей тождественности расе, когда говорил: «Прежде нежели был Авраам, Я есмь». Эго существовало до Авраама; Авраам был воплощением Эго, Духа. Он и еврейская раса, происшедшая от него, были всего лишь телами, но Эго, населявшие их, существовали до расы тел. Так Христос советовал своим слушателям переключить внимание с преходящего на вечное.

В другом месте Он говорит: «Кто любит отца или мать более, нежели Меня, не достоин Меня... И всякий, кто оставит... отца, или мать, ради имени Моего, получит во сто крат и наследует жизнь вечную». Отец и мать — тоже расовые тела. Мы не имеем права оставлять зависящих от нас родственников, чтобы следовать высшей жизни. Мы должны исполнить все свои обязанности здесь, прежде чем эгоистично браться за изучение высшей жизни, но нам не следует отождествлять себя с расой, нацией и семьей, в которых мы родились. Каждый из нас является индивидуальным духом, который существовал до тел, называемых расами, и будет существовать после того, как они прекратят свое существование. Забыв об этом, мы можем закристаллизоваться и остаться с расой, вместо того чтобы двигаться вперед. Именно так поступили евреи. Их чересчур сильный патриотизм привел к тому, что их духи перевоплощаются в еврейские расовые тела тысячелетиями.

Лидеры человечества разными способами пытались заставить их слиться с другими, чтобы они могли продвигаться вперед, но всегда безрезультатно, и Христос был послан к ним за тем же, за чем Букер Т. Вашингтон был послан к неграм. Будучи гораздо дальше ушедшей вперед душой, чем его братья по расе, он воплотился в тело чернокожего, чтобы эффективнее помогать неграм. Если бы он воплотился в белого человека, то всегда казалось бы, что существуют покровительственные отношения. Те же причины обусловили рождение Христа в еврейском теле. Была надежда, что они примут Его учение, как исходившее от представителя своей расы. Но вместо почитания традиций и благоговейного отношения к Аврааму Он свергал их идеалы, Он говорил о Новом Небе и Новой Земле, Он заявлял о преимуществе индивидуума перед расой, и поэтому они ничего не восприняли от Него — они выбрали Варавву.

### <h3 id="question-97">Вопрос 97</h3>

Иисус был крещен в тридцать лет, обретя «Дух Христов». Пожалуйста, объясните это крещение.

Ответ: Земля не всегда была такой, какая она сейчас. Наука сообщает нам, что было время, когда она была смешанным огненным туманом. Библия идет даже дальше, в ней написано о времени, предшествовавшем этому туману, когда Земля была раскаленной и светящейся как огонь, — о времени, когда царствовала тьма.

Всего было четыре эпохи, или этапа, развития Земли. Первым был уже упомянутый этап тьмы, который в терминологии розенкрейцеров называется Полярной эпохой. Тогда вещество, которое сейчас образует Землю, было темной массой, горячей и газообразной. На втором этапе, называемом Гиперборейской эпохой, эта темная масса воспламенилась. Написано: «И сказал Бог: да будет свет. И стал свет». Потом пришел этап, когда жар огненного тумана при взаимодействии с холодным пространством породил влагу. Эта влага была плотнее всего около огненного ядра, где она нагревалась и переходила в пар, стремившийся наружу от центра. Бог «отделил воду... от воды», то есть плотную воду около ядра от легкого пара снаружи. В конце концов произошло образование коры, как это обычно бывает, если вода постоянно кипит, и таким образом сформировалась земная кора, суша.

Когда образование земной коры было завершено, на поверхности Земли не было воды, но согласно Библии «пар поднимался с земли». Растения еще не росли на поверхности Земли, но подобие растительности тем не менее начало появляться. В этих условиях жило и зарождающееся человечество. Люди по своему строению были не такими, какими являемся мы сейчас. У них была совершенно другая форма, они не были так развиты, как мы. Дух и тело еще не были в совершенном контакте друг с другом. Дух частично парил снаружи, и поэтому «глаза человека еще не были открыты».

Старинные народные предания, которые еще можно услышать в Германии и других частях Старого Света, рассказывают о людях того времени как о Нибелунгах. Niebel означает туман, а ungen — дети.

Они были детьми тумана, поскольку такой ясной атмосферы, как сейчас, тогда не существовало. Солнце выглядело как уличный фонарь в очень туманный день по причине плотного тумана, поднимавшегося из Земли.

Пока человечество жило в таком состоянии, оно не было так развито умственно, как мы сейчас. Люди не были способны видеть что-либо вне самих себя, но они обладали внутренним восприятием. Они видели душевные качества всех, кто их окружал, и ощущали себя в большей степени духовными существами, чем материальными. В те времена совсем не было наций и человечество было одним большим братством. Все находились частично вне своих тел и потому в соприкосновении с Единым Духом, который в наши дни ослабел из-за разделенности, вызванной эгоизмом. Эгоизм служит причиной того, что каждый чувствует себя отличным от других и отдельным ото всего остального человечества; поэтому братство забыто и правит эгоизм.

Если кто-либо продвигается вперед настолько, что может оценить счастье братства, в котором он старается уничтожить эгоизм и развивать альтруизм, он может совершить обряд крещения. Он погружается в воду, символ идеальных условий братства, которые существовали, когда все человечество жило, так сказать, в воде. Поэтому мы видим, что Иисус, вестник всеобщего Братства, в начале своего служения погружается в воды Иордана и там получает крещение. Когда он поднимается из вод, на Него нисходит Универсальный Дух в виде голубя, и начиная с этого момента Он уже не просто Иисус, а Иисус Христос, потенциальный Спаситель мира, проникнутый Универсальным Духом, который безусловно уничтожит все пороки эгоизма и возвратит человечество к благословению братства, которое будет осуществлено, когда Универсальный Дух станет присущим всему человечеству.

### <h3 id="question-98">Вопрос 98</h3>

В своем учении вы утверждаете, что мы остаемся на время, равное примерно одной трети длительности нашей земной жизни, в чистилище для искоренения грехов, прежде чем попасть на Небо. Как тогда вы можете согласовать это учение со словами Христа умирающему разбойнику: «Истинно говорю тебе, ныне же будешь со Мною в раю»?

Ответ: Новый Завет был написан по-гречески, на языке, в котором не использовалась пунктуация. Знаки препинания в нашу Библию были введены позднее переводчиками Библии. А знаки препинания иногда очень сильно изменяют смысл предложения. В этой связи широко известен пример с фразой «Казнить нельзя помиловать», где иная постановка запятой меняет смысл на противоположный.

В данном случае, если слова Христа прочесть так: «Истинно говорю тебе ныне, будешь со Мною в раю», они означают, что разбойник будет с Христом в каком-то неопределенном будущем. Но поскольку запятая в Библии поставлена перед словом «ныне», это предполагает тот смысл, который сегодня общепринят.

Но подобное понимание абсолютно неверно, что можно заключить из замечания Христа сразу после распятия, когда он говорит женщине: «Не прикасайся ко Мне, ибо Я еще не восшел к Отцу Моему». Если Он обещал разбойнику, что будет с ним в раю в день распятия и три дня спустя объявил, что Он еще не там, Христа можно было бы обвинить в противоречии, что, безусловно, невозможно. Если поместить запятую, как было предложено, то оба отрывка полностью согласуются. Кроме того, Петр говорит, что в течение трех дней Христос работал с духами в чистилище.

### <h3 id="question-99">Вопрос 99</h3>

В чем эзотерический смысл пребывания двух разбойников на кресте?
Ответ: В противовес общепринятому мнению, четыре Евангелия совсем не являются биографией Иисуса Христа. Они являются формулами Посвящения четырех различных школ Мистерий, и, чтобы скрыть их эзотерический смысл, жизнь и служение Христа также были смешаны. Подобное смешение легко осуществимо, так как все Посвященные, являясь космическими существами, обладают схожим опытом. Правильно говорят, что для большинства людей Христос использовал иносказания, а скрытое значение передавалось только Его ученикам наедине. Апостол Павел также питал молоком младенцев, а твердой пищей — совершенных. Всегда, во все времена, скрытые символы не предназначались для обычных людей, и никогда не предполагалось сделать Библию «открытой книгой», как сейчас полагают люди.

Если читать в памяти Природы, мы обнаружим, что во время распятия было не двое, но несколько распятых людей. Людям того времени назначали это тяжкое наказание за малейший проступок, и всегда много было таких, кому приходилось расплачиваться смертью из-за подобного варварства. Итак, тот, кто хотел скрыть тайное значение Евангелий, без труда мог найти что-то, чтобы добавить в рассказ и затуманить смысл распятия, которое действительно имеет жизненно важное значение. Поэтому часть сюжета, рассказывающая о разбойниках, является реальным событием, не имеющим никакого эзотерического значения.

### <h3 id="question-100">Вопрос 100</h3>

В чем значение креста? Является ли он просто инструментом мучительной казни, как обычно учит ортодоксальная религия?

Ответ: Как и у всех других символов, у креста много значений. Платон дает одно из этих значений, говоря: «Мировая Душа распята». И это значит, что в мире есть четыре царства — минеральное, растительное, животное и человеческое.

Минеральное царство одушевляет все химические вещества любого вида, поэтому весь крест, из какого бы материала он ни был сделан, в первую очередь является символом этого царства.

Нижний вертикальный конец креста является символом растительного царства, потому что потоки Групповых Духов, дающих растениям жизнь, идут из центра Земли, где эти Групповые Духи размещаются, устремляясь к периферии нашей планеты и в космос.

Верхний конец креста символизирует человека, потому что жизненные потоки человеческого царства проходят сверху вниз от Солнца через вертикаль позвоночника. Таким образом, человек — это перевернутое растение, так как растение получает пищу через корень, пропуская ее вверх, а человек питается через голову, пропуская пищу вниз. Растение непорочно, чисто и бесстрастно и вытягивает свой орган воспроизведения, цветок, целомудренно и без всякого стыда к Солнцу, создание красоты и восхищения. Человек направляет свои полные страсти органы воспроизведения к Земле. Человек вдыхает дающий жизнь кислород и выдыхает ядовитый углекислый газ. Растение берет выдыхаемые человеком яды и строит из них свое тело, возвращая нам эликсир жизни, очищенный кислород.

Между царством растений и человека находится животное царство, населяемое существами с горизонтальным позвоночником, и в их горизонтальном позвоночнике жизненные потоки Группового Духа животных движутся так же, как они циркулируют вокруг нашего глобуса. Поэтому горизонтальная перекладина креста является символом царства животных.

В эзотерике крест никогда не рассматривался как инструмент пытки, и распятый Христос стал изображаться на картинах только в шестом веке. До этого времени символом Христа были крест и ягненок, расположившийся у его подножия. Это символизировало ту мысль, что во время рождения Христа Солнце в точке весеннего равноденствия пересекало экватор в знаке Овна, Агнца. Символы различных религий всегда создавались подобным образом. В те времена, когда в своем движении Солнце пересекало экватор в точке весеннего равноденствия в знаке Тельца, Быка, в Египте была основана религия, требующая поклонения Быку Апису так же, как теперь мы почитаем Агнца Божьего. Еще раньше, как нам известно, северный Бог Тор перегонял своих козочек-близнецов по небу. В это время точка весеннего равноденствия находилась в знаке Близнецов. В момент рождения Христа точка весеннего равноденствия располагалась в 7-м градусе Овна, Агнца, поэтому наш спаситель называется Агнец Божий. В первые века спорили о правомерности того, чтобы сделать ягненка символом нашего Спасителя. Некоторые утверждали, что точка весеннего равноденствия в момент Его рождения на самом деле была в знаке Рыб и что символом нашего Спасителя должна быть рыба. Об этом споре напоминает митра епископа, до сих пор имеющая форму головы рыбы.

### <h3 id="question-101">Вопрос 101</h3>

Не могла ли миссия Христа быть завершена без такого радикального средства, как распятие?

Ответ: Конечно, она могла бы быть завершена и без такого необычного способа, как распятие, но было абсолютно необходимо, чтобы пролилась кровь. Существуют Учителя разных уровней, и все они требуют определенных условий для завершения своей работы. Такие Учителя, как Моисей и Будда, пришли к своему народу и помогли ему до определенной степени, сами развиваясь посредством этой работы. Оба эти Учителя достигли такой точки своего собственного развития, в которой их тела стали светящимися. Мы знаем, что лицо Моисея светилось так, что приходилось использовать покрывало. Будда стал светящимся в момент своей смерти. Христос достиг ступени свечения во время своего Преображения, и очень важно, что основная часть Его работы, Его страдания и смерть имели место после Преображения. И в то время как Моисею, Илии, Будде и другим Учителям было необходимо рождаться в физическом теле опять и опять, чтобы нести грехи своего народа, Христос появился в физическом теле только однажды, и Ему больше не понадобится пользоваться этим инструментом. Если дух покидает тело естественным путем, к нему примешивается определенная грязь, так как его выход из свертывающейся крови происходит медленно. Даже в таком чистом теле, как тело Иисуса, были загрязнения, но жестокая смерть, которая привела к кровопролитию, освободила Эго Христа от крови сразу, освобождаясь от всевозможных загрязнений, так что Христос вышел из тела Иисуса незапятнанным и без кармических узлов, обычно нарабатываемых в течение жизни в плотном теле.

Точно так же обстоит дело с войнами, о которых стоит сожалеть с обычной человеческой точки зрения. Но на самом деле, и это очевидно эзотерику, эти войны существенно очистили кровь расы, так что постепенно человечество становится все менее страстным и более духовным. Можно также сказать, что войны служат искуплением убийства животных. Когда человечество проходило стадию животных, у него не было тех страстных, кровавых инстинктов, заполняющих кровь наших животных; мы не были так высоко развиты. Современные животные хотя и идут позади нас в эволюции, находятся на более высоком витке спирали, и в то время как мы сейчас страдаем, подпадая под действие закона Следствий, потому что нам надо преодолевать наши страсти своими силами, животным помогают: их ведут под контролем Групповые Духи. И когда они достигнут этапа человечества в период Юпитера, они станут более высоким человечеством, свободным от страстей, которые делают этот мир столь печальным местом. Так природа всегда преобразует в высшее добро любой грех, который мы совершили.

Отвечая на вопрос, мы можем поэтому сказать, что в случае Христа жестокая смерть была необходима, поскольку она дала возможность Духу Христа выйти из тела Иисуса без загрязнений, свойственных только человеческому проводнику.

### <h3 id="question-102">Вопрос 102</h3>

Когда в соответствии с учением розенкрейцеров опять придет Христос?

Ответ: В Библии правильно написано, что «о дне же том, или часе, никто не знает». А те люди, которые пытались установить определенную дату или определенный год второго пришествия, абсолютно не поняли цель миссии Христа не Земле. Его учение было дано человечеству, чтобы был уничтожен закон «око за око и зуб за зуб», чтобы закон страха (Божьего) был поглощен законом любви. Сказано, что «закон и пророки» были до Христа, но мы знаем, что даже сегодня закон существует и он необходим. Поэтому очевидно, что закон не был отменен при физическом пришествии Христа. Именно пришествие Христа «внутрь», во внутреннюю природу человека, должно отменить закон. Апостол Павел говорит об этом пришествии как о времени, когда «изобразится в вас Христос», и, пока Христос не изобразится в нас, мы не готовы ко второму пришествию. Ангелий Силезский пишет:

    Хотя б Христос и сотню раз рождался в Вифлееме,  
    Но не в тебе — твоя душа пропала.  
    На Крест Голгофы смотришь зря  
    Коль не воздвиг его внутри себя.  
  
Второе пришествие Христа зависит от того, как скоро достаточное количество людей станут подобными Христу и будут созвучными принципу Христа подобно тому, как камертоны одинакового тона звучат вместе, когда ударяют по одному из них. Такие люди будут способны откликаться на вибрации Христа, которые установятся с приходом Спасителя. Поэтому это событие нельзя рассчитать. Каждый раз, когда мы пытаемся подражать Христу и осуществлять Его учение, мы приближаем Его пришествие; так будем же прилагать для этого усилия.

### <h3 id="question-103">Вопрос 103</h3>

Что означают слова: «Христос был сделан Первосвященником вовек по чину Мелхиседека?»

Ответ: Написано, что Мелхиседек — царь Салима, священник Бога Всевышнего. Написано, что его священство было гораздо более высоким, чем у Аарона, ибо «Сей, как пребывающий вечно, имеет и священство непреходящее», тогда как священство Аарона и левитов было подвержено частым сменам.

На протяжении времени, о котором существуют исторические записи, всегда было разделение на светские и духовные власти. Моисей был светским лидером и правителем еврейского народа, а Аарон был священником, который следил за духовным благополучием народа. И на протяжении веков это разделение церкви и государства всегда было заметным; временами оно приводило к раздорам и кровопролитию, так как их интересы, казалось, всегда были диаметрально противоположными. Но во времена упомянутого Мелхиседека, царя Салема, что в переводе означает «мир», не было подобного разделения, две функции исполнялись одним лицом. Сюжет о Мельхиседеке, Существе без земной родословной, относится, безусловно, ко временам ранней Атлантиды, когда человечество не было еще разделено на воюющие нации, а было одним большим мирным братством и водителями человечества были Божественные Существа, которые исполняли роль как царей, так и священников.

Позднейшее разделение церкви и государства было одним из наиболее мощных источников вражды и войны человечества, так как каждая из этих сил боролась за превосходство над другой. На самом деле не должно было быть никакого предубеждения, ибо тот, кто не является достаточно духовным, чтобы быть священником, не подходит и для роли царя, а тот, кто не обладает мудростью и справедливостью царя, не подходит для духовного водительства человечества, за которое ответственно духовенство. Когда эти свойства опять объединятся в одном лидере, господство всеобщего мира и братства станет реальностью. Было предсказано, что Христос будет именно таким лидером, способным объединить церковь и государство как царь и священник по чину Мелхиседека. Его второе пришествие ознаменует тысячелетнее царство Христа, век мира и радости, в котором символический Новый Иерусалим, город мира (так как Иер-у-салим означает «будет мир») царствует над всеми нациями на Земле, объединенными в одно всеобщее Братство. На Земле будет мир и благоволение среди людей.

### <h3 id="question-104">Вопрос 104</h3>

Что имел в виду Христос, когда говорил: «Все, сколько их ни приходило предо Мною, суть воры и разбойники»?

Ответ: В Библии мы читаем о двух великих городах удивительно похожих, но абсолютно противоположных. Один из городов — Вавилон, место рождения беспорядка, где люди собирались стать братьями и разделились. Он лежит на семи холмах у реки и управляется царем Люцифером, «дневной звездой», дарителем огня. Его падение с небес горестно оплакивается в четырнадцатой главе Исаии, и позже мы узнаем о падении этого великого города, который становится мерзостью и назван блудницей, так как вызвал на Земле войны, несчастья и опустошения.
Далее в качестве высшего противопоставления рассказывается о другом городе, называемом Новым Иерусалимом, который занимает почетное место моста. В городе уже нет текущей реки, а есть море стеклянное. Он также лежит на семи холмах и управляется другим дарителем света, который зовется «светом миру». И этот город — город мира, в котором никогда не закрываются ворота, хотя там находится драгоценное дерево жизни. Город сей не принадлежит этому миру, а сошел с небес.

Чтобы понять данную символику, необходимо вернуться в отдаленное прошлое, когда человек-в-становлении еще не достиг такого развития, как сейчас. После того как мы впервые пришли на Землю, в Полярную эпоху было построено плотное тело, которое было оживлено проникновением в него жизненного тела в Гиперборейскую эпоху. В это время человек был подобен Ангелам, он был мужчиной-женщиной, полной творческой единицей, способной творить из самого себя, проецируя свою целостную творческую силу, которая есть любовь.

Позже человеку понадобилось развивать мозг, и, для того чтобы создать этот объект, половина его созидательной силы была повернута внутрь, чтобы построить необходимые органы. Начиная с этого момента человек доложен был искать взаимодействия с обладателем другой половины сексуальной силы, пригодной для воспроизведения. Теперь он стал любить эгоистично для достижения взаимодействия с другой творческой единицей с целью воспроизведения. С помощью другой половины своей созидательной силы он построил свой мозг и гортань, которые он так же эгоистично использует, чтобы думать и говорить, потому что страстно хочет получать знания.

Прежде человек проецировал всю свою созидательную силу, ничего не оставляя, бескорыстно. После разделения полов человек в итоге стал эгоистом и по закону притяжения — жертвой других, обладающих подобной природой.

Ангелы были человечеством периода Луны и с того времени смогли сильно развиться, но как в любом обществе существуют отстающие, так и среди Ангелов были такие, которые не достигли необходимого развития. Так возник класс существ, находившихся позади Ангелов, но впереди человечества. Они оказались в печальном положении, поскольку, с одной стороны, не могли следовать настоящему развитию Ангелов и, с другой стороны, не могли погрузиться так глубоко в материю, как погрузился человек. Они не могли, как Ангелы, обходиться без мозга, однако они не были способны построить его для себя, поэтому, когда у человечества развился головной и спинной мозг, они усмотрели в этом удобный случай использовать женщину, которая выражает отрицательный полюс созидательной силы, воображение, способность, позволяющую ей строить тело в своем лоне. Чтобы получить доступ к ее сознанию, эти разумные существа воспользовались ее растерянностью и затем растревожили ее способность к воображению.

В то время глаза человека не были еще открыты; он был духовным существом и не совсем осознавал, что обладает физическим телом. Женщина первой неясно увидела, что она и другие обладают таким инструментом. Она увидела, что в определенное время некоторые из ее ближних, у которых, как она почувствовала раньше, был физический инструмент, теряют его. Поэтому она забеспокоилась. От Ангелов она не могла получить информацию, но эти разумные существа, которые появились внутри нее в змеевидном спинном мозге, просветили ее. «И сказал змей жене: подлинно ли сказал Бог: не ешьте ни от какого дерева в раю?» Она ему ответила: «Плоды с дерев мы можем есть, только плодов дерева, которое среди рая, сказал Бог, не ешьте их и не прикасайтесь к ним, чтобы вам не умереть». Но змей возразил: «Нет, не умрете, но знает Бог, что в день, в который вы вкусите их, откроются глаза ваши, и вы будете, как боги, знающие добро и зло». Женщина добилась связи с мужчиной в соответствии с наставлениями Люцифера, дарителя огня, и с этого момента их глаза открылись, они узнали добро и зло. Но до этого времени человек не осознавал, что обладает телом; оно спадало с него время от времени, как лист опадает с дерева, не доставляя ему никакого неудобства и беспокойства, так как его внимание было сфокусировано все время на Духовном мире. Но Духи Люцифера жаждали над ним власти, опоры в головном и спинном мозге. Они побуждали его порвать связь с Ангелами и взять созидательную функцию в свои руки. От частого использования и невежественного злоупотребления этой способностью сознание человека было выведено из Духовного мира и сфокусировалось на мире Физическом. Затем появилась смерть со всеми ее нынешними ужасными свойствами, так как человек считает, что эта земная жизнь является единственно реальной жизнью. Когда она кончается, он вступает в существование, о котором он ничего не знает и которого он, следовательно, боится.

Так, из-за того, что человек послушался Люцифера, ложного дарителя света, он стал подвержен страданию, боли и смерти. Он был лишен своей невинности и спокойствия. Христос пришел в мир, чтобы спасти человечество от греха, страдания и смерти. Поэтому Он называл Себя истинным светом, а других, которые приходили до него, он охарактеризовал как воров и разбойников, так как они лишили человека духовного видения, хотя и просветили его в области физических ощущений.

### <h3 id="question-105">Вопрос 105</h3>

Что Христос имел в виду, говоря: «Кто не примет Царствия Божия, как дитя, тот не войдет в него»?

Ответ: В окружающем нас мире мы видим царство человека, где каждый пытается удержать свою собственную позицию, полагаться только на свои взгляды и отстаивать свое право придерживаться своей позиции вопреки всем вновь появляющимся. Когда ему преподносится что-нибудь новое, он обычно полон скептицизма. Он боится быть обманутым.

Позиция ребенка по отношению к тому, что он видит или слышит, абсолютно противоположна позиции взрослого. У маленького ребенка нет подавляющего чувства собственных превосходящих знаний, он искренне невежествен и потому в высшей степени обучаем. Именно это свойство Спаситель и упоминал в процитированном отрывке.

Когда мы вступаем в высшую жизнь, в первую очередь нам надо забыть все, что мы знали в миру. Нам нужно начать смотреть на вещи совершенно иным образом. И когда перед нами предстает новое учение, мы должны постараться принять его, несмотря на другие, ранее известные факты. Это необходимо для того, чтобы мы были абсолютно беспристрастны. Конечно, не предполагается, что мы тотчас поверим, что «черное является белым», но, если кто-то серьезно утверждает, что объект, который мы до настоящего времени считали черным, является белым, нам следует непредвзято рассмотреть вопрос, чтобы избежать поспешных суждений и высказываний типа: «А я уверен, что этот объект черный». Мы должны проявить желание повторно рассмотреть объект, чтобы убедиться, что не может существовать точки зрения, с которой то, что мы считали черным, оказывается белым. Только после того как мы провели тщательное исследование и обнаружили, что этот объект действительно черный с любой точки зрения, мы можем возвращаться к нашему прежнему мнению.

Самое замечательное качество ребенка — это его гибкое мировосприятие, позволяющее ему быть столь обучаемым, и ученик, стремящийся жить высшей жизнью, должен постоянно сохранять ум в подвижном состоянии, ибо, как только наши взгляды застывают и теряют способность меняться, наше продвижение вперед останавливается. В этом заключалась великая истина, которую Христос пытался донести до своих слушателей, когда сделал замечание, вызвавшее вопрос.

### <h3 id="question-106">Вопрос 106</h3>

Иисус ел рыбу, не так ли? Почему тогда розенкрейцеры — вегетарианцы?

Ответ: После Вознесения Христос один раз появился среди своих учеников, когда они были в запертой комнате. Сначала они не узнали Его и не поверили, что его тело было материальным. Но проводник, в котором он появился, был жизненным телом Иисуса, и Он мог, как и любое другое существо, способное функционировать в этом проводнике, стягивать вокруг Себя вещество из химического слоя и строить абсолютно вещественное плотное тело в одно мгновение. Чтобы убедить учеников, что Он был таким, как всегда, Он попросил что-нибудь поесть, и «они подали Ему часть печеной рыбы и сотового меда». Говорится, что он ел, но не говорится, что он ел рыбу, и тот, кто был воспитан среди строгих вегетарианцев, таких, как ессеи, никогда бы не стал есть рыбу, как никогда не стал бы есть поставленное перед ним мясо.

Также рассказывают, будто Будда умер, объевшись мяса вепря. Подобное смешно слышать всякому, кто знает, что Будда обучал своих учеников простой и не наносящей вред жизни: поддерживать тело самой чистой и лучшей пищей, которая непосредственно выходит из земли, и что он испытывал страдание при виде мучений человека или зверя. Ученик-эзотерик понимает, что в древности вепрь был символом эзотерических знаний. Можно делиться своими знаниями, поскольку, чем больше мы отдаем, тем больше получаем; по крайней мере, наше знание не убывает. Эта истина была преподана в символах норвежской мифологии: в Валгалле воины, которые доблестно сражались, пируют за столами с мясом вепря, которое обладало способностью нарастать заново после того, как кто-нибудь отрезал его часть, так что оно всегда было в изобилии, независимо от того, сколько было съедено и сколько человек ело. В этой земной жизни Будда наелся тайного знания, и, когда он умер, он был полон им.

Тем не менее представления спрашивающего не совсем верны. Розенкрейцеры не настаивают, чтобы все стали вегетарианцами сразу. В действительности они учат тому, что вегетарианская диета порождает избыток энергии, гораздо больший, чем мясная пища. Эта энергия не только физическая, но и духовная. Так, если человек ведет сидячий образ жизни и имеет предрасположенность к материальному, а возможно, и вовлечен в грязный бизнес или другие чисто материальные дела, эта духовная энергия может не найти выхода и способна вызвать нарушения во всем организме. Только те, кто живет активной, вне стен дома, жизнью, когда избыток энергии, произведенный вегетарианской пищей, может быть израсходован, или те, кто преобразует эту энергию в духовные устремления, могут благоденствовать на вегетарианской пище. Сверх того, мы обнаружили, что наследственность многих поколений сделала человека частично плотоядным, поэтому для большинства людей переход от смешанного питания к вегетарианскому должен быть постепенным. Диета, которая подходит одному, не подходит другому, вспомним старую поговорку: «Что одному во благо, то другому — отрава», и никакие строгие и скорые правила не приложимы ко всем в равной мере. Поэтому все, что мы едим, как и все остальное, что касается лично нас, должно быть определено нами индивидуально.

Правильно сказано в Библии, что «не то, что входит в уста, оскверняет человека». Если мы жаждем тошнотворной пищи и потворствуем себе в этом, именно это страстное желание является грехом, а не сама пища. Если человек оказался в ситуации, когда он не может достать чистой пищи, которой он действительно жаждет, он может взять ту пищу, которая есть, даже мясную пищу, без отвращения, с такой же благодарностью, с которой он принимает чистую пищу. Это не осквернит его благодаря такому отношению.

### <h3 id="question-107">Вопрос 107</h3>

Если Христос накормил толпу рыбой, почему тогда мы не можем употреблять ее или даже мясо в качестве пищи?

Ответ: В природе хищного зверя заложено поедать любое попавшееся ему на пути животное, и его органы таковы, что оно должно употреблять подобную пищу, чтобы существовать. Но все находится на определенном этапе становления и всегда изменяется, становясь чем-то высшим. Человек на более ранних этапах развития был также подобен хищному животному в определенном отношении; однако он находится на пути к богоподобию и потому в какой-то момент должен прекратить разрушать для того, чтобы начать созидать. Евреи времен Христа все еще были в таком положении, когда их животная природа была чрезвычайно сильна, а представления об альтруизме — чрезвычайно скудными. Они крепко держались закона «око за око и зуб за зуб» и ни в каком отношении не были милосердны. Мы прошли по пути эволюции несколько дальше, и альтруизм у нас все больше и больше выходит на передний план.

Нас учили, что во вселенной нет другой жизни, кроме жизни Бога. Что «мы Им живем и движемся и существуем». Что Его жизнь оживляет все сущее, и поэтому мы естественным образом понимаем, что, лишая кого-то жизни, мы разрушаем форму, построенную Богом для Его проявления. Низшие животные являются развивающимися духами, которые обладают чувствительностью. Именно их жажда опыта привела к тому, что они построили свои различные формы, и, когда мы отбираем у них формы, мы лишаем их возможности приобрести опыт. Мы задерживаем их эволюцию вместо того, чтобы им помогать. Это простительно лишь для каннибала, который не знает ничего лучшего, как поедать своего ближнего. Сейчас мы рассматриваем каннибализм как нечто ужасное, и наступит день, когда мы будем чувствовать такое же отвращение при мысли о том, чтобы превратить наши желудки в кладбище для туш убитых животных.

Естественно, что мы хотим самой лучшей пищи, но каждое тело животного содержит яды гниения. Венозная кровь заполняется двуокисью углерода и другими вредными продуктами по пути к почкам или порам кожи для удаления в виде мочи или пота. Эти тошнотворные вещества находятся в каждой частичке мяса, и, если мы поедаем такую пищу, мы наполняем собственные тела токсичными веществами. Большинство недомоганий происходит из-за употребления мясной пищи.

Когда мы взываем к авторитету Библии для подтверждения мясоедства, мы должны также последовать ее предписаниям и перестать есть свинину, самую ужасную пищу. Примечательно, что ортодоксальные евреи, воздерживающиеся от запрещенной Библией пищи, не болеют туберкулезом и раком.

В большом количестве мест, где Библия говорит о «мясе», легко понять, что мясная пища не имеется в виду. В первой главе Книги Бытия, где человеку впервые предписывается пища, говорится: «Я дал вам всякую траву, сеющую семя, какая есть на всей земле, и всякое дерево, у которого плод древесный, сеющий семя; — вам сие будет в пищу». Самые развитые люди во все времена воздерживались от употребления мясной пищи. Мы видим, например, что пророк Даниил, который был святым и мудрым человеком, молит, чтобы ему не пришлось есть мясо, а чтобы его спутникам и ему дали бобы. Говорится, что дети Израиля в пустыни пожелали «есть мясо», и, как следствие, их Бог рассердился на них.

Существует эзотерическое значение того факта, что толпу накормили рыбой, но, обращаясь исключительно к материальному аспекту, можно резюмировать основные положения, затронутые в нашем ответе, повторив, что когда-нибудь мы избавимся от потребности в мясе и рыбе как пищи подобно тому, как мы поднялись над каннибализмом. Что бы ни было дозволено в варварском прошлом, оно исчезнет в альтруистическом будущем, когда усовершенствованная способность сопереживать пробудит нас к более полному осознанию всего ужаса, производимого наслаждением от поедания плоти.

Для более полного представления о том, «оправдывает ли Библия употребление мяса», мы отошлем задающего вопрос к небольшой брошюре с тем же названием, изданной обществом «Единство» в Канзас Сити, Миссури.

Брошюра представляет все «за и против» с полным беспристрастием и показывает, что лишь уступка упомянутой ранее жажде мяса допустила подобную практику.

### <h3 id="question-108">Вопрос 108</h3>

Объясните, пожалуйста, почему откормленный теленок был заколот не для праведного сына, а для расточительного. Не было ли это наградой за неправильное поведение?

Ответ: Сюжет о расточительном сыне был не реальным событием, а притчей, с помощью которой Христос хотел преподнести урок. Этот рассказ повествует о странствии духа через материю. Существуют разные классы духов. Некоторые, но не все пошли в школу жизни, в мир. Они постепенно спускались из своего высокого состояния в Мире Бога глубже и глубже в море материи, ослепившее их. В конце концов они запутались в плотной материи Физического мира. Вот та поворотная точка, в которой они пробудились; здесь кончается бессознательная тропа инволюции; здесь достигается самосознание и осознание внешнего мира. Но дух внутри не довольствуется тем, чтобы оставаться в этом мире. Заново пробужденный к ощущению своей неотъемлемой божественности, он чувствует, что его вновь притягивают высшие сферы, и говорит: «Встану, пойду к Отцу моему».

Затем приходит время тяжкого труда по отделению различных проводников, в которых он оказался запутанным, и по собственному подъему к сознательному единству с Богом. Пока он занимался этой тяжелой задачей и «был еще далеко, увидел его отец его и сжалился; и, побежав, пал ему на шею»; тихий слабый голос изнутри начинает говорить и рассказывает о небесной славе. И наконец, когда эволюция человечества завершится или отдельный дух выберет кратчайший путь Посвящения, произойдет воссоединение с Богом и другими братьями, которые еще не пошли в школу опыта. Естественно, больше радуются возвращению того, кто доблестно сражался и вернулся в свой небесный дом, чем тому, кто еще не пытался воспользоваться подобной возможностью.

### <h3 id="question-109">Вопрос 109</h3>

Почему Господь похвалил управителя неверного, как говорится в шестнадцатой главе Евангелия от Луки?

Ответ: Спрашивающему следует тщательно перечитать главу. Там рассказано о нечестном управляющем, который предстал перед своим господином, подозревавшим, что что-то неладное происходит с его счетами. Этот нечестный управляющий сторговался с должниками своего хозяина, чтобы обезопасить себя на случай отставки со своей должности. В стихе 8 говорится, что «похвалил господин управителя неверного», господин, а не Господь. Когда управитель оплачивал свои счета, он должен был так искусно их оформить, чтобы обмануть своего хозяина, и господин этого человека, его хозяин, а не Господь, то есть Христос, был тем, кто похвалил его.

### <h3 id="question-110">Вопрос 110</h3>

Пожалуйста, объясните, что значит грешить против Духа Святого?
Ответ: Вообще говоря, Святой Дух — это созидательная сила Бога. Для подтверждения вспомните отрывок из символа веры: «Воплотившегося от Духа Святого», который, как сказал Марии Гавриил, должен сойти на нее. Так все, что существует, начало быть; и именно этот отблеск атрибута Бога используется человеком для сохранения расы. Когда им злоупотребляют, то есть когда его используют для услаждения чувств, в одиночку или с проституткой, в законном браке или вне брака, это грех против Духа Святого. Сейчас от этого греха страдает человечество в целом. Ослабление тела и окружающие нас болезни вызваны веками злоупотреблений, и, пока мы не научимся подчинять наши страсти, в человеческой расе не будет истинного здоровья. Мы родились от родителей, которых учили, что надо удовлетворять свои страсти в любое и всякое время. Как следствие, сейчас мы страдаем, и из-за нашего отношения к вопросам секса большинство из нас в настоящее время награждает своих детей болезнями. Таким образом, дети будут наказываться за вину отцов от поколения к поколению, и вина отцов будет продолжать приносить горе и страдание, пока мы не поймем, что у каждого ребенка есть право получить достойное рождение и должные физические условия в период предродовой жизни.

### <h3 id="question-111">Вопрос 111</h3>

Основан ли символ христианской веры на божественном источнике?

Ответ: Существует три варианта христианского символа веры. Одно из них известно как Апостольский символ веры, и хотя он не был составлен апостолами, предполагается, что он воплощает их убеждения. Другой символ веры был сформулирован и одобрен на Никейском Соборе и называется Никейским символом веры. Символ веры Афанасия был еще более поздним. Их источник не более божественен, чем источник любого спора человека относительно Библии.

Однако Библия сама дает символ веры в отрывке, где утверждается, что нет другого имени кроме имени Иисуса Христа под небом, данного человекам, которым надлежало бы нам спастись. Это утверждение полностью соответствует эзотерическому учению, так как Иегова был создателем всех расовых религий, где страх Бога противопоставлялся страстям плоти, а закон был наложен на человека, чтобы обуздывать желания. Расовые религии воспитывают природу желания установленными мерами, но со временем будут заменены религией Христа. Религия братства и любви изгонит страх, порожденный Иеговой. Она постарается покончить с нациями, с их законами, с борьбой и соперничеством, воздействуя на жизненное тело так, что человечество будет побуждаемо к действию всецело любовью, а не законом. Тем не менее, этот этап не является завершающим. Когда царство Христа будет полностью установлено, Он посвятит его Отцу. Религия Отца будет еще выше, чем религия Сына.

### <h3 id="question-112">Вопрос 112</h3>

Как вы согласовываете закон Причины и Следствий с вероучением о прощении грехов?

Ответ: Неспособность верить в прощение грехов привела к тому, что многие верят исключительно в закон Причины и Следствий, которому обучают в восточных странах под названием Карма. Есть много людей, которые думают, что, поскольку восточные религии обучают этому закону и закону Возрождения более четко, чем западная религия, то есть христианство, эти восточные религии лучше, они более научные, чем западная религия, которая учит, согласно популярному толкованию, что Христос умер за наши грехи и, следовательно, вера в Него принесет нам спасение.

Однако на самом деле христианское учение отчетливо излагает доктрину «Что посеет человек, то и пожнет» и таким образом обучает как закону Причины и Следствий, так и прощению грехов. Оба эти закона являются жизненно важными для развития человечества, и именно поэтому ранние восточные религии обладают только частью полного учения, которое можно обнаружить в христианской религии.

В ранний период, когда религии Востока были даны людям, последние были более духовными, чем приземленные существа сегодняшнего западного мира. Люди того времени знали, что мы проживаем много жизней в различных формах и образах здесь, на Земле. Сейчас на Востоке они буквально пропитаны этой идеей и, как следствие, чрезвычайно ленивы. Они больше озабочены мыслями о нирване, невидимом мире, где они могут покоиться в мире и радости, чем использованием своих сегодняшних материальных возможностей для продвижения. Как следствие, их страны засушливы и пустынны, их урожаи невелики и часто уничтожаются палящим солнцем и опустошающими наводнениями. Они страдают от голода и умирают миллионами, и, хотя они изучают закон Причины и Следствий, кажется, что они не подозревают, что их жалкое существование обусловлено их ленью и безразличием к материальным вещам. Естественно, поскольку они не работали здесь, им нечего усваивать в небесной жизни между смертью и новым рождением, и подобно тому, как атрофируются неиспользуемые органы или конечности, так же и страна, которую не развивают воплощающиеся там духи, постепенно деградирует и становится бесполезной для проживания человечества. Для эволюции человечества было необходимо вступить в этот материальный мир и развить все его возможности.

Поэтому Великие Лидеры использовали различные способы, чтобы вынудить нас постепенно забыть духовную сторону нашей природы. На Западе, где оказались пионеры человеческой расы, они потребовали, чтобы браки осуществлялись вне семьи. Они дали Западу религию, которая неявным образом преподносила доктрину Возрождения и закон Причины и Следствий как способ продвижения. Они также инициировали использование алкоголя с его парализующим действием на духовую восприимчивость человека. В результате этих мер мы на Западе постепенно забыли, что существует нечто большее, чем одна эта жизнь на Земле, и, как следствие, с величайшим старанием мы стали извлекать наибольшую пользу из того, что, как мы верим, является здесь нашей единственной возможностью. Поэтому мы превращаем Запад в настоящий сад; мы создаем для себя между воплощениями землю, чрезвычайно плодородную и богатую полезными ископаемыми, необходимыми для различных отраслей промышленности, и таким образом мы покоряем видимый материальный мир.

Однако очевидно, что нельзя полностью пренебрегать религиозной стороной человеческой природы, и, так как Христос, великий идеал христианской религии, был дан нам как образец для подражания, мы не могли бы надеяться стать подобными Христу в течение одной жизни, единственной, о которой мы сейчас знаем. Нам должны были бы дать уравновешивающее учение, или мы прекратили бы бороться в отчаянии, зная, что это бесполезно. Поэтому западному миру было дано вероучение о прощении грехов через праведность Иисуса Христа.

Но верно и то, что учение, которое не является истинным по своей природе, не может обладать силой духовного подъема. Поэтому учение о прощении грехов, которое, как кажется, искажает закон причинности, должно обладать веским основанием. Вот оно.

Оглядываясь вокруг себя в материальном мире, мы наблюдаем различные проявления природы, встречаемся с разными людьми и по-разному с ними взаимодействуем. И все эти пейзажи, звуки и сцены воспринимаются посредством органов чувств. Но не все их мы осознаем, так как обычно мы не наблюдательны по отношению к деталям. Печальная правда состоит в том, что у нас «глаза, которыми не видят, и уши, которыми не слышат». Из-за этого мы теряем огромный объем опыта. Сверх того, наша память никуда не годится, несмотря на то что мы можем кое-что припомнить, основная часть нашего опыта потеряна для нас, потому что мы ее забываем. Наша сознательная память слаба. Но тем не менее существует другая память. Подобно тому, как эфир и воздух доставляют в фотоаппарат на фотографическую пластину изображение внешнего пейзажа, не упуская ни малейших деталей, так же эфир и воздух, доставляющие впечатления из окружающего мира в наши органы чувств, приносят в наши легкие и оттуда в кровь картины происходящего и запись всего того, с чем мы приходим в соприкосновение. Эти картины хранятся в маленьком атоме-семени, располагающемся в левом желудочке сердца, и этот маленький атом можно считать книгой Ангелов-регистраторов, где запечатлеваются все наши поступки. Оттуда они воспроизводятся отражающим эфиром нашего жизненного тела.

При обычном течении жизни человек попадает после смерти в чистилище и искупает грехи, запечатленные на этом атоме. Позже он усваивает на Первом небе все то добродетельное, что было накоплено им, а на Втором небе работает над своим будущим окружением. Но благочестивый человек каждый день осознает свои недостатки и неудачи. Он ежедневно изучает события своей жизни и молится из глубины своего праведного сердца о прощении за совершенные грехи. Тогда картины с записью ошибок и нарушений закона постепенно исчезают и уничтожаются из записей его жизни день ото дня, так как задачей Бога или природы не является сведение счетов, как может показаться, если учитывать закон Причинности, который предписывает точное воздаяние за каждое нарушение, как и награду или компенсацию за каждое доброе дело. Цель Бога заключается в том, чтобы мы при помощи опыта научились здесь поступать законно и достойно. Когда мы понимаем, что поступили дурно, и решаем поступать лучше, мы усваиваем урок, и уже нет необходимости нас наказывать.

Итак, доктрина прощения грехов является реальностью в природе. Если мы раскаиваемся, молимся и изменяемся, грехи, в которых мы раскаиваемся, о которых молимся и которые исправляем, прощаются нам и искореняются из записей нашей жизни. В противном случае они искореняются соответствующими страданиями в чистилище после смерти. Таким образом, учение Кармы, или закон Причины и Следствий, которому обучают на Востоке, не в полной мере отвечает потребности человечества, а христианское учение, воплощающее как закон Причины и Следствий, так и доктрину прощения грехов, предоставляет более законченное учение о методе, который Великие Лидеры используют для того, чтобы нас направлять.

### <h3 id="question-113">Вопрос 113</h3>

При помощи какой силы Петр воскресил Серну из мертвых?

Ответ: Петр не воскрешал Серну из мертвых, как Христос не воскрешал из мертвых Лазаря или кого-либо другого, и не утверждал подобного. Он сказал: «Лазарь, друг наш, уснул; но Я иду разбудить его».

Для того чтобы этот вопрос можно было понять, мы объясним, что происходит при смерти и чем смерть отличается от транса, так как упомянутые выше люди были в состоянии транса в то время, когда происходили воображаемые чудеса.

В состоянии бодрствования, когда Эго сознательно функционирует в Физическом мире, его различные тела расположены концентрически, занимая одно и то же место, но ночью, когда тело засыпает, происходит разъединение. Эго, облаченное в тело ума и тело желаний, освобождается от плотного тела и жизненного тела, которые остаются на кровати. Высшие тела нависают сверху тела или около него. Они соединены с более плотными телами Серебряной Цепочкой, тонкой сверкающей нитью, принимающей форму двух шестерок, один конец которой присоединен к атому-семени в сердце, а другой — к центру вихря тела желаний.

В момент смерти эта нить обрывается у атома-семени в сердце, и силы этого атома исходят по желудочно-легочному нерву, через третий желудочек мозга и оттуда наружу через шов между затылочными и теменными костями черепа, по Серебряной Цепочке и в высшие проводники. Одновременно с разрывом нити жизненное тело также отделяется и присоединяется к высшим проводникам, нависающим над мертвым телом. Так оно остается примерно три с половиной дня. Затем высшие проводники сами отделяются от жизненного тела, которое обычно разлагается одновременно с плотным телом.

Во время последнего отделения Серебряная Цепочка также разрывается посередине и Эго освобождается от взаимодействия с материальным миром.

Во время сна Эго также выводится из плотного тела, но жизненное тело остается с плотным телом, и Серебряная Цепочка остается невредимой.

Иногда случается, что Эго не возвращается в тело утром, чтобы пробудить его как обычно, а остается снаружи на время от одного дня до неопределенного количества дней. Тогда говорят, что тело находится в естественном трансе. Но Серебряная Цепочка везде остается в целости. После же того как произошли разрывы, никакое восстановление невозможно. Христос и апостол были ясновидящими; они видели, что не произошло никаких разрывов в упомянутых случаях, поэтому было сказано: «Лазарь, друг наш, уснул; но Я иду разбудить его». Они также обладали силой заставить Эго вернуться в тело и воссоздать нормальное состояние. Таким образом осуществлялись ими так называемые чудеса.

### <h3 id="question-114">Вопрос 114</h3>

Верите ли вы в обращение?

Ответ: Конечно, но есть разные обращения. Есть обращения, которые происходят на собраниях секты «возрождения» под барабанную дробь, хлопанье в ладоши, пение евангельских гимнов и настойчивые призывы сторонников движения «возрожденцев» «осуществить обращение, пока еще не поздно». Вся подобная помощь при обращении создает сильное гипнотическое влияние, воздействующее на эмоциональную природу многих людей таким образом, что эти так называемые «грешники» не могут больше оставаться на своих местах, а вынуждаемы в прямом смысле этого слова подчиняться приказу и выйти на «скамью плакальщиков». Такой способ обращения обычно имеет очень мало смысла. «Возрожденцы» находят, что обращать людей подобным образом чрезвычайно просто. Неразрешимая проблема заключается в том, чтобы, как кто-то сказал, «заставить их придерживаться», так как когда жертва гипноза «возрожденцев» покидает собрание, влияние постепенно ослабевает и рано или поздно она впадает в первоначальное состояние. И хотя эти «вероотступники» могут не ощущать никаких мук при отступничестве, следующее собрание возрождения опять затащит их на скамью плакальщиков с той же вероятностью, как магнит притягивает иглу. Их повторно обращают, и они регулярно отступают каждый раз после собрания возрождения, к великому отвращению «возрожденцев» и изумлению прихожан, которые не подозревают, что это простой случай легкого гипноза.

Тем не менее существует другое обращение, всегда сопровождающееся планетарными влияниями, и в соответствии с силой этих влияний обращение, или изменение в жизни, будет более или менее принципиальным. Тогда оно показывает, что душа достигла определенной точки в своем странствии, где она почувствовала притяжение высшей жизни. Непосредственной причиной обращения может быть проповедь, лекция либо книга, или строка из Библии, или что-то в природе, но это лишь физическая причина чего-то, что уже осуществилось духовно. С этого момента мужчина или женщина начнет смотреть на жизнь с новой точки зрения, избавится от прежних дурных наклонностей, будет следовать новым направлениям мысли и устремлений. Этот момент может изменить всю жизнь и все окружение человека. Очень часто путешествие отрывает его от привычного окружения на некоторое время, чтобы предоставить ему подходящие условия для посева нового семени.

### <h3 id="question-115">Вопрос 115</h3>

Имеют ли исповедь и отпущение грехов какую-нибудь ценность?

Ответ: Если спрашивающий подразумевает исповедь и отпущение грехов в том смысле, в котором они практикуются католической церковью, можно утверждать, что священник не обладает властью прощать кающегося, и практика исповеди духовными чинами церкви в лучшем случае обычно является не чем иным, как внешней демонстрацией раскаяния, напоминая молитву фарисея, который шел в храм, чтобы его могли видеть люди.

Если, с другой стороны, исповедь сделана в духе книжника, то есть в духе искреннего покаяния, тогда она имеет ценность. Как маленький ребенок, совершивший проступок, чувствует угрызения совести и сожаление, так и нам следует чувствовать сильное раскаяние за свои грехи совершенных ошибок и нарушений.

Внимательные родители часто замечают, что покаяние в тишине недостаточно для их ребенка, которому нужно пойти к родителю и покаяться в своем грехе. Когда прощение родителя достигнуто, совесть успокаивается. Так же и с чадом Божиим. Мы грешим и сожалеем о наших грехах; мы решаем не совершать то или иное зло снова; но, если мы можем исповедоваться тому, кому мы верим, и получить его сочувствие и заверение, что это зло не обратится против нас, нашей совести станет легче. Вот принцип, лежащий в основе требования Библии: «Признавайтесь друг пред другом в проступках». Тот, кому мы признаемся, конечно, будет человеком, к которому мы испытываем глубокое уважение и любовь, и он или она предстают перед нами в этот момент как представители Бога или как наша высшая природа, и мы, таким образом, чувствуем большое облегчение, получив его сочувствие. Но мы также чувствуем, что договор, который мы заключили сами с собой, не совершать повторно возможного греха, был усилен его присутствием. Если исповедь осуществляется подобным образом и достигается прощение, тогда без сомнения она имеет очень благотворное воздействие.

### <h3 id="question-116">Вопрос 116</h3>

Имеет ли какое-нибудь значение проведение обрядов на латыни, используемое католической церковью? Не лучше ли было бы перевести их, так чтобы все могли понимать? И не следует ли отдать предпочтение импровизированным проповедям и молитвам, используемым протестантскими церквями перед обрядами и шаблонными мессами католиков?

Ответ: В настоящее время человечество развилось так сильно, что в некоторых отношениях оно поднялось над законом. Например, многие подчиняются закону «не укради».

Закон — это узда для природы желаний, но там, где предполагается эзотерическое или, скорее, духовное продвижение, должно быть достигнуто одухотворение жизненного тела.

Это достигается посредством искусства и религии, при часто повторяющихся воздействиях, так как основой жизненного тела является повторение, как мы можем заметить, обратившись к растениям, у которых есть только плотное тело и жизненное тело. Их стебель и лист следуют друг за другом в восходящей последовательности; растение поддерживает их поочередный рост. Именно жизненное тело строит позвонки позвоночника человека один за другим с постоянным повторением. А память, например, являющаяся одной из способностей жизненного тела, укрепляется и развивается при постоянном повторении.

Когда протестанты покинули католическую церковь, они действительно избежали многих злоупотреблений, но также и потеряли почти все ценное. Они отказались от обрядов, которые каждому следует знать и понимать, несмотря на плохую дикцию проповедника. Зная обряд, миряне могут посылать свои мысли в одном направлении с мыслями священника, который читает мессу. И таким образом огромный объем одинаковых духовных мыслей собирается вместе и проецируется на прихожан во благо или во вред. В наше время прихожане протестантской церкви слушают импровизированную молитву или проповедь священника, который обычно особенно не думает о стоящей перед ним духовной работе, так как больше озабочен тем, чтобы украсить свою речь благозвучными фразами для услаждения слуха прихожан. Они забывают о том, что он говорил, прежде, чем покинут церковь. Те, кто ходит в католическую церковь, понимая обряды, даже в наши дни способны объединить свои мысли в духовный конклав и сохранить в памяти происходившее. Так они каждый раз понемногу добавляют к одухотворению своего жизненного тела, в то время как у членов протестантской церкви подвергается воздействию лишь эмоциональная природа, и такое воздействие быстро вытесняется. Библия учит нас молиться не прекращая, и многие насмехаясь говорили, что, если Бог всеведущ, Он знает, что нам нужно и без наших молитв, а если Он не всеведущ, то скорее всего он и не всемогущ, а поэтому наши молитвы не удовлетворяются, поэтому молиться бесполезно. Но данное требование исходило из знания природы жизненного тела, которому необходимо подобное повторение для того, чтобы оно могло одухотвориться.

То же самое и в отношении обрядов. Что касается латыни, то в первой главе Евангелия от Иоанна утверждается, что в начале было Слово... «все чрез Него начало быть, и без Него ничто не начало быть, что начало быть». Слово — это звук. Если мы возьмем песок или семена растений и поместим их на металлическую пластину или на стеклянную тарелку, а затем возьмем смычок скрипки и проведем им по краю, мы произведем звук, и этот звук вынудит семена или песок образовать геометрические фигуры, похожие на кристаллы, из которых образованы все предметы. Каждый звук образует различные структуры. Итак, если определенный звук производит определенный эффект, которого мы хотим достичь, мы не сможем изменить звук, не изменив его действия. Если мы производим определенный звук, говоря «Deum», а затем переводим Deum, говоря «Бог», то звук получается совершенно иным. Поскольку звук производит определенные воздействия на наши невидимые тела, то те воздействия, которые достигались изначальными обрядами на латыни, оказались утерянными для протестантской церкви, изменившей язык обрядов на английский или вообще отменив их.

Люди часто удивляются, что католическая церковь сохраняет власть над своими прихожанами, но можно сказать, что, если бы в ней отменили обряды на латыни, у нее бы не осталось последователей через десять лет. Более того, ее действительно эзотерические ритуалы не были перенесены на английский язык, и даже среди розенкрейцеров пользуются популярностью обряды на латыни во время службы, хотя и не такие, как в католической церкви.

### <h3 id="question-117">Вопрос 117</h3>

В чем истинный смысл мученичества? Действительно ли мученики становятся святыми?

Ответ: Человек поднимается к союзу с Богом по четырем великим ступеням, или этапам. Сначала он молится или приносит жертвы Богу, которого боится и потому стремится умилостивить, чтобы Он не причинил ему вреда. Затем он учится воспринимать Бога как могущественного союзника против своих врагов и подателя всего доброго, то есть, получая необходимое, он подчиняется Богу и жертвует ему материальные вещи, которыми обладает. На третьем этапе он учится жертвовать собой, ведя праведную жизнь и ожидая награды в будущем состоянии, называемом небом, где ожидается, что он будет жить в состоянии нескончаемого счастья, компенсирующего все, что он вытерпел в течение своей земной жизни. Мученики находились на этапе, когда они придерживались подобных верований и полностью вдохновлялись истиной и славой неба. Поэтому им казалось нетрудным пожертвовать своей жизнью, чтобы потом сразу достичь будущей славы.

В действительности, если бы мученичество могло отпереть небеса с вечным блаженством, это было бы самым легким способом получить награду. Можно не бояться умереть, но как-никак требуется гораздо больше смелости, чтобы жить. Мы очень склонны думать, что, если человек отдал свою жизнь, он сделал самое большее, на что был способен. Мы часто слышим, как говорят о совершившем самоубийство, что «он за все расплатился». На самом деле самоубийство — это обычно проявление наибольшей трусости, так что гораздо меньше следует восхищаться мученичеством, чем жизнью людей, которые день за днем стремятся следовать духовным учениям Библии и вести благородную жизнь. Конечно, легко признать, что мученики достойны восхищения за свою преданность вере перед лицом смерти и под пыткой. Без сомнения, у них будет больше возможностей для духовного роста в последующих жизнях по сравнению с тем, чего они лишились, будучи сожжены на костре или уничтожены другим способом. И мы можем также с уверенностью сказать, что они были праведниками и святыми людьми в том смысле, что их вера значила для них больше, чем жизнь. Но мы настаиваем, что церковный указ не способен превратить грешника в праведника.

### <h3 id="question-118">Вопрос 118</h3>

На одной из ваших лекций вы сказали, что на самом деле было ошибкой посылать миссионеров в другие страны; что религии, практикуемые так называемыми язычниками, правильны для них в настоящее время и что миссионеры на настоящий момент не принесли им большого вреда. Как тогда Вы объясните приказ Христа своим апостолам: «Идите по всему миру и проповедуйте Евангелие всей твари»?

Ответ: Значение слов Христа очевидно основано на интерпретации слова «мир». Если под этим словом мы понимаем весь мир, то было бы правильно посылать миссионеров в чужие страны. Но в Библии сказано, что ученики, которым был дан этот приказ, вернулись, завершив свою миссию, что означает, что слова приказа не могли подразумевать включение целого мира. В связи с этим слову «мир» лучше было бы придать значение «государства», которое также можно найти в некоторых наших словарях в качестве другого значения этого слова. Во времена Христа люди не знали всего мира. Даже в наши дни оказывается, что самый западный мыс Испании называется мысом Финистерре — концом Земли. Поэтому этот термин во времена, когда Христос отдавал свой приказ, не мог включать всю Землю, какой мы знаем ее сегодня.

Наше утверждение не противоречит учению Библии и по другой причине. Неверно посылать миссионеров к людям, которых мы называем «язычниками», так как их развитие пока таково, что они не могут воспринять религию, проповедующую любовь к своему ближнему, религию, которую даже мы еще не научились вводить в практику. Кроме того, если великие Ангелы-регистраторы, ответственные за человеческую эволюцию, могут судить о наших потребностях и помещать каждого в такое окружение, где он сможет получить необходимое влияние, наиболее способствующее его прогрессу, мы должны также верить, что они дали каждой нации наиболее благотворную для ее развития религию. Поэтому, когда человек помещается в страну, где обучают христианской религии, эта религия содержит идеалы, к которым ему следует стремиться, но пытаться заставить следовать им других людей, которые были помещены в другие условия, означает возносить свои собственные суждения на уровень решений Бога и Его посланников, Ангелов-регистраторов. Но, как уже сказано, христианские миссионеры не причинили большого вреда народам, которые они посещали, но они могли бы принести больше пользы дома. Нам не нужно удаляться далеко от дома, чтобы найти язычников, которых необходимо наставлять в Библии. Профессор Вилвур Л. Кросс из Йеля замечает, например, что в классе, состоящем из сорока учеников, ни один не смог ничего сказать об Иуде Искариоте. У него был еврейский ученик, который ничего не слыхал о Моисее, а на вопрос о причинах Исхода наилучшим был ответ, что это так была основана Новая Англия. Если бы миссионеры взаимодействовали с подобными язычниками, они бы, вероятно, совершили благое дело.

Больший вред тем не менее наносится, когда Восток присылает своих миссионеров сюда для обращения нас в индуизм и родственные религии, так как очень часто такие индуисты обучают дыхательным упражнениям, вызывающим безумие или истощение организма, потому что наши западные тела совсем не приспособлены к подобным практикам. Гораздо более безопасно остановиться на религии своей страны, изучать ее и применять на практике, оставив другим нациям право делать то же самое в отношении их собственных религий.

### <h3 id="question-119">Вопрос 119</h3>

Вреден ли медиумизм для здоровья?

Ответ: Это зависит от следующих факторов: если человек становится медиумом для развоплощенного духа, который входит в его тело, как в случае с трансовыми медиумами, когда развоплощенный дух завладевает телом и использует его так, как мог бы использовать владелец, то вред небольшой, если он вообще есть, при условии, что руководство духа не нарушает прав хозяина тела. На самом деле нередко руководство духа в большей степени отражает заботу о теле, а не о его хозяине и может иногда привести к улучшению здоровья. Но духи высокой этической природы обычно не управляют медиумом, скорее это делают именно привязанные к Земле более низкие духи, такие, как индейские и другие духи подобной природы, которые добиваются управления медиумами и, обладая телом, могут использовать его для удовлетворения своих низких страстей — выпивки и секса. Таким образом они нарушают работу системы и повреждают инструмент.

В случае материализующего медиума можно сказать, что это всегда вредное влияние. Материализующийся дух входит в жертву и затем вытягивает эфир через селезенку, так как различие между материализующим медиумом и обычным человеком заключается в том, что соединение между жизненным телом и плотным у такого медиума столь слабое, что можно извлечь из него жизненное тело в очень большой степени. Жизненное тело — это проводник, в котором сосредотачиваются дающие нам жизненную силу солнечные течения. Лишенное жизненной энергии тело медиума во время материализации иногда сокращается вполовину от обычного объема. Плоть становится слабой, и искра жизни еле теплится. Когда сеанс заканчивается и жизненное тело возвращается на место, медиум пробуждается и приходит в нормальное сознание. После этого он ощущает ужаснейшее изнеможение и иногда, к сожалению, прибегает к спиртному, чтобы восстановить жизненные силы. В этом случае, конечно, здоровье очень быстро разрушается и медиум станет совершенной развалиной. В любом случае медиумизма следует избегать, так как помимо этой опасности для инструмента существуют другие, гораздо более серьезные соображения, связанные с более тонкими телами и, в частности, с состоянием в посмертии.

### <h3 id="question-120">Вопрос 120</h3>

Где медиумы осуществляют так называемые путешествия души, что именно покидает физическое тело и может ли это нечто покидать тело в состоянии бодрствования, чтобы собрать данные?

Ответ: Медиум является негативным или ненамеренным ясновидящим и управляемым духом из мира Желаний. Он или она соответствует жертве гипнотизера в Физическом мире. В случае с гипнотизером жертва видит его в состоянии бодрствования, а медиум не видит духа, который гипнотизирует его, пока не вытеснит из тела. Тогда медиум оказывается одетым в свое тело желаний и поэтому обычно не может сохранить по возвращении память о своем опыте.

Медиум получает весь свой опыт, пока его тело находится в трансе. Именно Эго, облаченное в тело ума и тело желаний, покидает свое физическое тело. Подобное разделение происходит и при сне без сновидений, однако с той разницей, что тело на постели не остается бесхозным, а в случае медиума управляющий дух обычно входит в его физическое тело, овладевает им и использует его в свое удовольствие, часто нанося вред медиуму, поскольку, если этот управляющий дух был пьяницей или развратником во время земной жизни, он часто использует тело медиума, чтобы удовлетворить свое страстное желание выпить спиртного или удовлетворить свои основные чувственные инстинкты. Мы не можем очень глубоко запечатлеть в сознании людей, что физическое тело является нашим самым ценным инструментом и что очень плохо отдавать его на милость как гипнотизеру, так и управляющему духу. Для медиума опасность еще больше, так как иногда управляющей стороной может быть не обычное человеческое Эго, а элементал, не способный обычным образом функционировать в Физическом мире. Когда после смерти медиум попадает в мир Желаний, элементал обретает такую власть над телом желаний медиума, что может лишить владельца его проводника. Тело желаний — это тот проводник, откуда приходит мотив действия, и поэтому, если Эго лишено этого проводника, нет ничего, что бы привело его к перевоплощению. Элементал может удерживать тело даже миллионы лет, так что, пока остальное человечество движется вперед, несчастное Эго, лишенное своего тела желаний, остается бездеятельным и, возможно, сильно отстанет от своих собратьев прежде, чем оно освободится от бремени этого существа. Поэтому медиумизм — это после черной магии смертельнейшая из опасностей для души, о которых автор знает или которые может себе представить.

### <h3 id="question-121">Вопрос 121</h3>

У меня было много полетов души, и в одном из таких путешествий проводник провел меня через ворота в хрустальный город и дальше во дворец, полный неземных людей, со словами: «Это Святой Божий город». Не могли бы Вы мне объяснить, где все это находится, почему там есть ворота и стены вокруг города и почему все выглядело как будто хрустальным?

Ответ: Особенностью вещества желаний, которое является материей мира Желаний, является его чрезвычайная пластичность и легкость формирования мыслью. В мгновение ока оно принимает самые различные формы в соответствии с вдохновляющей его мыслью, и, если много людей на Земле думают в одном направлении, все их мысли собираются вместе и образуют одно большое целое.

Так в нижних областях мира Желаний мысли людей, верящих в огненный, подобный печи ад, создают из вещества желаний такое место пыток. Там можно видеть дьяволов с копытами, рогами и хвостами, прокалывающих несчастных грешников вилами. Очень часто, после того как люди с подобными верованиями проходят через смерть, они оказываются в плачевном состоянии, будучи в ужасе от созерцания этого места, которое они помогли создать. Так же и в высших областях мира Желаний есть город, такой же, как вы описали, с жемчужными воротами, стеклянным морем и великим белым престолом, на котором восседает мыслеформа Бога, созданная людьми и являющаяся в образе старца. Возможно, вы посетили это место, являющееся неотъемлемым атрибутом мира Желаний, и оно будет оставаться таким до тех пор, пока люди будут продолжать думать о Новом Иерусалиме подобным образом, так как у этих форм нет жизни без поддерживающих мыслей человечества. Когда со временем человечество перерастет эту веру, город, созданный их мыслями, перестанет существовать. Его кристаллообразный вид обязан собой чрезвычайному блеску вещества желаний, из которого он создан. По этой причине древние алхимики называли мир Желаний «астральным», «звездным».

### <h3 id="question-122">Вопрос 122</h3>

Правда ли, что тела желаний, оставленные продвигающимися Эго, используются элементалами для обмана друзей и родственников умерших людей? Как их можно обнаружить и распознать?

Ответ: Покинув тело во время смерти, и после пребывания в чистилище в течение большего или меньшего времени дух входит на Первое небо, все еще обладая телом желаний. Но когда он вступает на Второе небо, тело желаний остается позади подобно тому, как жизненное и плотное тела были оставлены во время смерти и немного спустя. Но тогда как плотное тело подвергается гниению и разлагается, становится неподвижным и бесполезным сразу, как только его покидает дух, с телом желаний все происходит совсем иначе. Материал, из которого создано это тело, гораздо в большей степени наделен жизнью Универсальным Духом, так что оно сохраняет способность перемещаться спустя долгое время после того, как его покидает дух. Под действием магнетического притяжения оболочка притягивается к тем, с кем дух был связан во время земной жизни, и память об этой прошлой жизни очень часто дает оболочке возможность успешно выдавать себя за умершего родственника. Это именно тот случай, когда оболочка используется элементальной сущностью.

Явлением этих пустых оболочек, одушевленных элементалами, удовлетворительно объясняются большинство явлений, происходящих на спиритических сеансах. Выходки элементалов, такие, как выливание воды на шеи сидящим, опрокидывание стульев, столов и тому подобное, являются образцами того, что могут сделать такие пустые оболочки, когда ими овладевают элементалы.

Относительно того, как мы можем их обнаружить или распознать: очевидно, что тогда как наши умершие друзья или родственники обладали здравым смыслом, ничего нельзя добиться от глупых и бессмысленных контактов с этими пустыми оболочками, так как дух, который на самом деле и был нашим другом, исчез, оставив дом пустым. Поэтому мы можем судить о них по их словам и поступкам, как мы судим здесь о людях.

### <h3 id="question-123">Вопрос 123</h3>

Могут ли элементалы принимать вид животных и рептилий, и что можно сделать, чтобы остановить их?

Ответ: В этом материальном мире все формы стабильны и не так легко меняются. В данном отношении мир Желаний совершенно другой. Волшебные сказки, такие, как превращение мышей в истории о Золушке и тому подобное, являются реальными фактами в мире Желаний, так как формы меняются по воле вдохновляющей их жизни с быстротой молнии, что приводит в замешательство новичка, который вступает в этот мир. Поэтому необходимо, чтобы ясновидящий был обучен, чтобы не поддаться очарованию формы, которая все время меняется и может принять любой вид в любой момент. Если мы можем видеть вдохновляющую жизнь, перестает иметь значение, какой вид она принимает в данную минуту, обмануть нас невозможно. Как все остальные в мире Желаний, элементалы обладают этой способностью менять свой вид, и именно поэтому необученные ясновидящие принимают за правду так много удивительных сказок и видений. Ничего нельзя поделать, чтобы не допустить изменений вида элементалами, но мы можем прогнать их прочь, как прогоняют орущего под окном спальни кота.

### <h3 id="question-124">Вопрос 124</h3>

Как можно избежать случаев одержимости?

Ответ: Одержимость — это состояние, при котором развоплощенный дух овладевает чьим-то телом на очень долгое время после того, как выселил владельца. Но иногда люди, привыкшие к выпивке или другому пороку, пытаются найти себе оправдание, заявляя, что они одержимы. Если человек делает подобные заявления о себе, то можно всегда быть почти уверенным, что это не что иное, как оправдание, так как вор, укравший что-то здесь, в материальном мире, не будет ходить и рассказывать людям, что он украл. Так же и при одержимости сущностью, она не ходит, рассказывая о случившемся. Почти наверняка подобная сущность не заботится о том, что думают о человеке, тело которого она украла, поэтому ей нет никакой причины заявлять о себе и рисковать подвергнуться обряду изгнания.

Существует безошибочный способ узнать, действительно ли человек одержим, а именно по диагнозу глаз. «Глаза — зеркало души», и только настоящий хозяин может сокращать или расширять радужную оболочку или зрачок глаза. Итак, если мы приведем человека, утверждающего, что он одержим, или того, кого мы считаем одержимым, в затемненную комнату, мы обнаружим, что его зрачок не будет расширяться, если он одержим. Также его зрачок не будет сужаться, если мы выведем человека на яркий свет или попросим его прочитать мелкий шрифт, и расширяться, если мы попросим его посмотреть на отдаленный предмет. Вкратце, зрачок глаза не будет реагировать как на свет, так и на расстояние, если человек одержим, но следует учесть, что существует также болезнь, двигательная атаксия, когда зрачок не реагирует на расстояние, но реагирует на свет.

Тот, кто поддерживает положительный настрой ума, никогда не подвергнется одержимости, так как, пока мы отстаиваем свою индивидуальность, она достаточна сильна, чтобы держать на расстоянии любого чужака. Но на спиритических сеансах, где все присутствующие обладают негативным характером, всегда присутствует угроза. Самым лучшим способом избежать одержимости является поддержание положительного умонастроения. И всякий, кто предрасположен к негативному умонастроению, должен избегать спиритических сеансов, разглядывания кристалла и других методов вызывания духов. В любом случае эта практика порочна, так как те, кто перешел грань, должны работать там и не следует привлекать их сюда.

### <h3 id="question-125">Вопрос 125</h3>

Что такое психометрия?

Ответ: Согласно научным данным, каждая частица вещества в Физическом мире пронизана эфиром, так что химические атомы любого вещества, неважно какой плотности, не соприкасаются друг с другом, но каждый маленький атом вибрирует в поле этого всепроникающего эфира. Вибрации эфира, испускаемые каждым объектом, приносят нашим глазам изображение окружающих нас предметов. Это изображение сохраняется. Изображения всех предметов, которые мы сознательно наблюдали, все еще существуют в эфире нашего жизненного тела, и все зависит от нашей способности вызывать их, независимо от того, помним мы о них или нет.

Также в пронизывающем каждый объект эфире существует изображение всего того, что окружало этот объект. На стенах нашей комнаты начертаны все сцены, каждый эпизод, когда-нибудь имевший место в этой комнате, и, даже если мы попытаемся содрать их вместе с рейками и штукатуркой, будет невозможно избавиться от всех начертанных там изображений. Если мы возьмем кусок штукатурки из такой комнаты и принесем его человеку, который развил эфирное зрение, этот человек сможет увидеть эфир этого куска штукатурки и рассказать о событиях, происходивших там, откуда пришла эта штукатурка. Если мы покажем ему камень от египетской пирамиды, он увидит эти пирамиды так же хорошо, как если бы мы принесли ему фотографию, поскольку именно эфир такого объекта, как пирамида, производит воздействие на фотографическую пластину фотографа. Единственное отличие такого воздействия от воздействия, которое мы получаем через глаза, заключается в том, что мы способны зафиксировать его на фотографической пластине и можем посмотреть на изображение в любое время, тогда как мы не можем четко воспроизвести зрительно события нашего прошлого при обычных обстоятельствах. Но психометрист, который может считывать с эфира, имеет в своем распоряжении великолепную картинную галерею.

### <h3 id="question-126">Вопрос 126</h3>

Правда ли, что на спиритических сеансах людей иногда переносят телесно из одного места в другое невидимыми руками; что цветы появляются в комнате при закрытых окнах и дверях, и если это так, как возможно делать подобное?

Ответ: Да, совершенно верно, явления, о которых вы упомянули, иногда происходят при условиях, когда невозможно никакое мошенничество. Относительно передвижения предметов можно сказать, что подобное могут осуществить духи, ответственные за сеанс, различными путями. Руки могут быть материализованы, как видимые, так и невидимые, и они могут поднимать предметы или людей с одного места на другое, или эти предметы могут быть подняты временной остановкой действия закона тяготения по отношению к данному объекту. Относительно цветов, которые проносят сквозь стену, закрытое окно или другие материальные объекты, мы должны помнить, что эти объекты не такие твердые, как мы обычно думаем. Наука признает тот факт, что любые два атома в любом веществе не соприкасаются, но все атомы колеблются и вибрируют с различными скоростями в море эфира, который пронизывает вещество. Хорошо известно также, что все вещества могут быть превращены в газ. Железо, камень, воду, любое другое названное вещество можно превратить в газ. Понимание этого — первый шаг вперед в осознании того, что, подобно тому, как эти вещества переводятся в газообразное состояние и с легкостью возвращаются в исходное состояние, и цветок мог быть переведен в эфир, пропущен между атомами стены и затем возвращен обратно в состояние цветка. Вот что происходит на самом деле.

Но спрашивающий может сказать: «Да, но если вы возьмете серебряный доллар, расплавите его в тигле или реторте и превратите его в газ, он не примет форму доллара, когда вернется обратно в металлическое состояние, а останется просто комком металла». Это справедливо, когда процесс производит обычный человек, который не может отделять плотный материал от его эфирной составляющей во время процесса плавления. Но духовные сущности, производящие описанные выше явления, могут отделять эфирную часть цветка от плотного материала. И именно эфирная часть сохраняет его форму и образует матрицу, или трафарет, придающий форму материалу цветка, когда он освобождается в комнате после прохождения сквозь стену.

### <h3 id="question-127">Вопрос 127</h3>

Не могли бы вы объяснить использование планшетки? И точно определить, целесообразно ли пытаться произвести данное явление среди любителей?

Ответ: Планшетка — это маленькая дощечка, помещенная на колеса с приспособлением для поддерживания карандаша в вертикальном положении, так что, когда рука медиума помещается на доску и движется духами, карандаш записывает их послания на листке бумаги. Как все другие спиритические явления, планшетное письмо осуществляется развоплощенным духом через негативного медиума.

Когда существо покидает земную жизнь и вступает в невидимую, загробную жизнь, в чистилище и на различных небесах его ожидает эволюция, отличная от нашей. Попытка взаимодействовать с нами, находящимися здесь, при обычных обстоятельствах является регрессом. Поэтому все спиритические явления, которые приводят к взаимодействию развоплощенных духов с Физическим миром, должны быть резко осуждены, поскольку оказывают вредное воздействие на всех участвующих. Вступающие во взаимодействие существа также опасны для негативно настроенных людей, сидящих в кругу, которые до некоторой степени отказались от своей силы воли и своих тел.

Конечно, при использовании планшетки для записей все тело может не погружаться в транс, хотя иногда оно и погружается; но, по крайней мере, рука при этом отдается под контроль развоплощенного духа, которого сидящий не видит и который может быть, а может и не быть тем, кого он изображает. Если бы к нашей двери пришел бродяга и попытался бы убедить нас покинуть наш дом и разрешить ему стать его владельцем на некоторое время, мы с негодованием отказали бы ему. Но когда бродяга из мира Желаний просит нас разрешить ему стать владельцем самого драгоценного нашего дома, нашего тела, многие сразу же соглашаются, теша себя надеждой, что их посетил «дорогой Ангел». Но «дорогие Ангелы» и филантропы растут на каждом кусте в мире Желаний не более, чем здесь. Мы не устанем повторять, что у смерти нет преобразующей, трансформирующей силы и что невежественный индиец не станет вдруг самым мудрым только потому, что прошел опыт смерти. Так же как необходимо учиться, чтобы приобрести знания в этом мире, так и духи покойных должны прикладывать усилия, если хотят узнать что-нибудь об условиях того мира. И пока покойные не получат требуемый объем опыта, они не годятся на роль наших руководителей оттуда, пусть даже они были ими здесь. Самый безопасный путь заключается в том, чтобы отбросить все негативные явления, сконцентрировать всю нашу энергию на проживании своей жизни, делая упражнения, которые обучают нас тому, как попадать в тот мир по своей воле, или путешествовать в наших более тонких телах, или изучать его с помощью ясновидения, пока мы еще находимся в плотном теле. В этом заключается прогресс; если у нас есть эти способности, мы можем видеть развоплощенные существа лицом к лицу и сами судить, стоит ли прислушиваться к их совету или нет. Пока мы не освоим данные навыки, мы будем в проигрыше, и осторожность должна научить нас оставаться в безопасности.

### <h3 id="question-128">Вопрос 128</h3>

Вампир и оборотень — это одно и то же?

Ответ: Нет, вампир — это человек, который впитывает жизненную энергию другого, а тот, кого называли оборотнем в средневековые времена, имеет жизненное тело более низкого порядка — черного мага. Он может придавать ужасный вид своему жизненному телу и частично покрывать его плотным веществом, чтобы наносить вред другим людям. В старинных народных сказках говорится, что было бесполезно драться с этим существом, удары не наносили ему вреда. Но если нанести ему колотую рану ножом или другим острым инструментом, он начинал изрыгать кровь своей жертвы, визжа, убегал в свое логово, где можно было найти черного мага, страдающего от раны, нанесенной именно в том самом месте, в которое был ранен зверь. Это явление связано с любопытным феноменом, известным эзотерикам как отражение, которое можно наблюдать при материализации духов на сеансе. Эфир, в который эти духи материализуются, берется из тела медиума, и, если из одеяния этого духа вырезать кусок, этого куска будет недоставать в одежде медиума к концу сеанса. Данный факт использовали скептически настроенные исследователи, которым был неизвестен закон отражения, для того чтобы заклеймить медиумов как мошенников, тогда как на самом деле они были абсолютно честны, хотя и не могли объяснить факт, послуживший поводом для их осуждения.

### <h3 id="question-129">Вопрос 129</h3>

В чем разница между медиумом, входящим в транс, материализующим медиумом, обученным ясновидящим и обычным человеком?

Ответ: Грубо говоря, можно отметить, что сегодня человечество разделяется на два класса — на тех, у кого связь между жизненным телом и плотным телом очень сильна, и тех, у кого эта связь менее прочная. К первому классу относятся обычные люди, которые вовлечены в материальные сферы деятельности и совершенно не соприкасаются с Духовном миром. Ко второму классу относятся так называемые сверхчувствительные люди, которые также разделены на два класса. Один класс составляют те, кто побуждается своей волей из души, и они позитивны, или активны. К этому классу относятся обученные ясновидящие и невидимые помощники. Другой класс — негативный, пассивный, подчиняющийся воле других. Из этого класса пополняются ряды медиумов.

Когда связь между жизненным телом и плотным телом человека слаба, он будет чувствителен к духовным вибрациям, и если он позитивен, то сам, по собственной воле, будет развивать духовные способности, жить духовной жизнью и сможет своевременно получить учение, необходимое, чтобы стать обученным ясновидящим и знатоком своего дела, проявляя свои способности в любое время и, будучи свободным в выборе, используя их по своему усмотрению.

Если у человека слабая связь между жизненным и плотным телом и он обладает негативным умонастроением, он может стать добычей развоплощенных духов в качестве медиума.

Если связь жизненного тела и плотного тела очень слаба, так что его можно извлечь, а человек позитивен, он может стать невидимым помощником, способным забирать два высших эфира из своего плотного тела по своей воле и использовать их как проводник для чувственного восприятия и запоминания. Тогда он может сознательно действовать в Духовном мире и возвращаться, сохраняя полную память о том, что он там делал, так что, например, когда он ночью покидает свое тело, он участвует в жизни невидимого мира совершенно осознанно, как это происходит с нами здесь, когда мы просыпаемся утром после сна и выполняем свои различные обязанности в видимом мире.

Если у человека очень слабая связь между жизненным и плотным телом и негативный характер, то привязанные к Земле и стремящиеся проявиться здесь духи могут через селезенку вывести его жизненное тело и постепенно использовать эфир, из которого оно образовано, чтобы материализовать духовные формы, возвращая эфир медиуму после того, как заканчивается сеанс.

### <h3 id="question-130">Вопрос 130</h3>

Если медиумизм так опасен, то почему медиумы не перестанут позволять управлять собой?

Ответ: Во-первых, конечно, большинство медиумов не осознают, что находятся в большой опасности. В особенности они не сознают огромной опасности, которая угрожает им после смерти. Тело желаний тогда может быть подчинено управляющему духу. Попытавшись прекратить правление духа, пока они еще здесь в теле, они обнаружили бы, что эта сущность обладает над ними большой властью, узы которой очень тяжело разорвать. Они должны понять, что, когда смерть естественным образом приведет их в мир этих управляющих духов, опасность лишь возрастет.

Автору было известно несколько случаев, когда медиумы бунтовали и пытались избежать рабства управляющего духа, но так и не смогли разрушить прочную власть этой сущности. Они были беспомощны. Медиумы приходили к автору за помощью и рассказывали, что управляющий ими дух почти непреодолимо принуждал их совершить самоубийство или убийство. Они просили и умоляли управляющих духов оставить их, но безрезультатно. Известны случаи, когда управляющие духи безжалостно вытаскивали своих жертв среди ночи из постели против их воли и всячески донимали их. Очень редко можно услышать, чтобы они проявили милосердие, хотя автор знал медиумов, которые заболевали от подобных воздействий. Ему был известен один случай, когда управляющий дух вызвал у медиума недомогание, чтобы тот прислушался к его требованиям, и бросил его на несколько месяцев пока он выздоравливал.

Так можно видеть, что, занявшись медиумизмом, медиумы теряют право выбора; они утрачивают силу не впускать управляющих духов. Пока они выполняют приказания своего надсмотрщика и слушаются его, они не чувствуют узду, но стоит им заартачиться, тогда он или она быстро ощущают, что у управляющего духа есть и узда, и шпоры, и он безжалостен в их применении.

### <h3 id="question-131">Вопрос 131</h3>

В чем разница между ясновидящим, посвященным и адептом?

Ответ: То, что видит человек, зависит от чувствительности его глаз. Некоторые люди могут различать объекты на таких расстояниях, на которых они становятся невидимыми для других. Художники ощущают оттенки цветов, которые не могут различить обычные люди, а некоторые люди совсем слепы к цвету. Есть и такие, которые не могут видеть вообще — они абсолютно слепы.

Люди, которые могут видеть очень далеко, или те, кто различает тончайшие оттенки цвета в большей степени ясновидящие, или отчетливо видящие, чем остальные.

Большинство из нас способны видеть множество окружающих нас вещей, но мы узнаем очень мало о тех вещах, которые мы видим, только смотря на них. Нам надо стать посвященными в использовании телефона, велосипеда, автомобиля, пианино и так далее.

Но хотя мы будем знать, как использовать эти инструменты при обычных обстоятельствах, мы не столь глубоко знакомы с их устройством, чтобы суметь построить или починить их, когда они выходят из строя. Прежде чем мы достигнем высот в этой работе, нам придется пройти курс специального обучения, и, если мы отнесемся к этому добросовестно, мы сможем стать адептами, то есть мастерами в нашем направлении.

Если приложить данную иллюстрацию к обсуждаемой проблеме, мы сможем понять, что ясновидящий — это человек, чье чувство видения продвинулось так далеко, что он ощущает другой мир, невидимый для большинства из нас, и что он может видеть там все.

Но он не знает всего о том, что там видит посредством одного лишь восприятия, как и мы не знаем всего о том, что видим в мире. Он должен постараться приобрести это знание. Затем постепенно он станет посвященным, который понимает то, что видит, и сможет умело обращаться с этими знаниями при обычных условиях, как мы можем играть на пианино и ездить на велосипеде, когда освоим это искусство.

Чтобы посвященный мог стать властелином этих предметов и сил невидимого мира, то есть адептом, потребуется дальнейшее обучение.

Итак, ясновидящий — это тот, кто видит невидимый мир; посвященный — это тот, кто и видит невидимый мир, и понимает то, что видит; адепт же видит, знает и обладает властью над вещами и силами в этом мире.

### <h3 id="question-132">Вопрос 132</h3>

Почему обученные ясновидящие не соглашаются, чтобы ученые подвергли их простым, но убедительным проверкам, которые смогли бы убедить всех в реальности их способностей, превосходящих обычные чувства?

Ответ: Во-первых, обученные ясновидящие не преследуют корыстных целей; их даже в самой малой степени не интересует, верят им люди или нет, тогда как для самих людей было бы очень важно, если бы они верили; но для обученного ясновидящего в любом случае это не имеет никакого значения. Он никогда не добивается денег или других компенсаций, которые ему может предложить мир, если ему поверит. Ему не нужна власть над миром, он никогда не выставляет на показ свои способности и не хвастает ими, а всегда отзывается о них с чрезвычайной сдержанностью, если вообще упоминает о них. Когда он совершает заслуживающие одобрения поступки, возможно, помогая своему ближнему, он не заботится о том, чтобы о его поступке стало известно. Он обычно поступает по принципу «Пусть левая рука твоя не знает, что делает правая».

Слепой не видит цвета и света, хотя они всегда рядом с ним, и, если бы он пришел к нам и попросил нас подвергнуться проверке, которая доказала бы ему без всякого сомнения, что мы воспринимаем цвет и свет, нам бы было странно слышать, что проверка может убедить его в этом. Так и для обученного ясновидящего странно, что проверки могут убедить каждого. Пока еще не было разработано проверки, которая не давала бы возможности иного толкования разыми людьми, и несчастный ясновидящий, который обрек бы себя на подобные проверки, вынужден был бы их продолжать опять и опять до бесконечности, и тем не менее все новые толпы скептиков объявляли бы его мошенником. От него бы потребовали, чтобы он прошел проверку у каждого незначительного ученого, а ученые не верят даже своим собственным глазам. Если они логически выводят, что что-то невозможно, они отказываются в это верить, хотя это можно увидеть. Ученые вынуждены довольствоваться экспериментами, подчиняющимися законам природы, проводя свои исследования в области химии и других наук, о которых они кое-что знают, но присваивают себе право диктовать условия, когда они изучают сверхфизические вопросы, в которых они, по собственному признанию, невежественны. Когда медиумам требуется затемненная комната для их экспериментов, ученые обычно говорят: «О, конечно, это сразу выявляет в них мошенников; им нужна затемненная комната, чтобы невозможно было обнаружить их обман». Обычно медиумы не знают, почему комната должна быть затемнена, и не могут этого объяснить, но в основе требований медиумов лежит закон.

Он заключается в следующем: Лучи света приводят эфир в сильную вибрацию и затрудняют при таких условиях работу сущности, которая вступает во взаимодействие, процесс ее оформления в тело, голос, руку или другое материальное проявление. Чем более затемнена комната, тем меньше вибрации эфира и тем легче для этих сущностей использовать его, как требуется для спиритического явления.

Существует много других законов, воздействующих на сверхфизические явления, о которых наука не имеет представления, и это незнание сразу же лишает ученых права устанавливать условия. Однако для них всегда есть возможность узнать из первоисточника. Они говорят нам, что можно достать набор линз, отшлифованных определенным образом, поместить их в трубку особым образом, направить эту трубку с линзами в определенном направлении на небо, и вы увидите, как восемь лун вращаются вокруг Сатурна. Если мы последуем их указаниям, мы убедимся, что то, о чем они говорили, можно там обнаружить. Если мы откажемся использовать указанный инструмент, мы не сможем увидеть спутники Сатурна. Мы говорим им: «Просто живите и делайте упражнения, и вы сможете развить в себе способность, о которой мы говорим. Тогда вы увидите, что мы говорили правду, и вы будете вынуждены утверждать то, что утверждаем мы». Если они не хотят следовать нашим указаниям, они могут остаться при своем мнении об области сверхфизического, как человек, который, не собрав телескопа, может сомневаться в существовании спутников Сатурна и относительно всего, что интересует обученных ясновидящих.

### <h3 id="question-133">Вопрос 133</h3>

Если ясновидение такой точный способ исследования, такая великолепная духовная способность, почему мы так часто видим, что ей обладают малообразованные и плохо воспитанные люди, у которых как кажется, низкая духовность и которые часто обманывают?

Ответ: В далеком, далеком прошлом человеческое тело было гораздо менее сложным организмом, чем сейчас, и спинномозговая нервная система, дающая человеку осознанный контроль над своим телом, еще не развилась. В то время симпатическая, или непроизвольная, нервная система обслуживала чисто животные функции, во многом как она обслуживает их и в наше время. Тогда человек был более духовным существом, чем сейчас, и он воспринимал Духовные миры посредством органов, которые сейчас временно не используются. В нашем теле есть несколько органов, находящихся на разной стадии развития; некоторые из них атрофируются, потому что отслужили свое. Мышцы, приводящие в движение уши у животных, например, также есть и у человека, но они больше не нужны и потому большинство из нас потеряло способность их использовать. Другие органы еще только развиваются, например сердце, которое является непроизвольной мышцей, окруженной, однако, поперечными полосами произвольных мышц, которые в будущем дадут возможность управлять сердцем с любой желаемой скоростью.

Другой класс органов просто находится в состоянии покоя, и среди них — гипофиз и шишковидная железа. Если бы их не надо было использовать в будущем, они бы обязательно атрофировались, как это происходит со всеми другими органами, когда их перестают использовать. В далеком прошлом эти органы были соединены с симпатической системой и давали человеку способность непроизвольного ясновидения. Благодаря своей связи со спинномозговой системой в будущем они дадут возможность человечеству осуществлять контакт с Духовными мирами по собственной воле.

Легче скатить камень с горы, чем вкатить его на гору; обратное движение осуществляется гораздо легче, чем движение вперед, и, если люди добиваются развития в негативном направлении, они с легкостью возрождают негативную деятельность гипофиза и шишковидной железы и становятся негативными ясновидящими. Но как любая способность, которая осуществляется посредством непроизвольной нервной системы, не может осуществляться силой воли, эта способность также проявляется у медиумов от случая к случаю. Когда сила действует, они могут ограниченно взаимодействовать с Духовными мирами. А когда сила не действует, они не могут видеть. Поэтому они часто притворяются, чтобы заработать необходимый гонорар.

Человек, сознательно развивающий свои духовные способности, управляет вибрациями двух маленьких органов силой воли, и у него нет «прогулов». Он обладает силой видеть всегда и в любое время. В его руках ясновидение является точным способом исследования, однако необходимо понять, что, как в нашем мире необходимо исследовать, чтобы знать, так и в том мире. Многие люди выражают безрассудный скептицизм относительно существования сверхфизических миров и чувств, но те, кто думает, что, если человек «видит» в невидимых мирах, он тут же все о них знает, в той же степени безрассудны. Слепой человек, получивший способность видеть в результате операции, дает нам пример того, что мы должны учиться видеть здесь, в Физическом мире. Сначала он очень часто закрывает глаза, говоря, что легче ходить на ощупь, чем когда видишь, потому что он еще не научился оценивать расстояния. Младенец, протягивающий ручки к лунному свету или к чему-то на другой стороне комнаты, также демонстрирует это явление. Как вверху, так и внизу; прежде чем человек выучится, одна способность видеть приносит ему мало пользы. И представление о том, что поскольку он видит, то обязательно все понимает, беспочвенно. Мы, видевшие здесь все свои жизни, не знаем всего обо всем в этом мире; также и те, кто «видит» другой мир, не знают всего о нем. Кроме того, здесь формы постоянны, и они не могут с легкостью изменяться, тогда как предмет рассмотрения и знания во внутренних мирах затруднен из-за пластичности форм, так как очень часто они меняются в мгновение ока в ответ на мысли действующих там существ.

Развить ясновидение по своей воле — это трудная задача, и поэтому этой способностью обладают немногие, тогда как негативное ясновидение, к сожалению, развили многие, не обладавшие высокими идеалами, не позволяющими поддаться соблазну продажи своей способности за золото.

### <h3 id="question-134">Вопрос 134</h3>

Что вы подразумеваете под Посвящением, и почему Посвященные — только мужчины?

Ответ: Обычным представлением о посвящении является вступление в тайный орден, как правило, с учетом платы за посвящение, но эзотерическое Посвящение абсолютно иное.

Когда человек старается вести более возвышенную жизнь на протяжении некоторого времени, очищает свои проводники умственными, душевными и физическими усилиями, он испускает свет в невидимый мир и накапливает внутреннюю силу. В свое время достигается наивысшая точка, когда его сила должна получить выражение. Тогда в его жизни появляется учитель, который показывает ему силу, выращенную им иногда неосознанно для себя, и способ ее использования. Такая демонстрация называется Посвящением.

Посвящение может происходить в храме или вне его; оно может сопровождаться, а может и не сопровождаться церемонией в зависимости от обстоятельств. Поймите правильно, никакая церемония не может дать кандидату способности, которым Посвящение обучает его пользоваться, так же как и нажатие спускового крючка незаряженного пистолета не способно вызвать выстрел. Церемония Посвящения может оказаться бесполезной, если она не является высшей точкой, ведущей к ученичеству.

Таким образом, очевидно, что Посвящение — неизбежный результат имеющихся заслуг. Его невозможно продать за деньги, хотя нет недостатка в недобросовестных шарлатанах, которые предлагают посвятить любого в эзотерические таинства, о которых они сами ничего не знают. Нет недостатка и в доверчивых простофилях или нечестных людях, надеющихся приобрести темную власть над своим ближним посредством подобной покупки. Если Симон, колдун, заслужил жесткий упрек Петра, попытавшись купить духовную силу за деньги, неудивительно, какого неодобрения заслуживают те, кто объявляет духовные силы товаром для продажи, особенно тогда, когда по самой своей природе они неспособны передать товар, обещанный для продажи.

Спрашивающий находится в заблуждении, считая, что Посвященными являются только мужчины, по крайней мере, в отношении малых Мистерий это не так. Есть Посвященные-женщины, и иногда даже Посвященные в великие Мистерии берут себе женское тело ради особой работы, которую они хотят выполнить. Верно, однако, что те, кто ушел вперед настолько, что способен выбирать себе пол, обычно предпочитают мужское тело, и причину не надо далеко искать. У женщин позитивное жизненное тело, но негативное плотное тело и поэтому оно, будучи таким в настоящее время, является некоторым препятствием для работы в мире. Стремясь к высшим идеалам и ведя благородную жизнь, мы одухотворяем жизненное тело и преобразуем его в душу, которая всегда позитивна — это сила, используемая независимо от пола. И также, когда Посвященный облачен в мужское тело, он полностью позитивен в Физическом мире и имеет больше шансов для продвижение вперед, чем при использовании женского проводника.

### <h3 id="question-135">Вопрос 135

Не является ли долгом того, кто обладает большей информацией о высшей жизни, передавать информацию менее сведущим и помогать им?

Ответ: Конечно, знание — это то, что мы можем дать другим и все же остаться самими собой. Действительно, когда мы помогаем другим, распространяя знания, мы помогаем себе и увеличиваем свой собственный запас. Так как никто действительно не может ничего знать, пока ему не расскажут и он сам не объяснит это кому-то еще, нам следует понять, что, какое бы знание мы ни получили, оно не является нашей исключительной собственностью, но должно использоваться для всеобщего блага. Если мы эгоистично накапливаем знания и отказываемся просвещать остальных, то на нас это подействует подобно тому, как если бы мы продолжали есть физическую пищу, не освободившись от отходов. Наступит момент, когда мы не сможем больше ничего удержать и заболеем. Так же происходит и с людьми, которые получают знания о высшей жизни. Когда они накапливают знания вместо того, чтобы использовать их на благо остальным, они могут стать затворниками или сойти с ума.

### <h3 id="question-136">Вопрос 136</h3>

Какие навыки необходимы, чтобы стать невидимым помощником? Надо ли отдавать всю жизнь духовному устремлению?

Ответ: Нет, совсем нет; в действительности никто не вправе отдавать всю свою жизнь духовному устремлению, пока сначала он не исполнит свои земные обязанности, имеющиеся у него по отношению к другим. Обязанности в семье — это способ стать видимыми помощниками. С другой стороны, на мужчин или женщин, которые уклоняются от своего долга здесь, безусловно, нельзя положиться при выполнении обязанностей в невидимом мире в качестве невидимых помощников.

Поэтому терпение и постоянство в выполнении всех наших земных обязанностей наилучшим образом является первым и самым существенным навыком стремящегося. В качестве следующего навыка мы можем отметить самоконтроль. Поскольку мы живем и работаем в своих плотных телах, наши тела желаний в определенной степени содержатся под контролем посредством заключения в тюрьму плотного физического вещества. Если мы здесь теряем терпение, результат может оказаться очень опасным для нас и для окружающих. Но это ничто по сравнению с риском, сопутствующим потере терпения в другом мире, так как наше тело желаний в приступе раздражительности, как мы знаем, может разрушать наше физическое тело так, что оно будет испытывать недомогание на протяжении недель в результате потери терпения на несколько минут. Но, будучи вне плотного тела, если его силы направлены против кого-то другого, оно может тотчас уничтожить армию.

Знание также является необходимым атрибутом стремящегося. Пока мы не изучим условия посмертия и не ознакомимся со схемой эволюции, не приобретем относительного понимания состава человека и подобных вещей, мы не можем обучать тех, кто имеет меньше информации, и ставить перед нами задачи невидимого помощника и руководителя было бы аналогично тому, чтобы послать невежду преподавать в школе.

Последнее по счету, но не последнее по важности, качество: невидимый помощник должен излучать всеобъемлющую любовь ко всему человечеству. Мы не можем быть бессердечны к страданиям нашего ближнего здесь и одновременно переполняться любовью и желанием помогать в другом мире, подобно тому, как человек, не знавший нот в земной жизни, не может стать искусным музыкантом после своей смерти или приобрести такую страсть к музыке, что он возжелает целую вечность трубить в рог или играть на арфе. Поэтому мы опять повторяем, что, для того чтобы стать невидимым помощником там, мы сначала должны получить право помогать здесь.

### <h3 id="question-137">Вопрос 137</h3>

Какую цель преследует человек, выходя из своего тела?

Ответ: На современной стадии нашей эволюции большая часть человечества привязана к своим телам во время земной жизни. Они помещены в маленькое и узкое окружение, потому что там надо выучить определенные уроки, которые наилучшим образом могут быть усвоены, если не допускать к обозрению практически все остальные места и условия. Но приходит время, когда человек достаточно вырастает в своем знании и для него становится желательным расширение пределов своей активности. Тогда тело становится помехой, путами, которые целесообразно иногда покидать, и, соответственно, Старшие Братья обучают его выходить из тела по собственной воле. В прошлом им самим помогали ушедшие вперед в своем развитии существа с других планет, пока теперь они сами не стали способны обучать менее развитых представителей человечества.

Целью выхода из тела является получение большего знания. Но само по себе это знание лишь средство для достижения цели, а именно помощи другим для их продвижения вперед. Поэтому те, кто способен выходить из тела, известны как невидимые помощники. Их работа заключается в том, чтобы помогать как живым, так и мертвым, в соответствии со своими способностями.

### <h3 id="question-138">Вопрос 138</h3>

Является ли абсолютной необходимостью вести аскетический образ жизни, чтобы стать духовным человеком, наделенным психическими силами?

Ответ: Это зависит от того, что спрашивающий подразумевает под аскетизмом. Некоторые люди на Востоке заползают в бочку с гвоздями и катаются в ней, чтобы умертвить плоть, или хлещут себя, или калечат различными способами, чтобы обрести духовные силы. Подобное поведение, несомненно, неверно. Они могут стать ясновидящими, и иногда им это удается. Но подобное направление так же достойно порицания и так же преходяще, как и результаты, полученные от созерцания кристалла, использования наркотиков и аналогичных методов.

Мы должны осознать, что данное физическое тело — наш самый драгоценный инструмент, и нашей обязанностью является предоставление ему всего необходимого ухода и условий, обеспечивающих его здоровье и благосостояние. Никакая сила, полученная при жестоком обращении с телом, не является силой высокого порядка, поэтому она непродолжительна и неэффективна по своему действию.

Но некоторые люди подразумевают под аскетизмом «чистую и целомудренную жизнь». Они хотят получить духовную силу без принесения в жертву своих животных пристрастий; они жаждут парить в облаках по собственной воле, а в другое время требуют права погрязнуть в болоте. Они хотят продолжать употреблять грубую пищу, набивать живот мясом, алкоголем и табаком, потворствуя своим страстям и чувственным желаниям в любом направлении, и в то же время желают обладать духовными силами.

Подобное невозможно. Наши тела — это наши инструменты. Хороший работник ценит хороший инструмент и содержит его в наилучших условиях — острым и чистым. Когда наши чувства отуманены алкоголем и табаком, когда наша система вынуждена напрягать все свои силы, чтобы переварить или удалить грубую пищу, можно ли ожидать, что человек будет чутким? Нельзя служить Богу и мамоне; выбор за нами. Если мы хотим обрести духовные силы, нам надо заплатить плату чистотой жизни; мы должны давать своему телу чистую пищу и соответствовать правилам простой жизни. Мы должны воздерживаться от всего, что притупляет чувства, — от алкоголя, табака и подобных злоупотреблений. Если такая жизнь называется «аскетической жизнью», тогда аскетизм абсолютно необходим.

### <h3 id="question-139">Вопрос 139</h3>

Все ли дети до определенного возраста являются ясновидящими?

Ответ: Да, все являются ясновидящими, по крайней мере в течение первого года жизни. В большой степени от духовности ребенка, а также от его окружения зависит, как долго он будет сохранять свою способность, так как большинство детей сообщает о том, что видит, старшим, от чьего отношения и зависит сохранение способности к ясновидению. Часто над детьми смеются, и ничто не может больнее ранить их чувствительные маленькие сердца. Вскоре они обучаются закрываться от явлений, которые вызывают насмешки старших, или, по крайней мере, они научаются никого не посвящать в полученный ими опыт. Когда их слушают, они часто демонстрируют удивительные вещи, и иногда бывает возможно проследить предшествующую жизнь по рассказам маленького ребенка. Конечно, в основном подобное происходит, если ребенок умер в малом возрасте в предыдущей жизни, так как тогда он находится в Невидимом мире от одного до двадцати лет, и сообщаемые им сведения можно проверить. Дети, которые в своей предыдущей жизни умерли детьми, в гораздо большей степени способны помнить прошлое и обладать ясновидением, чем другие дети, потому что тело желаний и жизненное тело рождаются не одновременно с физическим рождением ребенка, а в семь и четырнадцать лет соответственно, а то, что не обрело жизнь, не может умереть, так что, если ребенок умирает до рождения своего жизненного тела или тела желаний, он не попадает на Второе и Третье небо, а остается в мире Желаний и будет рожден с тем же самым телом желаний и телом ума, которыми он обладал в предшествующей жизни, и потому будет способен вспомнить, что тогда происходило. Автор натолкнулся на подобный случай несколько лет назад в Южной Калифорнии.

Однажды в Санта Барбаре по улице шел мужчина по имени Робертс, когда к нему подбежал маленький ребенок и обвил своими руками его колени, назвав его папой. Мистер Робертс подумал, что кто-то пытается навязать ему ребенка, и негодующе высвободился. Мать ребенка тоже была возмущена поступком ребенка и забрала его. Но ребенок продолжал кричать: «Это мой папа, это мой папа!» Из-за обстоятельств, которые выяснятся позже, это происшествие терзало мистера Робертса, и он отправился к господину, которого мы назовем X. Вместе они нашли дом, в котором маленький ребенок жил со своими родителями, и после непродолжительного разговора им разрешили задать ребенку вопросы. Как только эта маленькая девочка увидела г-на Робертса, она опять побежала к нему и назвала папой. Потом, отвечая на различные вопросы в течение половины дня, ребенок поведал им историю, которую мы приводим здесь в связном изложении.

Однажды, давным-давно, она жила с г-ном Робертсом в качестве своего отца и другой мамой в маленьком домике у ручья, где росли цветы (здесь она выбежала и принесла вербу). Там были перекинуты через ручей доски, которые ей запрещалось пересекать, чтобы она не упала в воду. Однажды г-н Робертс ушел, оставив их с мамой, и больше не вернулся. Через некоторое время ее мама легла и больше не двигалась. «Она стала очень тихой и умерла». Потом, сказала девочка, «я тоже умерла; но я не умерла, я пришла сюда!»

Потом г-н Робертс рассказал свою историю. Примерно восемнадцать лет назад он жил со своим отцом, пивоваром, в Англии. Он влюбился в девушку-прислугу, но отец не разрешил ему жениться. Молодые люди убежали в Лондон, поженились, поехали в Австралию, где он расчистил от кустов маленькую ферму и построил дом у ручья, где росла верба. Там через ручей были переброшены доски. У них родился ребенок, и однажды, когда ребенку исполнилось примерно два года, г-н Робертс пошел расчищать участок примерно в миле от домика. К нему подошел офицер полиции с ружьем и арестовал его за ограбление банка, совершенное в ночь отъезда из Лондона.

Он протестовал, утверждая, что невиновен, умолял отпустить его проститься с женой и ребенком, чтобы получить возможность позаботиться о них, но офицер боялся попасть в ловушку к его сообщникам и доставил г-на Робертса на побережье под дулом ружья. Его отвезли в Англию и провели следствие об ограблении. Он оказался невиновным. Но до этого момента чиновники не слушали его бредовые речи о жене и ребенке, которые безусловно должны были голодать в дикой местности в Австралии. Была послана телеграмма, организована поисковая партия, и через некоторое время пришел ответ. Были обнаружены скелеты несчастных, после чего г-н Робертс отправился в Америку с разбитым сердцем.

Потом ребенку показали несколько фотографий, бессистемно, среди которых были две фотографии: г-на Робертса и его жены. Внешность г-на Робертса сильно изменилась с того момента, когда были сделаны эти фотографии. Тем не менее, когда фотографии попались ребенку, девочка радостно закричала: «Ой, это папа!» Она также узнала фотографию своей мамы по предыдущей жизни. Маленькой девочке было только три года, когда г-н Робертс встретился с ней, и она вряд ли могла сочинить всю эту историю. В дальнейшем этот случай был расследован одной из известнейших газет Южной Калифорнии, «Лос-Анджелес Таймс», и факты подтвердились.

### <h3 id="question-140">Вопрос 140</h3>

В чем различия черной и белой магии, и каковы следствия для души от использования черной магии?

Ответ: Магия — это процесс, посредством которого мы можем получить результаты, недостижимые при использовании известных всем законов. Некоторые люди исследовали законы природы, не известные большинству, и стали адептами в управлении тонкими силами. Они использовали свое могущество для помощи ближним, когда это позволяла стадия их развития. Другие, изучив законы и овладев способностью управлять скрытыми силами вселенной, используют свои знания для эгоистических целей, чтобы обрести власть над ближними. Упомянутый первым класс — это белые маги, второй класс — черные маги. Оба эти класса используют одни и те же силы и управляют ими, разница заключается лишь в побудительном мотиве. Побудительной причиной для белого мага являются любовь и благожелательность. Хотя мысли о награде и не входят в число его стимулов, у него можно наблюдать удивительный рост души в результате применения магии. Он отдает свои таланты в оборот и получает прибыль в стократном размере. С другой стороны, черный маг находится в печальном положении, так как сказано: «Душа согрешившая умрет», и все, что мы делаем вопреки законам Бога, неизбежно выливается в ухудшение душевных качеств.

Черный маг своими знаниями и искусством может иногда на протяжении нескольких жизней сохранять свое положение в процессе эволюции, но приходит время, когда душа распадается на составные элементы и Эго возвращается к тому состоянию, которое мы можем назвать состоянием первозданности. Малые формы черной магии, такие, например, как гипноз, иногда вызывают врожденный идиотизм в будущей жизни. Гипнотизер лишает своих жертв возможности свободно использовать свои тела. По закону Следствий он потом оказывается привязанным к телу с уродливым мозгом, который лишает его способности самовыражения. Однако нам не следует делать вывод, что каждый случай врожденного идиотизма является следствием подобного злодеяния со стороны Эго в прошлой жизни; есть и другие причины, которые могут привести к врожденному идиотизму.

### <h3 id="question-141">Вопрос 141</h3>

Вы говорите о западной и восточной эзотерических школах. Не является ли западная школа лучшей из них, и если так, то почему?

Ответ: В настоящее время на Земле существует много различных рас. Индусы — это первая раса нынешней Арийской эпохи, а англосаксы — пятая. Естественно, самое передовое знание дается людям, которые дальше всех ушли вперед в своем развитии. Поэтому западная религия, христианство, гораздо выше индуизма и буддизма. Также и тайные учения Востока не являются передовыми, в отличие от учений Запада. На Востоке большой акцент делается на подчинении тела, чтобы взращивать духовные способности. Тамошние стремящиеся принимают определенные позы, выполняя трудные дыхательные и физические упражнения, которые не являются необходимыми при западном методе. На самом деле тело западного человека абсолютно не поддается подобным приемам. Кроме того, на Востоке ученик находится под полным контролем наставника, которого он зовет Учителем и требования которого он должен выполнять в малейших деталях, не спрашивая «для чего». На Западе мы следуем учению Христа, который говорил своим ученикам: «Я уже не называю вас рабами, ибо раб не знает, что делает господин его; но Я назвал вас друзьями, потому что сказал вам все, что слышал от Отца Моего» (Ин., 15:15). Поэтому учитель на Западе находится со своим учеником в самых близких дружеских отношениях и всегда готов ответить на его вопрос настолько, насколько это совместимо с его стадией развития.

Безусловно, на Востоке есть люди, далеко ушедшие вперед в изучении доктрины своей школы, но западная методика обычно позволяет достичь соответствующей ступени за более короткий отрезок времени и с меньшими усилиями.

### <h3 id="question-142">Вопрос 142</h3>

В чем различие между эфирным видением, ясновидением и видением, относящимся к миру Мысли?

Ответ: Когда мы смотрим на человека, используя эфирное видение, мы сначала видим его одежду, затем его кожу, различные органы его тела, расположенные вдоль направления видения; затем позвоночник, внутреннюю поверхность ребер, плоть, кожу и одежду с другой стороны тела. Другими словами, мы видим через него. С помощью эфирного зрения человек может видеть сквозь книги, бумагу, письма, стены или что-либо другое на небольшом расстоянии. На самом деле данную способность можно назвать «рентгеновским зрением». Лишь одно вещество устойчиво к этой проникающей способности. Стекло так же непрозрачно для эфирного зрения, как каменная стена для обычного физического зрения, возможно, по той же причине, по которой стекло является прекрасным изолятором для электричества.

Когда мы смотрим на человека или на вещь с помощью обычного ясновидения, мы видим их тела желаний и двойники их остальных проводников изнутри и снаружи — каждую частицу в один и тот же момент. Читать книгу или даже письмо, используя эфирное видение, достаточно трудно, потому что мы должны смотреть сквозь другие страницы, которые затуманивают интересующую нас страницу. Когда мы используем обычное ясновидение, кажется, будто книга или письмо развертывается, так что мы можем прочесть любую страницу или часть, и при этом нам не надо смотреть сквозь другие части. Но когда мы смотрим на объект с помощью видения, относящегося к четырем нижним областям мира Мысли, а автор не обладает знанием более высоких сфер, вместо фигур мы обнаруживаем полые пространства, или матрицы, которые говорят с нами и рассказывают о себе. Необходимость исследования в этом мире отсутствует. Здесь мы мгновенно узнаем все о любом интересующем нас объекте. Однако полученные таким образом знания обладают одним удивительным недостатком — они открываются сразу все. Сумма этих знаний — единое целое, не имеющее ни начала, ни конца. И обычно поэтому геркулесова задача заключается в том, чтобы развернуть это знание в упорядоченную, последовательную концепцию, которую можно полностью изложить себе и другим.

### <h3 id="question-143">Вопрос 143</h3>

Безопасно ли для человека с ослабленными нервами проходить эзотерическое обучение у розенкрейцеров или для такого человека необходимо сначала выздороветь? Восстанавливается ли эзотерическим обучением здоровье?

Ответ: Единственные упражнения, которые розенкрейцеры давали открыто, — это утренние и вечерние упражнения. Вечерние упражнения заключаются в просмотре событий дня в обратном порядке. Во время подобного обзора стремящийся способствует развитию чувства самого искреннего раскаяния за дурные поступки, а также чувства огромной радости, когда исправляет свое поведение в каждой ситуации во время прошедшего дня. Утреннее упражнение заключается в концентрации на высоком идеале, например, на Христе.

Если человек нервного склада будет стараться спокойно и тихо выполнять эти упражнения, он получит чрезвычайно благотворный результат, в особенности если он постарается расслаблять каждый мускул тела во время упражнений.

Поза кота, который сторожит мышиную нору, преподносит нам чудесный поясняющий пример расслабления. Кот сидит в совершенно удобном положении, тихо и спокойно он ожидает появления мыши. Ни капли энергии не тратится на раздражение и нетерпение. Он упорно продолжает ждать, веря, что рано или поздно ему представится возможность. Он сохраняет всю свою энергию для высочайшего момента, когда он прыгнет, чтобы овладеть своей добычей. Если ученик полностью расслабит свои мышцы, тихо и спокойно просмотрит события дня во время вечернего упражнения и сконцентрируется на высшем идеале во время утреннего упражнения, нервозность постепенно исчезнет и однажды ему представится возможность развить духовное видение.

### <h3 id="question-144">Вопрос 144</h3>

Здоровое тело необходимо для духовного развития; что предлагает учение розенкрейцеров тому, чье физическое состояние в настоящее время оставляет желать лучшего? Будет ли прекрасное здоровье одним из результатов изучения этого учения, и, если это учение будет практиковаться, будет ли оно способствовать поддержанию хорошего здоровья?

Ответ: Спрашивающий начинает с неверной идеи о том, что здоровое тело необходимо для настоящего духовного развития и, возможно, также забывает о различии между здоровым и чувствительным телом. Многие люди низкого развития обладают очень здоровым физическим телом, но абсолютно нечувствительны к духовным вибрациям. Пример пояснит вышесказанное: у автора на протяжении рядя лет был будильник, дешевые часы. Много раз они паковались в чемоданы, с которыми носильщики и грузчики управлялись весьма небрежно, и все же, когда их вынимали из чемодана после всех встрясок и ужасного обращения, они все-таки шли и кое-как показывали время, с небольшим отклонением в ту или иную сторону. Такие часы — крепкие, прочные, но неточные.

С другой стороны, хронометр, который используется на борту кораблей, — это чрезвычайно чувствительные часы. Они покоятся на весах, которые постоянно поддерживают их в горизонтальном положении и компенсируют малейшие движения корабля с тем, чтобы хронометр мог показывать абсолютно точное время, так как тысячи жизней зависят от точности этого прибора. Капитан, отправившись в неизвестные воды океана, знает, насколько далеко к востоку или западу он находится от Гринвича в Англии, благодаря этим точным часам — хронометру. Когда он рассчитывает разницу между зенитом своего местоположения и временем, которое показывает ему хронометр, он получает точный критерий своего местоположения, критерий, которому он доверяет жизни всех пассажиров и сохранность товара на миллионы долларов, находящегося на его попечении. Сравнение чувствительного хронометра и грубого будильника иллюстрирует разницу между «чувствительным» и «крепким, здоровым».

Когда мы постигаем высшие учения, ведем жизнь, которой они нас учат, наше тело становится чрезвычайно чувствительным и требует большей заботы, чем тело индейца или негра в диких просторах Африки. Они не обладают столь тонко организованной нервной системой, как белая раса. Те, кто заинтересован в духовном развитии, легко возбудимы, очень чувствительны и поэтому по мере нашего продвижения вперед нам надо все больше и больше заботиться о своем инструменте. Но также мы изучаем законы телесной природы и то, как с ними согласовывать свои действия. Если применять наши знания, то мы сможем стать обладателями чувствительного инструмента и содержать его относительно здоровым.

Однако есть случаи, когда болезнь необходима для определенных изменений в теле, которые являются предшественниками более высокой ступени духовного развития. И при таких условиях болезнь, конечно, благословение, а не проклятие. Тем не менее в общем можно сказать, что изучение высшей философии всегда приводит к улучшению здоровья, потому что «знание — сила», и, чем больше мы знаем, тем лучше мы можем справиться со всеми обстоятельствами, если только, конечно, мы используем наши знания на практике и внедряем их в жизнь. То есть мы не только слушаем слово, но и исполняем его, так как никакое учение не принесет нам пользы, пока оно не внедрено в жизнь и не проживается день за днем.

### <h3 id="question-145">Вопрос 145</h3>

Каким образом нам поможет в посмертии развитие ясновидения в настоящей жизни?

Ответ: Несколькими путями. Во-первых, у многих людей есть большой страх смерти; малейшее упоминание слова «смерть» вызывает у них появление мурашек на спине, как от холода, и они всегда избегают говорить на эту тему. Страх смерти порождает мыслеформы отвратительного характера, и, когда человек покидает тело во время смерти, чтобы вступить в Невидимый мир, он видит эти ужасные формы вокруг себя как множество демонов, и иногда они подталкивают его к душевному заболеванию. Тем не менее они являются его детищем, и он не может избавиться от них, пока не узнает, что у них нет над ним власти, и бесстрашно не прогонит их. Тогда они исчезают, как роса на солнце.

Человека, развивавшего ясновидение во время земной жизни, тоже иногда при первом вступлении в Невидимый мир мучают различные элементальные сущности, принимающие самые устрашающие формы. Они признают в неофите возможного будущего хозяина и стремятся отклонить его от цели запугиванием, но, так как ему обычно помогает учитель и он знает, что эти существа не имеют над ним власти, он очень быстро преодолевает страх. Когда позднее он покидает свое тело во время смерти и вступает в Невидимый мир, он уже знаком со многими образами и явлениями этого мира; кроме того, у него нет страха, который мог бы ему мешать.

### <h3 id="question-146">Вопрос 146</h3>

Помогает ли внутреннее созерцание Бога, если оно выполняется настойчиво, духовному росту и приведет ли к мастерству?

Ответ: В настоящее время мы живем в повседневности западного мира, где наш долг заключается в том, чтобы занимать то место, которое является нашим. У каждого из нас есть работа, которую мы должны выполнять, и, если мы уклоняемся от нее для болезненного самоанализа, мы не только не вырастем, но и духовно деградируем. Некоторые люди, к сожалению, думают, что у них есть оправдание для того, чтобы оставить свои земные обязанности, когда, как им кажется, их зовет духовное продвижение. Но пока мы не исполним здесь свой долг, не может быть никакого истинного духовного продвижения; все, что может показаться духовным продвижением, в конце концов обернется в пыль и прах.

Страны Востока преподносят нам ужасный пример губительных результатов пренебрежения материальными обязанностями ради беспорядочных поисков того, что они воображают духовной силой. Там люди истощают и уродуют свои тела, например, следующим упражнением: держат руку над головой, пока она не усыхает. Подобное не является истинной духовностью и не способствует благу всего мира. Говорят: «Всяк сверчок знай свой шесток», «Всякий человек своим умом живет». Но верно также и то, что все, что не способствует общему подъему, никогда никого не поднимет. Глубокое и искреннее желание способствовать всеобщему благу — единственное веское оправдание для увеличения усилий, способствующих развитию духовной силы. Рассказывают о матерях, посещающих женские собрания, чтобы обсудить, как лучше всего заботиться о доме и о детях, в то время как дети остаются в неубранном доме без присмотра.

Подобные истории — не преувеличение и не шутка, в них больше правды, чем вымысла. И люди, которые болтают о духовности и жаждут созерцать внутреннего ангела, пренебрегая своими семьями и другими очевидными обязанностями, находятся на одном уровне с подобными матерями. Чем быстрее мы пробудимся к осознанию того факта, что ни одной самой скромной своей обязанностью нельзя пренебречь безнаказанно для духовной работы, какой бы возвышенной она ни была, тем будет лучше для нас самим и всех, кто связан с нами.

Мы бы посоветовали спрашивающему прочесть стихотворение Лонгфелло «Прекрасная легенда». Она чрезвычайно точно поясняет наш ответ: монах преклоняет колена на каменном полу, и вдруг перед ним появляется прекрасный образ Христа, как раз в тот момент, когда полуденный колокол призывает его к воротам, где нищие ожидают милостыню, подавать которую каждый день является его обязанностью. У монаха возникает мысленный вопрос, остаться ли ему для беседы со святым Гостем или оставить Его ради кучки голодных нищих? Но внутренний голос ему говорит: «Долг спеши исполнить свой, в остальном — Господь с тобой!»

Он следует приказанию голоса, оставляя Образ в келье и беспокоясь, найдет ли он там Его по возвращении. Тем не менее он чувствовал, что правильно будет исполнить свои обязанности по отношению к другим независимо от собственных потерь. И когда после раздачи милостыни бедным он возвращается в свою келью, Образ приветствует его словами: «Если б ты со мной остался, так пришлось бы мне уйти!»

### <h3 id="question-147">Вопрос 147</h3>

Разве не было написано, что определенные индивидуумы развили духовную силу, ясновидение, шестое чувство и другие подобные качества, ведя чистую жизнь в гармонии с законами природы, и не имеют ли современные эзотерики с их большим багажом специальных терминов склонности вызывать неразбериху в большей степени, нежели приходить к желаемым результатам?

Ответ: Путь развития во всех случаях зависит от характера стремящегося. Существует два пути — мистический и интеллектуальный. Идущий по мистическому пути обычно лишен интеллектуального знания; он следует велению сердца и стремится выполнять волю Бога, как он ее чувствует, поднимаясь вверх без осознания какой-либо определенной цели, и в конце приобретает знание. В Средние века люди не были такими интеллектуальными, как мы сейчас, и те, кто чувствовал зов высшей жизни, обычно следовали по мистическому пути. Но в течение последних нескольких столетий, с появлением современной науки, Землю населило более интеллектуальное человечество. Голова окончательно одержала верх над сердцем, материализм возобладал над всеми духовными импульсами, и большинство думающих людей не верит в то, что оно не может потрогать, попробовать и подержать. Поэтому необходимо взывать к их разуму, чтобы сердце могло верить в то, во что разрешит разум. В ответ на эту потребность современные эзотерические системы стремятся соотносить научные факты с духовными истинами. Конечно, материалистические умонастроения особенно сильны на Западе. Орден розенкрейцеров был основан в XIII веке, чтобы подготовить противоядие от материализма, которое можно было бы принимать в достаточных для сложившейся ситуации дозах. Парацельс, Комениус, Гельмонд, Бекон и другие в более завуалированном виде дали учения, которые теперь полностью обнародованы, чтобы доказать, что наука, искусство и религия являются триединством, которое нельзя разделить, не исказив наше восприятие.

Истинная религия воплощает в себе как науку, так и искусство, ибо учит нас прекрасной жизни в гармонии с законами природы.

Истинная наука артистична и религиозна в высшем смысле, ибо учит нас уважать законы, управляющие нашим благосостоянием, и жить в согласии с ними; она объясняет, почему религиозная жизнь приводит к здоровью и красоте.

Истинное искусство так же дает образование, как наука, и так же духовно возвышает своим воздействием, как религия. В архитектуре мы видим наиболее совершенный способ представления космических направлений силы во вселенной. Она наполняет духовного созерцателя мощным религиозным чувством и восхищением, порожденным повергающей в трепет концепцией безграничного великолепия и могущества Бога. Скульптура и живопись, музыка и литература вселяют в нас чувство необыкновенной красоты Бога, неизменного источника и цели всего этого прекрасного мира.

Любой сокращенный вариант этого всеобъемлющего триединого учения не отвечает нуждам большого растущего класса, поэтому в настоящее время абсолютно необходима религия, уважительная по отношению к технике.

### <h3 id="question-148">Вопрос 148</h3>

Можно ли развивать ясновидение с помощью наркотиков, созерцания кристалла или дыхательными упражнениями, не приносят ли эти методы результаты быстрее, чем методы, которые отстаиваете вы?

Ответ: Да, при помощи любого из упомянутых способов можно развить определенный вид ясновидения, но, когда человек развивает шестое чувство подобными способами, он не становится хозяином своей способности; возможность порождать феномен ясновидения переходит к кристаллу, а не к человеку. Он находится в том же положении, что и человек, который изучает искусство верховой езды в академии, где лошадей обучают, чтобы они разрешали на себе ездить. Ученики не имеют возможности бороться с непокорными животными, а просто ездят на послушных лошадях.

Если человек сумел приучить к поводьям одну дикую лошадь, он сможет приучить и остальных и ездить верхом благодаря своей собственной способности приручать свою лошадь. Когда человек использует вместо наркотиков или кристалла свою способность, чтобы подчинить свое тело и развить ясновидение, он приобретает душевные качества, позволяющие ему использовать свою способность во всех будущих жизнях. Но как созерцатель кристалла, так и наркоман теряют свою способность во время смерти и должны ждать, пока у них появится наркотик или кристалл в новой жизни, чтобы научить их применению новое тело. Таким образом, в результате использования подобных методов происходит огромная потеря времени и сил. Если принять во внимание, что наркотики и дыхательные упражнения разрушающе действуют на тело, станет ясно, что эти методы совершенно нежелательны. Многие сегодня оказались в сумасшедшем доме или в могиле из-за туберкулеза по причине дыхательных упражнений; губительное действие наркотиков тоже широко известно.

Кроме того, существует много видов ясновидения. У некоторых есть способность такой природы, что ясновидящий может быть уподоблен заключенному, сидящему в камере за решеткой. Из окна его камеры открывается только определенный вид; он не может избежать созерцания того, что попадает в поле его зрения, так как он не может от этого отгородиться. У его окна также есть ставни, которыми он тоже не может управлять. Так, всегда, когда ставни открыты, он должен смотреть на то, что проходит перед его окном снаружи, нравится ли ему это зрелище или нет. Способность подобного рода является настоящим проклятием, так как иногда перед взором ясновидящего разыгрываются самые ужасные события. Автор помнит, что случилось с одним господином, обладавшим таким видом ясновидения. Когда он читал лекцию в одном обществе во время войны на Филиппинах, перед его взором возникла сцена битвы. Схватка происходила в тот момент между филиппинцами и нашими солдатами. Он увидел лошадей с распоротыми животами и вываливающимися на землю внутренностями, наших людей, изрубленных в куски кривыми филиппинскими ножами, и прочие подобные картины. Не имея возможности отгородиться от видения, он смертельно побледнел, и лишь огромным усилием воли ему удалось закончить лекцию, не привлекая внимания основной аудитории.

Есть и другие ясновидящие, которые могут лишь частично управлять своим видением, не имея возможности положиться на свою способность в любое время. К этому классу относятся обычные медиумы, которые продают свою способность за деньги. Пока их способности действенны, они могут дать чрезвычайно ценную информацию и говорить правду, но в остальное время, когда их способность не действует, у них может возникнуть искушение обеспечить себе заработок, необходимый для оплаты помещения и личных нужд, просто имитируя ее. Единственный безопасный путь развития способности ясновидения — это упражнения, данные школами Мистерий, но эти упражнения и уроки никогда не продаются за золото или за любые другие материальные блага. Они всегда даруются без денег как награда за заслуги. Человек, у которого есть эта способность, развитая по их методу, работает «без выходных», но он никогда не согласится использовать свою способность, чтобы удовлетворить чье-нибудь любопытство ради проверки или другой легкомысленной цели. Он направляет все свои силы для достижения духовного подъема человечества.

### <h3 id="question-149">Вопрос 149</h3>

Какое время утром лучше всего для концентрации?

Ответ: Целью упражнений, как утренних, так и вечерних, является приведение ученика в сознательное соприкосновение с невидимыми мирами, и нет лучше времени, чем утро, так как ночью дух покидает плотное тело и вступает в невидимый мир, оставляя спящее тело на постели. Именно возвращение духа утром вызывает пробуждение тела и фокусирует наше сознание на материальном мире посредством органов чувств. В своей прекрасной «Оде к бессмертию» Вордсворт говорит:

    Рожденье наше — сон лишь и забвенье,  
    А с нами восходящая Душа — Звезда всей жизни,  
    Чей закат был в отдаленье,  
    И к нам она пришла издалека:  
    Не в наготе, забывчивости полной,  
    А обернувшись в славы облака,  
    Приходим мы от Господа — Он Дом наш:  
    Нас в детстве окружают Небеса!  
      
    Сгущаться стали тени заточенья  
    Над сыном, пока он растет,  
    Но Он видит свет, и свет этот льющийся  
    Радость ему несет.  
      
    А Юность, Природы послушная Жрица,  
    Вдаль от Востока должна идти  
    С роем видений дивных,  
    Кружащихся на пути.  
      
    Но прозревает человек, и все виденья тают,  
    И к свету будничного дня он взор свой обращает.  

На протяжении жизни человека внутренние миры ближе всего ему в детстве, по словам Вордсворта, так как это утро жизни. Так же и для нас: пробуждаясь утром, мы находимся в более тесном соприкосновении с Духовными мирами, чем в любое другое время суток, и тогда легче всего к ним вернуться. Поэтому ученик должен начинать свои упражнения в самый первый момент после пробуждения, не позволяя своему уму остановиться на чем-то еще. Ему следует тщательно и полностью расслабить свое тело так, чтобы ни один мускул не был напряжен, и сосредоточить свой ум на высшем идеале или на первых пяти строчках Евангелия от Иоанна, либо предложение за предложением, либо целиком. Это упражнение приведет его в соприкосновение с космическими вибрациями. Ему следует успокоить чувства настолько, чтобы он ничего не слышал и не видел в комнате. Когда он достигнет цели, перед его внутренним взором предстанут образы мира Желаний. Поначалу отрывисто, потом более и более ясно, поскольку практика совершенствует способность ученика.

Для большинства тем не менее вечернее упражнение имеет большее значение, и, возможно, оно быстрее принесет результаты, потому что работа над своей жизнью облагораживает нас так, как не может облагородить утреннее упражнение.

### <h3 id="question-150">Вопрос 150</h3>

Мне трудно просматривать события дня в обратном порядке, когда я делаю вечернее упражнение. Является ли это абсолютно необходимым, и если да, то почему?

Ответ: Во время вечернего упражнения ученик делает просмотр и оценивает свою жизнь за этот день. Он обычно выполняет работу, остающуюся для чистилища и Первого неба. Там жизнь проживается в обратном порядке от следствий к причинам, то есть в том порядке, который позволяет нам видеть, как и почему страдание становится следствием наших ошибок. Просматривая нашу ежедневную жизнь в обратном порядке, от следствий к причинам, мы замечаем, что все наши беды и переживания были вызваны предыдущими действиями во время предшествующего дня или в какой-то другой день нашей жизни.

Наша задача — найти и проанализировать причину, которая привела к конкретному результату, чтобы мы знали на будущее, как использовать возможности для духовного роста и как избегать зла. Так, если мы прослеживаем до конца события дня в обратном порядке, мы извлекаем пользу из полученного опыта прямо сейчас, вместо того чтобы дожидаться, пока мы умрем и будем вынуждены пожинать плоды своих дел в чистилище и на Первом небе.

### <h3 id="question-151">Вопрос 151</h3>

Какова ценность дыхательных упражнений в развитии тела и ума?

Ответ: Ценность дыхательных упражнений зависит от знаний человека, который их преподает. Дыхательные упражнения, взятые из книг и преподнесенные так называемыми учителями, которые дают объявления о курсах психического развития, представляют огромную опасность, и многие люди оказались в сумасшедшем доме из-за попыток их использовать или, возможно, спят под могильным холмом, истощенные болезнью.

Каждое человеческое существо — индивидуально и требует индивидуальных упражнений. Подходящие упражнения может дать только человек, обладающий ясновидением, а также способностью наблюдать рост определенных эфирных органов в физическом теле своего ученика. Он, кроме того, должен знать, каким будет этот рост в каждом индивидуальном случае. Любой, у кого есть способности давать такие упражнения, также знает, как определить нежелательное развитие. Но подобный учитель не дает объявлений о развитии психических способностей по такой-то цене за урок. Информация об этих упражнениях никогда не продается за деньги, а всегда дается за заслуги.

Причина очевидна. Обладающий способностью ясновидения имеет в своем распоряжении большую силу; при неправильном употреблении она может причинить больше вреда, чем любое земное оружие. Она может вызвать панику на мировых рынках, войны и вражду между людьми повсеместно. Обладатель этой силы стал бы бедствием для общества, если бы он не обладал разумом, позволяющим использовать эту способность только во благо. Силы, стоящие за эволюцией, Старшие Братья человечества, развившие эти силы и способные им обучать, очень тщательно заботятся о том, чтобы никто не смог добраться до этой силы, пока не предъявит доказательства бескорыстия и не свяжет себя клятвами и ограничениями. Поэтому можно сказать, что никому не следует делать дыхательные упражнения, если они не предписаны настоящим учителем, нет также необходимости носиться во всему свету в поисках такого учителя. Стремящийся должен стараться делать добро и использовать свои способности, которыми он обладает сейчас в своем окружении, так как это единственная ступенька к более высоким способностям. Когда он достаточно подготовится, в его жизни появится учитель и он ни на мгновение не усомнится в истинности данного ему учения. В связи с этим можно процитировать небольшое и удивительно красивое стихотворение:
  
    Не будем терять свое время в мечтанье,  
    Чтобы несбыточно-яркое совершить.  
    Не будем сидеть в пустом ожиданье,  
    Чтобы рост ангельских крыл ощутить.  
    Не будем смеяться над свечки значеньем,  
    Ведь каждый звездою не может быть,  
    Но лучше исполним свое назначенье —  
    Чтоб просто здесь свет свой дарить.  
    Есть потребность и в маленькой свечке,  
    Как и в Солнца палящем луче;  
    Станет важным скромнейшее дело,  
    Если труд твой с любовью в душе.  
    Может быть, не пошлют нам зов дали  
    Свет небесный во тьму их принесть,  
    Так исполним свое назначенье  
    Просто свет дарить там, где мы есть.  
  
### <h3 id="question-152">Вопрос 152</h3>

Не слишком ли нереален и призрачен Невидимый мир, о котором вы говорите, по сравнению с этим миром, в котором мы сейчас живем?

Ответ: Бог — это Высшая Реальность. Мир Желаний и мир Мысли — это первый и второй шаг к этому центральному источнику энергии, и поэтому они более реальны. Под словом «реальный» спрашивающий, должно быть, подразумевает, что в этом мире формы стабильны и с трудом изменяются, тогда как в Невидимых мирах они более чем пластичны и изменяются со скоростью мысли. Но жизнь — это реальность, а не форма. Стабильность не является признаком реальности. Все в мире, что сейчас закристаллизовано и стабильно, сначала существовало в пластичных условиях Невидимого мира. Все, что сделано руками человека, сначала было мыслеформой в уме своего создателя.

Когда архитектор хочет построить дом, сначала он все продумывает. Он стремится создать образ того, каким будет дом, так четко, как только можно. Если бы рабочие могли видеть мыслеформу в уме архитектора, они бы могли работать с ней без чертежей, но идея архитектора спрятана от них завесой плоти, поэтому для архитектора необходимо изложить свою идею на бумаге и сделать план. Это первая стадия кристаллизации; а потом рабочие строят дом из железа, дерева и камня.

В соответствии с представлениями большинства людей этот дом гораздо более реален, чем мыслеформа в уме архитектора, но в действительности это не так. Бетонный дом может быть разрушен в одно мгновение землетрясением, динамитом или другими способами, но мысленный образ в уме архитектора будет существовать столько же, сколько проживет архитектор, и по этому образу можно построить в любое время новый дом или дюжину новых домов. Даже после смерти архитектора дом все еще будет существовать как модель в эфире, и любой ясновидящий, способный входить в контакт с Невидимыми мирами и читать в памяти Природы, сможет увидеть ее там в любое время, даже если пролетят миллионы лет. Таким образом, Невидимый мир — это источник и вечная запись всего, что есть или было здесь, поэтому он является исходной реальностью.

<h2 id="section-7">Часть VII - Астрология</h2>

### <h3 id="question-153">Вопрос 153</h3>

Могут ли астрология и хиромантия быть достоверны настолько, чтобы мы могли предотвратить беду, получив предостережение благодаря этим методам? И не повлияет ли это на нашу судьбу?

Ответ: Судьбу, которую мы сами создаем под действием закона Причинности своими собственными действиями, можно разделить на три вида. Во-первых, есть судьба, которую по самой природе обстоятельств мы не можем искупить в настоящей жизни; например, когда человек совершает убийство. Понесет он наказание здесь или нет, не имеет значения, ведь тюремная жизнь обычно никого не делает более мягким и добрым. Иногда получается наоборот: она ожесточает человека и восстанавливает его против всех. Чтобы исполнился закон природы, он должен узнать, что ближнего нельзя лишать его формы; он должен научиться служить. Долг не будет погашен, пока у него в будущем не окажется возможности оказать существенную помощь своей прежней жертве.

Второй вид судьбы мы пожинаем день ото дня; можно сказать, что, как при сделке за наличные, мы платим и освобождаемся. Если мы объелись — у нас несварение; если мы выходим на улицу плохо одетыми — мы простужаемся и так далее.

Третий вид называется зрелой, или сложившейся, судьбой. Это итог наших действий в предыдущих жизнях или в наши ранние годы, который складывается в результат и воплощается в изображения, показываемые духу как панорама грядущей жизни, когда он начинает двигаться к возрождению. Как только дух выбирает определенную жизнь со зрелой судьбой, предназначенной для уплаты долга Ангелами-регистраторами, он связывает себя своим выбором. Стремление к тому, чтобы приспосабливаться к сложившейся судьбе, присуще телу и предначертано звездами, так как влияния звезд являются источником активности человека. Поэтому данную сложившуюся судьбу можно увидеть по гороскопу рождения совершенно отчетливо. Она очевидна и явна для духовно настроенного астролога или хироманта. Эти специалисты могут также увидеть другие виды судьбы и иногда принимают по ошибке один вид за другой. Отсюда ошибочные предсказания по поводу возможности избежать того или иного события. Если эта судьба зрелая, ее невозможно избежать, несмотря на все предупреждения, подтверждением чему, возможно, может послужить следующий пример:

В 1906 году автор давал уроки астрологии господину Л., хорошо известному лектору в Лос-Анджелесе, используя личный гороскоп этого господина для обучения, так как такое использование гороскопа позволяет ученику проверить истинность интерпретации символов в отношении прошлого и делает предмет изучения более интересным, чем при использовании чужого гороскопа. Оказалось, что в гороскопе г-на Л. было прописано несколько несчастных случаев; были рассчитаны дни, когда они могли произойти. Ближайший инцидент должен был произойти во время новолуния, 21 июля 1906 года. Поэтому г-н Л. был предупрежден о том, что ему надо оставаться дома в этот день и на седьмой день после него, причем последняя дата расценивалась как более опасная. Его предупредили, что есть опасность травм нижней части головы, шеи, груди и рук в результате короткой поездки на велосипеде, экипаже или электромобиле.

Эти сведения произвели сильное впечатление на г-на Л., и он обещал оставаться дома в указанные дни. Автор уехал на север и оттуда написал г-ну Л., напомнив об опасности как раз перед тем, как мог произойти несчастный случай. Он получил письмо с заверениями, что г-н Л. будет осторожен.

Следующее сообщение по этому поводу пришло от общего друга. Г-н Л. поехал в Сьерра-Мадре читать лекцию двадцать восьмого июля и получил предсказанные травмы при столкновении с локомотивом. Автор был очень удивлен, что его указаниями так пренебрегли. Ответ пришел спустя три месяца, когда г-н Л. поблагодарил его за информацию, которая, по его словам, оказалась для него очень ценной, доказав истинность астрологии. Причина несчастного случая была в том, что он забыл дату. Он написал: «Я думал, что было 29-е число».

Этот случай, по мнению автора, показывает, что на сложившуюся судьбу нельзя повлиять и что мы спокойно можем делать то, что можем, чтобы избежать надвигающейся опасности, не беспокоясь, что мы столкнемся с законом Причинности. Вокруг нас присутствуют невидимые помощники, которые противодействуют любой нашей попытке повлиять на события и, по мнению автора, они ответственны за то, что г-н Л. перепутал даты.

### <h3 id="question-154">Вопрос 154</h3>

Плохо ли использовать хиромантию, астрологию или френологию как способ заработать на жизнь?

Ответ: Что плохо и что хорошо, зависит от позиции человека. Еще пятьдесят лет назад считалось правильным убить упрямого негра. Его хозяин мог совершить подобное убийство безнаказанно, как сейчас он может убить собаку или лошадь. Сегодня мы будем считать такой поступок убийством. Некоторые люди сейчас смотрят на астрологию просто как на метод расчета, а на хиромантию и френологию — как на материалистические науки, не имеющие никакого духовного значения. Тот, кто рассматривает эти науки подобным образом, не будет повинен, если он использует их как способ обеспечить существование. Но тот, кто достиг понимания духовной стороны этих наук, будет, по мнению автора, поступать беспринципно, продавая знания за деньги. Кроме того, тот, кто так принижает эти духовные науки, никогда не сможет дать наилучший совет своим клиентам, поскольку блеск золота будет всегда скрывать правильное решение. Таков опыт автора и многих других людей, придерживающихся этих же взглядов. В любом случае спрашивающий поступил бы неправильно, если бы стал зарабатывать на жизнь, используя свои познания в этих науках, так как его вопрос показывает, что у него есть опасения на этот счет; и к тому же он будет осуждать сам себя, если будет так низко использовать свой талант.

Существует гораздо более ценная награда, чем золото. Если мы используем наши знания для целительства и помощи, у нас никогда не будет недостатка в средствах к существованию и мы будем собирать «сокровища на небе, где ни моль, ни ржа не истребляют». У нас будут большие и лучшие возможности для служения, если мы посвятим свои таланты бескорыстному служению.

### <h3 id="question-155">Вопрос 155</h3>

Населены ли Марс, Юпитер и другие планеты; если да, то превосходят ли их обитатели своим развитием людей на Земле; перевоплощаются ли души с Земли на другие планеты и наоборот?

Ответ: Все планеты Солнечной системы населены и являются полем эволюции для различных классов духов на разных стадиях развития. Наиболее близкие к Солнцу планеты обеспечивают жизнь наиболее развитым существам. Юпитер представляет исключение из этого правила; он населен человечеством, стоящим несколько выше, чем человечество Земли.

Принцип таков: наивысшие вибрации существуют в Центральном Солнце, которое когда-то содержало все существа, обитающие сейчас на планетах. Но не все могли выдержать огромные вибрации этого центрального огненного тумана. Поэтому на полюсах произошла кристаллизация; постепенно закристаллизовавшееся вещество притянулось к экватору и было выброшено с обитавшими на нем духами. Этот первый выброс стал Ураном. Позднее другие классы духов закристаллизовали часть Солнца и были выброшены, чтобы двигаться по орбитам на разных расстояниях от центрального источника в соответствии со скоростью вибрации, необходимой для развития на них духов, образуя в конечном счете ту Солнечную систему, которая нам сейчас известна.

Каждый класс духов остается в своем окружении под прямой опекой и руководством одного из Планетарных Духов, чьим телом является планета, где они обитают.

Духи воплощаются на разных планетах потому, что они находятся на сильно различающихся стадиях духовного развития. Так что они обычно не воплощаются на других планетах кроме тех случаев, когда время от времени кого-то с внутренних планет посылают на внешние в качестве учителей. По крайней мере так происходило, когда нашему человечеству были нужны учителя воплощенные и видимые. Тогда некоторые существа с Венеры и Меркурия были доставлены на Землю, чтобы направлять зарождающееся человечество. Они были известны как посланники Богов, и первыми царями и правителями человеческой расы стали Владыки Венеры. Позже человеческие существа, опередившие других в своем развитии, были переданы под руководство Владык Меркурия, которые посвятили их в тайны. Эти люди, в свою очередь, стали правителями над своими собратьями. Они тогда были истинными царями по благодати Божией, правя людьми для их духовного подъема и блага безотносительно к собственной власти и своему возвеличиванию.

### <h3 id="question-156">Вопрос 156</h3>

Правда ли, что небулярная теория существования вселенной в гораздо большей степени научна, чем библейские рассказы о сотворении мира?

Ответ: Небулярная теория была отвергнута Гербертом Спенсером, поскольку, как и Библия, она постулирует первопричину.

При кратком рассмотрении теория заключается в следующем: однажды в пространстве самопроизвольно появилась огненная туманность. Внутри этого огненного тумана появились течения, также самопроизвольно, и под воздействием этих течений огненная туманность приняла сферическую форму, вращаясь с огромной скоростью. Центробежная сила послужила причиной выброса кольца, которое распалось, потом его части соединились и образовали планету, вращающуюся по орбите вокруг центральной массы. Так одна за другой появились различные планеты. Они постепенно остывали, и в конце концов Солнечная система была создана. По крайней мере на одной из этих планет самопроизвольно появилась жизнь в форме протоплазмы, которая постепенно развивалась, проходя стадии иглокожих, моллюсков, членистоногих и позвоночных, кульминируя в итоге на стадии человека, который является наивысшим разумом в обозримой вселенной.

Так с важной миной говорит ученый, добавляя: «Видите, как это просто и разумно? А если не видите, давайте я покажу вам на примере». Он может взять сосуд с водой и налить на поверхность немного масла. Вода представляет пространство, а масло — огненную туманность. Затем он может взять иголку и начать перемешивать масло, имитируя образованные в огненной туманности течения, и под действием этого перемешивания масло примет сферическую форму. Постепенно сфера будет деформироваться по экватору и выпустит кольцо, которое примет форму планеты и будет вращаться вокруг своей оси. И ученый победно скажет: «Вот, вы видите, как это естественно, нет ни малейшей необходимости в вашем Боге!».

Удивительно, что люди, обладающие умом, способным придумать такую великолепную демонстрацию, могут в то же время быть столь тупыми, чтобы не видеть, что они сами выступают в роли Бога, который задумал и воплотил в жизнь вселенную так же, как ученые придумали свою демонстрацию и осуществили ее. Бог своим могуществом оберегает нашу вселенную и движет планеты, как ученый движет свои планеты из масла, и, если бы Бог прекратил свою деятельность на мгновение, мироздание тут же превратилось бы в хаотическую смесь, как масляное солнце и планеты прекращают свое существование в тот момент, когда ученый останавливает процесс.

Поэтому, опровергая, с одной стороны, утверждение Библии о том, что Бог создает вселенную и движет ею, небулярная теория, с другой стороны, демонстрирует необходимость божественного вмешательства. И при правильном понимании очевидно, что нет существенной разницы между научным и религиозным представлением.

### <h3 id="question-157">Вопрос 157</h3>

Что такое кометы?

Ответ: Размышляя над мудростью великих Творческих Иерархий в сравнении с нашей, мы, естественно, будем склонны думать, что эта мудрость не допускает ошибок. Но после некоторого размышления оказывается, что, поскольку эти Иерархии также развиваются, хотя и проходят уроки, намного превосходящие наши, они могут время от времени совершать ошибки. Они действуют в макрокосмосе, большом мире, теле Бога, тогда как мы действуем в микрокосмосе, малом мире, состоящем из наших различных проводников. Как мы допускаем ошибки в своих действиях, проходя необходимые нам уроки, так и великие Творческие Иерархии иногда терпят неудачу, выполняя свою работу.

Мы знаем, что при вынашивании ребенка возможен выкидыш. Эмбрион при этом выбрасывается из системы и сразу начинает разрушаться. Существует такой же риск, когда создается мир, а именно когда он кристаллизуется или формируется прежде, чем он завершит период созревания в мире Желаний. Если он не был должным образом сформирован и подобно гипсу, который приготовил скульптор, чтобы вылепить прекрасную статую, затвердел, прежде чем получил форму, то появляется бесформенная, бесполезная масса. Если подобное происходит при образовании мира, получается то, что нам известно как комета, а эллиптическая орбита, по которой она движется, — это линия потока в мире Желаний. Проявление Эго, пока оно еще не попало в лоно матери, подобно комете. В этот период оно имеет колоколообразную форму с ядром наверху и с большим количеством материала, струящимся позади него и похожим на хвост кометы. И это колоколообразное воплощающееся Эго очерчивает эллиптические орбиты вокруг Земли, пока не настанет момент войти в лоно будущей матери.

### <h3 id="question-158">Вопрос 158</h3>

Создает ли движение планеты шум в космосе?

Ответ: Пифагор говорил о гармонии сфер, и он не использовал это выражение просто как поэтический образ. Такая гармония существует. Иоанн пишет, что «в начале было Слово.... Все чрез Него начало быть, и без Него ничто не начало быть, что начало быть». Это было созидательное «да будет», которое впервые дало миру существование. Знакомый эксперимент, когда, помещая на стеклянную пластину песок, проводят по краю пластины скрипичным смычком и при этом образуются геометрические фигуры, иллюстрирует созидательную способность звука. Мы слышали о небесной музыке, так как с точки зрения Небесного мира все сначала создается в звуке, который образует из непрерывного вещества многочисленные формы, которые мы видим вокруг себя.

В сфере эзотерического видения вся Солнечная система — это один огромный музыкальный инструмент, о котором говорится в греческой мифологии как о семиструнной лире Аполлона, сияющего Солнечного Бога. Как в хроматической гамме двенадцать полутонов, так и на небе — двенадцать знаков зодиака, и так же, как у нас семь белых клавиш или целых тонов на клавиатуре пианино, существует семь планет. Можно сказать, что знаки зодиака — это дека космической арфы, а семь планет — струны. Планеты издают разные звуки, проходя через разные знаки; и поэтому по-разному влияют на человечество. Если бы гармония нарушилась хотя на мгновение, если бы в небесном оркестре возник хотя бы малейший разлад, вся вселенная разрушилась бы. Музыка может и разрушать, и строить. Этот факт был доказан великими музыкантами. Например, внук великого Феликса Мендельсона на протяжении нескольких лет экспериментировал с силой звука. Он пришел к заключению, что, если мы нашли ключевую ноту здания, моста или другого сооружения, мы можем сравнять с землей это сооружение, если будем издавать эту ноту достаточно громко и долго. Вот подходящий пример, который встретился автору.

«Несколько лет назад группа музыкантов репетировала около древних руин у города Гейдельберга, в Германии. В какой-то момент во время своих упражнений они взяли очень высокую и долгую ноту, и, когда они издали эту ноту, тяжелая стена из числа расположенных поблизости руин рухнула на землю с жутким грохотом. Они взяли ключевую ноту этой стены, и она упала». В свете данных фактов наши высокомерные улыбки прошлых дней, когда мы слушали рассказ об Иисусе Навине и стенах Иерихона, теперь исчезают. Бараний рог безусловно издал ключевую ноту этих стен, чувствительность которых повысилась из-за ритмичного топота его армии при подготовке к этому завершающему наивысшему моменту. Ритмичный топот множества ног разрушит любой мост, и поэтому солдатам приказывают идти не в ногу, когда они переходят мост. Итак, мы может ответить на вопрос, что каждая планета издает определенную ключевую ноту, которая является общей суммой всех шумов на ней, смешанных и гармонизированных населяющим ее Планетарным Духом. Этот звук можно услышать с помощью духовного слуха. Как сказал Гете:

    В пространстве, хором сфер объятом,  
    Свой голос солнце подает,  
    Свершая с громовым раскатом  
    Предписанный круговорот.  

Этот отрывок взят из первой части «Фауста», из пролога на небесах. И так же во второй части «Фауста» духи воздуха приветствуют восходящее Солнце словами:
  
    Только духам слышать впору,  
    Как гремят ворот затворы  
    Пред новорожденным днем.  
    Феба четверня рванула,  
    Свет приносит столько гула!  
  
### <h3 id="question-159">Вопрос 159</h3>

В чем эзотерическое значение использования двенадцати имен сыновей Иакова в связи с двенадцатью знаками зодиака, и используются ли они в связи с зодиаком Земли или зодиаком Солнца или с ними обоими?

Ответ: Существует только один зодиак, двенадцать созвездий, которые мы именуем: Лев, Телец и так далее. Это звезды, расположенные в узком поясе примерно по восемь градусов с каждой стороны эклиптики, или солнечного пути, как можно видеть с Земли. Двенадцать сыновей и одна дочь Иакова отождествляются с двенадцатью созвездиями, так как Иосиф отмечает, что израильтяне, странствуя по пустыне, носили с собой символические изображения этих двенадцати групп звезд на своих знаменах. В 49-й главе Книги Бытия и 33-й главе Второзакония его двенадцати сыновьям даются такие благословения, что тому, кто знает астрономию, невозможно не увидеть сходства между описанием этих сыновей и двенадцатью знаками зодиака.

Также, если мы обратим внимание на то, как был раскинут лагерь израильтян, располагавшихся двенадцатью коленами вокруг шатра, где находился семисвечник, то опять видна связь с астрономическим расположением двенадцати знаков зодиака вокруг семи планет, небесных светил Солнечной системы, Дома Бога.

Духовную причину сходства между Иаковом, его женами, его детьми и вселенной можно найти в герметической аксиоме, гласящей: «Как вверху, так и внизу». Иаков со своими четырьмя женами символизирует Солнце и четыре фазы Луны, которые являются подателями жизни всему, что живет на Земле. Двенадцать сыновей и одна дочь символизируют Творческие Иерархии, которые были активны во время эволюции нашей Солнечной системы и привели не только человечество, но и все другие царства к их нынешней ступени эволюционного достижения и сейчас работают с ними, чтобы еще дальше развить их в духовные существа. Именно они создали человека таким, каков он сейчас есть. Даже в наши дни человечество несет на себе отпечаток свойств двенадцати звездных знаков. Поэтому прасемиты, которые должны были стать прародителями новой расы, были разделены их вождем на двенадцать колен, каждое из которых представляло одно из созвездий.

### <h3 id="question-160">Вопрос 160</h3>

В чем разница между гелиоцентрической и геоцентрической системами в астрологии? Геоцентрическая астрология имеет отношение только к проблемам Земли, материальной жизни, а гелиоцентрическая — к проблемам души и духовной стороны жизни? Так как Солнце — духовная планета и управитель нашей Солнечной системы, оно ведет нас к финалу, поскольку мы используем солнечный зодиак в гелиоцентрической астрологии и земной зодиак — в геоцентрической. Можно ли вообще делать предсказания в этой жизни по солнечному зодиаку, или он относится только к духовной стороне человеческой природы?

Ответ: Одно из возражений против древней астрологии заключается в том, что она рассматривает Землю в качестве центра Солнечной системы так же, как и древние, и что после того как Коперник доказал, что планеты вращаются вокруг Солнца, многие считают астрологию «отжившей наукой», что является явным заблуждением. Дабы преодолеть эти возражения, некоторые астрологи в наше время изобрели систему, называемую «гелиоцентрической астрологией», которая полагает Солнце центром нашей Солнечной системы, а планеты — вращающимися вокруг него.

Абсолютно верно, говоря научно, что геоцентрическая система астрологии, представляющая Землю центром Солнечной системы, ошибочна. И мы неправильно говорим, что Солнце находится в знаке Рака, тогда как, двигаясь по своей орбите, Земля приходит в знак Козерога, и поэтому нам кажется отсюда, с Земли, будто Солнце находится в знаке Рака. Но не это является основной проблемой; в действительности не важно, какое из двух тел движется, астролог делает выводы на основании положения планет относительно Земли. Гораздо удобнее считать, что планеты вращаются вокруг Земли, как центра, чем использовать противоположную систему, так как в геоцентрической системе мы отмечаем взаимоотношения планет, которые видны с Земли, и их воздействия на разных людей тогда, когда эти влияния ощущались. И таким образом, на основании опыта мы приходим к нашей теперешней системе оценок, которая поэтому справедлива сейчас, как и была всегда. «Не изведаешь, пока не отведаешь», — говорится в известной поговорке. Подтверждение истинности астрологии — в правильности ее предсказаний, и всякий, кто добросовестно изучил эту науку и испробовал ее на себе, не может не подтвердить, что она истинна.

Иногда предсказания не сбываются, потому что астролог дает неправильную интерпретацию, но тем не менее, даже допуская возможность ошибок со стороны астрологов, осуществившихся предсказаний так много, что они превышают предел, объясняемый совпадениями.

Геоцентрическая система верна и вмещает в себя все стороны человеческой природы, не только физические проявления, но и духовную сторону. С другой стороны, гелиоцентрическая система была выдумана теми, кто хотел соответствовать науке и совсем не заботился о духовной стороне природы, поэтому в этом отношении она намного слабее. Кроме того, те, кто использовал геоцентрическую астрологию на протяжении веков, записывали свои наблюдения планетных влияний с данной точки зрения. С позиции же гелиоцентрической системы подобных знаний, опирающихся на опыт, очень мало, так что мы советуем спрашивающему не слишком беспокоиться по поводу гелиоцентрической системы.

### <h3 id="question-161">Вопрос 161</h3>

Возможно ли, чтобы Сатурн оказывал хорошее влияние? Спрашивающий был под влиянием Сатурна всю свою жизнь. Болезни, бедность, потеря наследства и несчастные случаи — все это достаточно неприятно. Может ли Сатурн вызывать также сложности в духовной сфере? Может ли он ограничивать наше развитие, когда наш дух сражается за благое дело? И освобождаемся ли мы от его влияния после смерти?

Ответ: Астрологи-материалисты считают Уран, Сатурн и Марс неблагоприятными планетами, а Венеру и Юпитер называют благоприятными. В царстве Бога нет ничего неблагоприятного. То, что нам кажется таковым, является добром-в-становлении. Также не нужно воображать, что влияния какой-либо планеты направлены на то, чтобы изводить людей. Мы пришли в этот мир, чтобы получить определенный опыт, необходимый для нашего духовного развития, и, если мы попытаемся понять влияние звезд, мы обнаружим, что это мощные факторы, которые помогают нам приобрести именно этот опыт. Сатурн является усмирителем. Когда мы сворачиваем с праведного пути преднамеренно или неосознанно, нам не позволяют оставаться в грехе, так как Сатурн приходит, чтобы остановить нас. Возможно, мы получили наследство; мы неправильно использовали его и сорили деньгами во все стороны. Поступая так, мы обычно злоупотребляем также и своим телом. Тогда приходит аспект Сатурна, влекущий за собой болезнь, и вот мы слегли. Мы вынуждены следовать диете и дать нашему организму отдых, и в результате мы поднимаемся с постели другим мужчиной или другой женщиной. Но вопрос заключается в том, выучили ли мы свой урок или нет. Во время нашего отдыха на ложе больного у нас было время подумать о том, какую жизнь мы ведем. Проанализировали ли мы свою жизнь, чтобы понять причины, подорвавшие наше здоровье? Если да, то мы извлекли пользу. Так как тогда мы будем знать, как поступать лучше и избегать ловушек, которые в будущем могут привести к болезни. Или, если все наше наследство пущено на ветер, мы стоим на улице с пустыми карманами. Возможно, нам некуда обратиться за помощью, и тогда мы вынуждены думать и сами прокладывать себе дорогу. Наши таланты были бесполезны, пока мы тратили деньги. В бедности же мы обращаем их себе на пользу, мы вынуждены использовать их, внося свой вклад в мировую работу. Мы теряем наше наследство, но мир приобретает труженика, и, если мы таким образом сможем выучить свой урок, тогда влияние Сатурна станет замаскированным благословением.

И так по отношению ко всему остальному в гороскопе, что может показаться неблагоприятным. Кроме того, чем более духовными мы становимся, тем менее неприятно на нас влияют так называемые неблагоприятные планеты или неблагоприятные аспекты. Они преобразуются во благо. Сатурн принесет духовному человеку не беду, а выносливость; не болезнь, а силу; и, так согласуясь с законами природы, живя в гармонии со звездами, мы управляем своей жизнью и изменяем ее по своему желанию.

Большая часть человечества плывет по течению и действует в соответствии со склонностями, внушаемыми влиянием звезд. Поэтому астролог может с удивительной точностью предсказать, что такие люди будут делать. Но чем более духовную жизнь ведет мужчина или женщина, тем в большей степени сам этот человек становится фактором, который необходимо учитывать при рассмотрении, и предсказания астролога не сбудутся ровно в той степени, в которой этот человек сам участвует в своих достижениях.

Звезды — это наши помощники в эволюции. Они не мертвые тела, состоящие из вещества, а живые, бьющиеся и вибрирующие тела великих духовных Разумных Существ, называемых в христианстве Семью Духами перед Престолом.

По мере того как меняемся мы, изменяется их влияние на нас, но мы не можем избежать их влияния просто в результате смерти. Когда для нас загорается заря новой жизни, мы появляемся с новым гороскопом, и, если мы устремляемся к духовному росту, постижению уроков, которые наметили для нашего обучения в прежней жизни звездные Ангелы, мы получим новые аспекты и новые расположения планет, которые будут и дальше помогать нашему продвижению по пути эволюции. С другой стороны, если мы в предыдущей жизни «били по иголкам, так что самому было больно», окажется, что гайки закручены немного сильнее и мы попадаем под еще более сильное давление, так чтобы в конце концов мы выучили свои уроки. И чем быстрее мы с этим справимся, тем лучше для нас.

### <h3 id="question-162">Вопрос 162</h3>

Как можно молиться или обращаться к Сатурну, когда он в качестве управляющей планеты вызывает наши несчастья и страдания?

Ответ: Чтобы понять, что такое молитва, давайте рассмотрим пример электростанции с проводами, идущими в городские дома. В каждом доме есть выключатель, когда мы его поворачиваем, энергия, которая до этого была вне проводов на электростанции, поступает в наши жилища, освещает их или приводит в движение механизмы в соответствии с законами своего проявления. Можно сказать, что Бог в первую очередь и Семь Планетарных Духов во вторую аналогичны электростанции, которая через провода соединена с каждым из нас, а молитва является рубильником, включая который мы соприкасаемся с божественным светом и жизнью, давая им возможность втекать в нас и освещать нас для нашего духовного восхождения.

Существует закон, по которому электричество без задержки потечет по меди или другим металлам, но будет остановлено стеклом, и, прежде чем мы сможем получить электричество в свои дома, мы должны обзавестись рубильником, сделанным в соответствии с законом, то есть медным рубильником. Если бы мы использовали стеклянный рубильник, мы бы не получили электричества; стеклянный рубильник был бы наиболее эффективным средством в качестве преграды поступлению электрического тока в наши жилища. Точно так же, если наши молитвы (которые аналогичны рубильнику) соответствуют законам Бога, божественная цель может через нас замкнуться и на наши молитвы ответят. Но если мы молимся против воли Бога, естественно, такие молитвы будут действовать так же, как стеклянный рубильник в электрической схеме.

Подобно тому, как великие нации посылают своих послов и полномочных представителей к другим нациям, так же на нашей Земле есть послы каждого великого звездного Ангела.

Их имена следующие:  
Итуриэль — посланник Урана.  
Кэсиэль — посланник Сатурна.  
Захариэль — посланник Юпитера.  
Самаэль — посланник Марса.  
Анаэль — посланник Венеры.  
Рафаэль — посланник Меркурия.  
Михаэль — посланник Солнца.  
Габриэль — посланник Луны.  

Луна — наш спутник, и она находится в ином положении, чем другие планеты. Посланники других планет — Архангелы, а Габриэль — Ангел.

Обычно человечество молится Богу. Эти молитвы в настоящее время главным образом эгоистичны и невежественны. Молитвы таких людей не могут привлечь внимание посланников, которые несут ответственность за различные области жизни, но им уделяют внимание, насколько это возможно, невидимые помощники, которые трудятся для духовного восхождения своих братьев. Тем не менее эзотерический астролог, который знает, чего он хочет, и который способен работать в гармонии со звездными силами, обращается непосредственно к посланникам звездных Ангелов и таким путем с большей легкостью добивается желаемого. Он изучает планетарные часы, в течение которых управляют данные звезды, и в это время обращается с просьбой, обычно для кого-нибудь другого или для духовного озарения в решении определенных вопросов, направленных на достижение всеобщего блага.

### <h3 id="question-163">Вопрос 163</h3>

Почему животные, стоящие на более низкой ступени эволюции, обладают инстинктом, который, казалось бы, заслуживает гораздо большего доверия, чем здравый смысл человеческих существ?

Ответ: Ответ на этот вопрос имеет отношение к схождению Эго в материю, но, во-первых, мы должны провести четкое различие между отдельными духами животных и Групповым Духом, являющимся их водителем. Отдельные духи животных все еще не обладают самосознанием, поэтому они действуют, несомненно, в соответствии с указаниями Группового Духа. Последний является сущностью, принадлежащей другой эволюции, и он действует в Невидимых мирах, где все гораздо более очевидно, чем здесь. Отсюда следует, что то, что мы называем инстинктом, на самом деле является указаниями Группового Духа в Невидимом мире, который управляет животными.

Человеческие духи, с другой стороны, сошли непосредственно в Физический мир и, следовательно, до некоторой степени ослеплены более плотной материей этого плана существования. Пример поможет прояснить причины того, что, хотя дух является чрезвычайно мудрым в высших мирах, увеличение плотности материи, которого он достиг в результате своего схождения, неизбежно скрывает эту мудрость.

Рука — это наиболее ценный инструмент человека. Возможности руки, наверное, ни у кого так не очевидны, как у музыканта. Искусный музыкант может извлечь из своего любимого инструмента волнующую душу мелодию нежными касаниями хорошо натренированных и чутких пальцев, но, как только он надевает перчатки, тут же чувствительное касание пропадает. Если он на первую пару наденет вторую из более толстого и грубого материала, он, пожалуй, не сможет исполнить даже мелодию, а если поверх перчаток он наденет варежки, то совсем не сможет играть или будет издавать режущие ухо звуки. Перчатки на руке музыканта можно сопоставить с различными проводниками, в которые облекается дух во время схождения в материю. Варежки соответствуют физическому телу.

Любой, кто будет наблюдать попытки музыканта сыграть в варежках, не слышав его игры до того, как он надел перчатки, может подумать, что он не способен играть, но такое заключение было бы неверным. Эго человека находится в схожем положении, его духовные силы были скрыты проводниками, в которые оно сейчас заключено. Но придет время, когда оно научится в совершенстве управлять этими проводниками, и тогда его духовная сила засияет таким блеском, который невозможно сейчас даже представить.

### <h3 id="question-164">Вопрос 164</h3>

Не могли бы вы немного пролить свет на то, каким должно быть наше отношение к низшим формам жизни?

Имеем ли мы право убивать кого-либо безнаказанно, если любые живые существа в некотором роде наши братья?

Как быть с ядовитыми насекомыми и рептилиями?

Ответ: Во вселенной существует только одна жизнь — жизнь Бога. «Им мы живем и движемся и существуем». И не только мы, но и все другие жизни являются проявлениями Бога. В свое время мы должны стать творцами, так как Он — Творец. Но пока мы грубо разрушаем формы других существ, мы мешаем себе. Спрашивающий прав, утверждая, что низшие животные — наши братья, но, к сожалению, вместо того чтобы о них заботиться и вдохновлять их верой и любовью, мы ухитрились внушить страх каждому животному на Земле, безжалостно их уничтожая, и кажется, что в качестве воздаяния, мы сами должны пребывать в постоянном страхе перед микроскопической жизнью в форме бацилл, которых нельзя убить ножом или застрелить из ружья.

Что касается вредных насекомых и рептилий, во многих случаях можно сказать, что они являются воплощением наших собственных злых мыслей и порождаются нашими отвратительными привычками. Наука показала, как можно при надлежащих санитарных условиях избавиться от них, по крайней мере в очень значительной степени, без необходимости их убивать. Большие по размеру рептилии, такие, как змеи, не так уж опасны, как часто думают. В храмах Индии, где определенные касты людей культивировали полное непричинение вреда, отказываясь убивать даже самое маленькое существо, можно видеть, как ежедневно ядовитые змеи ползают среди собирающихся там людей, никогда не причиняя им ни малейшего вреда. И если мы тоже будем культивировать непричинение вреда меньшим созданиям, они быстро научатся нам доверять, как сейчас они выучились нас бояться. Записаны рассказы о моряках, которые высаживались на пустынных островах, куда не ступала нога человека, и обнаруживали, что птицы там были полностью лишены страха, пока несколько из них не было убито вторгшимися негодяями. Только тогда птицы стали улетать при приближении человека.

Мы также сделали из некоторых людей хищных животных, которых мы называем грабителями и разбойниками, подстерегающих своего ближнего и отнимающих у него его добро, при этом часто нанося телесные повреждения и даже совершая убийства. И все это — результат нашего жестокого обращения, продиктованного страхом. Если бы у нас была любовь, у нас не было бы страха, ибо «совершенная любовь изгоняет всякий страх». Если у нас нет страха, ничто не может причинить нам вред, так как бесстрашие и доверие являются лучшей защитой, чем пистолет и замок. Поэтому нам надо развивать отношение любви ко всему, что живет и дышит; нам надо прекратить убивать миллионы низших животных для своей еды и ради спортивных утех, ужасных по своей жестокости. Любовь по отношению к нашим ближним вызовет у них схожие эмоции, и изготовители замков и оружейники вскоре останутся без работы. Мы жалуемся на большие налоги, необходимые для содержания сильной полиции, института судов, огромных тюрем и исправительных домов, но все эти институты исчезнут как по волшебству, если мы заменим страх любовью. Библия рисует картины того времени, когда лев и буйвол, маленький ребенок и ядовитая рептилия будут мирно играть вместе. Подобное несомненно осуществится, так как хищники не всегда были плотоядными. В далеком прошлом человек внес свой вклад в их развитие, и в будущем именно его задачей будет изменение этих условий.

### <h3 id="question-165">Вопрос 165</h3>

Правда ли, что ядовитые и вредные рептилии созданы порочными мыслями людей, насколько это касается формы? И поэтому не является ли проявлением любви то, что мы убиваем их и таким образом освобождаем божественную искру, спрятанную внутри, чтобы она могла обрести более высокую форму?

Ответ: Ни одно из тех животных, которых мы видим вокруг себя, не было создано человеком. Все эти формы, от самых высших до самых низших, являются эманациями Групповых Духов — духовных сущностей, принадлежащих другой эволюции, не той, которой принадлежит человеческое царство. Но человек творит своими мыслями, поэтому мысли страха и ненависти действительно обретают форму и по прошествии веков кристаллизуются в то, что нам известно как бациллы. Бациллы инфекционных болезней являются воплощениями страха и ненависти, и поэтому они побеждаются противоположной силой — храбростью. Камертон начинает звучать, если ударить по другому камертону того же тона, так и микроорганизмы. Если мы окажемся в присутствии человека, зараженного инфекционной болезнью, испытывая страх, трепет, очень вероятно, что мы притянем к себе смертельно ядовитые микробы. Но если, с другой стороны, мы подойдем к этому человеку, сохраняя полное бесстрашие, мы сможем избежать инфекции, особенно если нами движет любовь. Но любовь не побуждает нас убивать в обычном смысле слова. Это правда, что, если бы мы могли непосредственно взаимодействовать с жизнью вредных и ядовитых существ и помочь им подняться до более высоких форм, мы возможно, совершили бы добро; но мы даже не способны оценить, когда данная существующая форма исчерпает свою полезность. Поэтому мы не можем осмелиться взять на себя ответственность лишать насыщающую жизнь ее инструмента из добрых побуждений. В единственном случае мы можем иногда должным образом лишить жизни животное из любви к нему — в случае, когда животное искалечено и у него нет шансов выздороветь, мы лишаем его жизни, чтобы положить конец его страданиям.

### <h3 id="question-166">Вопрос 166</h3>

Что такое Групповой Дух, где он находится, и как он выглядит?

Ответ: Как человек имеет тело, состоящее из множества клеток, каждая из которых обладает индивидуальным сознанием, так же и сущность Группового Духа, действующая в Духовном мире, обладает духовным телом, состоящим из множества отдельных духов животных. Сам Групповой Дух не может действовать в Физическом мире, но он развивается, заключая различные духи животных в форму тела, которую он создает; потом эти духи формируют вид или семейство животных. Групповой Дух направляет все эти тела животных посредством указаний, которые мы называем инстинктом. Когда тело животного умирает, дух животного неосознанно извлекает определенный опыт из функционирования в этом проводнике. Спустя некоторое время он вновь поглощается духовным телом Группового Духа, где и остается на некоторое время, пока Групповой Дух усваивает опыт, собранный этим отдельным духом животного. Так, со временем Групповой Дух растет и развивается. Так же развиваются и духи животных, которые являются его подопечными. Они станут людьми в будущих воплощениях, и тогда Групповой Дух будет руководить ими как Расовый или Национальный Дух, пока они не будут полностью способны заботиться о себе лично. Групповые Духи животных находятся в мире Желаний и окружают поверхность Земли. Групповые Духи растений находятся в слое Конкретной Мысли, которая занимает центр Земли, и Групповые Духи минералов еще, по сути, не вошли в атмосферу нашей Земли. Они находятся в слое Абстрактной Мысли.

Групповые Духи животных очень часто можно видеть в мире Желаний с человеческими телами и головами животных. Изображения в египетских храмах представляют в грубой форме внешний вид этих Групповых Духов. Обученный исследователь без труда вступает с ними в контакт и очень часто имеет повод изумляться их эрудиции.

### <h3 id="question-167">Вопрос 167</h3>

Подчиняются ли животные закону Причинности?

Ответ: Нет, в смысле моральной ответственности не подчиняются. Конечно, если животное выпрыгивает из окна высокого здания, то это повлечет за собой повреждения в зависимости от силы удара при падении, точно так же, как когда человек выпрыгивает из окна. Но животное испытывает только физические последствия, проявляющиеся в травме, от которой оно страдает, тогда как человек, сознательно совершающий подобное действие, не только страдает от определенных повреждений, но несет и моральную ответственность за инструмент, которым он обладает. И закон Причинности повлечет за собой соответствующее моральное воздаяние такого характера, что он научится заботиться о своем инструменте и не будет больше пытаться разрушить его подобными действиями в будущем.

Причина того, что у животных нет моральной ответственности, заключается в отсутствии способности к рассуждению, они просто действуют по указанию Группового Духа, который мы называем инстинктом, и, может быть, инстинкт вселил в животное страх, который привел к совершению действия, закончившегося повреждением тела. Для того чтобы быть морально ответственным перед законом Причинности, нужно иметь свободу воли и выбора, а также способность к правильному рассуждению. Поэтому мы повторяем: так как животные лишены этих атрибутов, морально они совершенно не подчиняются закону Причинности.

### <h3 id="question-168">Вопрос 168</h3>

Живут ли животные после смерти?

Ответ: То, что живет после смерти, так это дух, у которого нет ни начала, ни конца, он есть. Но вы, скорее всего, имеете в виду то, остается ли он в форме животного. На этот вопрос можно ответить — да, дух остается в этой форме более или менее долго в соответствии со стадией своей эволюции в теле желаний, состоящем из материи мира Желаний. Ясновидящий может видеть, как жук, который полз по тротуару и на которого наступили, проползает еще некоторое расстояние и постепенно превращается в ничто. Он сохраняет свою форму всего на несколько мгновений, прежде чем дух возвратится в центральный источник Группового Духа. В отношении лошади, коровы или другого высшего животного можно сказать, что они остаются в мире Желаний дольше, чем низшие формы. В качестве иллюстрации можно привести случай, который привлек значительное внимание несколько лет назад, когда Райдер Хаггард, английский романист, опубликовал рассказ о замечательном сне. У него была собака, к которой он был сильно привязан, и однажды ночью ему приснился сон, что к нему пришла его собака, с трудом двигаясь и явно страдая, и потянула его за собой. Райдер Хаггард в своем сне последовал за собакой, которая привела его к удаленному на некоторое расстояние ручью. Там среди камышей она показала Райдеру Хаггарду свое мертвое тело, жалобно и недоуменно глядя на хозяина.

Когда на следующее утро Райдер Хаггард проснулся, он помнил сон очень живо, но не обратил не него внимания, пока позже этим же днем не было обнаружено, что собака пропала. После безуспешных поисков в окрестностях Райдер Хаггард в конце концов обратил внимание на местность, увиденную во сне. Там среди камышей он обнаружил тело своей собаки, лежавшее именно в той позе, которую он видел во сне. Конечно, объяснить происшедшее было невозможно, это был просто один из так называемых необъяснимых случаев. Но для эзотерика ясно, что разумная собака, встретив смерть и оказавшись в мире Желаний, ночью пришла к своему хозяину, который был также вне своего тела, и привела его на место происшествия, чтобы он успокоил ее и помог ей.

### <h3 id="question-169">Вопрос 169</h3>

Когда умирает домашняя собака или кошка, умирает ли в этот момент весь Групповой Дух, которому принадлежало животное? Далее, что происходит с душой животного и помогает ли ей на пути восхождения человеческая любовь и забота, которой оно было окружено?

Ответ: Вопрос показывает, что у спрашивающего нет должного представления о том, что такое Групповой Дух. Подобно тому, как наше тело образовано из многочисленных клеток, каждая из которых имеет свою маленькую клеточную жизнь, но все клетки подчиняются нашему центральному разуму, так и Групповой Дух вида животных является духовной сущностью, принадлежащей другой эволюции и обладающей духовным телом, образованным многими развивающимися духами животных. Время от времени он посылает этих духов животных в воплощение в тела животных своего вида, по одному духу в каждое тело. После смерти они возвращаются к Групповому Духу с более высоким уровнем сознания, чем тот, который был в момент рождения; это позволяет развиваться Групповому Духу. И, в свою очередь, он управляет духами отдельных животных в своем семействе. Как и все другие духи, Групповой Дух не может умереть. Он является водителем духов животных и по мере их развития духовное тело Группового Духа претерпевает изменения. Когда духи отдельных животных достаточно развиваются, они становятся индивидуализированными человеческими существами, но остаются на попечении того же Группового Духа; это можно видеть из того, что нации и расы находятся под управлением Расового Духа. Они не станут хозяевами себе, пока их развитие не выйдет за рамки семейных или национальных связей. Вот почему Христос сказал: «Кто любит отца или мать более, нежели Меня, не достоин Меня», так как отец и мать — это тела, они являются путами и помехами. У духов нет ни отца, ни матери, но они все едины в своей основе.

Относительно того, чем становится душа животного после смерти, можно сказать, что, после того как она покидает тело, она вскоре возвращается к Групповому Духу. Любовь и забота, которую мы дарили животному, естественно, сильно содействует его развитию. Тогда как дикие животные действуют, полностью подчиняясь приказам Группового Духа, называемого нами инстинктом, домашние животные демонстрируют способность мыслить, намного превосходя обычный уровень своей эволюции, достигнутый в настоящее время. Они получили эту способность от нас по тому же принципу, в соответствии с которым при помещении сильно наэлектризованной проволоки рядом с другой, незаряженной, проволокой, последняя зарядится электричеством более низкого напряжения. Точно так же животное, взаимодействующее с человеческим существом, само по себе не способно мыслить, но в некоторой степени обучается этому в процессе взаимодействия. И мы можем с уверенностью заключить, что домашние животные со временем станут учителями своих менее развитых собратьев.

### <h3 id="question-170">Вопрос 170</h3>

Какие вещества выделяет человек или животное, по которым их можно выследить; как, например, ищейки берут след преступника?

Ответ: Когда ясновидящий впервые смотрит на других людей эфирным зрением, он бывает поражен зрелищем потоков звезд, пирамид и других геометрических форм, испускаемых их руками и лицом, и страшно удивляется, что же это может быть. Позже он узнает, что это кристаллы, из которых образовано тело и которые выделяются кожей. Большинство выделений остается на одежде, что и обеспечивает ищеек отправной точкой в их поисках. По мере разложения эти мельчайшие частицы испускают зловоние, подобное тому, которое испускают все разлагающиеся тела. Мы сами ощущаем этот запах, если грязная одежда некоторое время остается не-постиранной. Собаки, обладая более острым обонянием, чем люди, различают запахи разных людей, и если мельчайшие частички оставленные человеком, прячущимся от правосудия, рассыпаны вдоль дорожки, по которой он шел, ищейка на протяжении непродолжительного времени после того, как беглец прошел, с легкостью отличает их от частичек других людей или животных.

### <h3 id="question-171">Вопрос 171</h3>

Что является началом жизни?

Ответ: Когда такой вопрос задают ученому, он начинает рассказывать нам о протоплазме, о протиле или о чем-нибудь подобном, но все это форма. Не важно сколь малой, незначительной и простой может быть эта форма, она остается формой. С точки зрения эзотерика вопрос задан неправильно, так как ДУХ ЕСТЬ, БЫЛ И БУДЕТ ВСЕГДА. Сэр Эдвин Арнольд написал в своей прекрасной поэме «Божественная песня»:

  Дух, не родившийся на свет,  
  Умереть никогда не сможет.  
  Без него нет мгновенья и вечности нет,  
  Конец и начало — лишь грезы.  
  Раз не рожден, то не умрет,  
  Неизменным пребудет без страха.  
  Смерть не прервет его быстрый полет,  
  Лишь обитель вернется к праху.  
    
  Дух, изношенное платье отстраняя от себя,  
  Говорит: «Возьму другое, но немного погодя».  
  Он в телесном одеянье, что в наследие дано,  
  С легкостью живет, покуда не износится оно.  
  
Именно жизнь строит формы и использует их какое-то время, чтобы таким образом продвинуться в своем развитии. Когда они становятся непригодными, жизнь идет дальше, покидая формы, и тогда они умирают. Таким образом, точнее было бы сформулировать вопрос так: «Как возникла смерть?». Так как жизнь ЕСТЬ — она не имеет ни начала, ни завершения.

### <h3 id="question-172">Вопрос 172</h3>

Что такое материя? Реальна ли она?

Ответ: Существуют различные теории материи. Если мы спросим материалиста, он, конечно, станет утверждать, что материя — это единственная реальность, что все является материей и ничто не может существовать иначе. Представитель «Христианской Науки» придерживается абсолютно противоположного мнения. Он считает, что материя не существует — это иллюзия, что все существующее является духом. Так, эти два класса людей являются полной противоположностью друг другу. Но истина — посередине.

Когда Бог хочет проявиться, Он выделяет внутри себя мыслеформы такой вселенной, которую Он хочет создать. Эти архетипические идеи суть дух, впервые выделенный из центрального источника. Но под воздействием времени и пространства эти идеи медленно кристаллизуются и становятся тем, что нам известно как материя. Похожий процесс жизнедеятельности мы можем наблюдать на примере улитки. Выделения ее мягкого и гибкого тела постепенно кристаллизуются в твердую и жесткую раковину, которая не может двигаться иначе, как за счет усилий улитки. Итак, если домик улитки — это закристаллизовавшаяся улитка, то материя — это закристаллизовавшийся дух. Как домик улитки остается неподвижным, если улитка его не перемещает, так и вещество недвижно, если его не движет дух. Но со временем домик улитки начинает разрушаться. Материя, из которой он был сделан, распадается на мельчайшие частицы и становится пригодной для постройки других пластичных форм — она опять может стать телом улитки. Так же и закристаллизовавшийся дух, то есть материя, возвращается в нематериальное состояние и опять становится самим собой. Материя развивается параллельно с духом, становясь все более утонченной, податливой и подверженной воздействию духа, когда он раз от раза образует различные формы.

Итак, вместе с «Христианской Наукой» можно сказать, что все является духом, что все, что кажется материей, на самом деле дух в закристаллизованном состоянии. И мы также можем согласиться с материалистом, что все является материей, так как дух, который еще не закристаллизовался в материю, несомненно, закристаллизуется. Ошибочно считать что-либо во вселенной Бога нереальным; как материя, так и дух реальны. Они являются положительным и отрицательным полюсами Бога.

### <h3 id="question-173">Вопрос 173</h3>

В одной из предыдущих лекций вы говорили, что Земля является телом Духа, который дает жизнь обитателям ее поверхности. Почему он дарует одним цветы и фрукты, а другим — землетрясения и голод?

Ответ: В перерыве между смертью и новым рождением развоплощенные духи, достигшие Второго неба, где находятся архетипы всего, строят свое будущее окружение, в котором они будут пожинать то, что посеяли. Если они были прилежными в предыдущих жизнях, если они возделывали землю и вырастили две травинки, где была только одна, они создадут для себя еще более плодородную землю, которая принесет больший урожай при меньшем труде. Если они проводили свою жизнь в мыслях о нирване, небесном месте покоя и праздности, и им больше нравилось вести дискуссии на метафизические темы, чем заботиться о материальных делах, они будут продолжать заниматься этим и на Втором небе и, как следствие, их земля будет безводной, когда они вернутся к земной жизни. Тогда они будут испытывать голод, переживать потопы и землетрясения для того, чтобы они поняли необходимость предусматривать материальные условия. Тогда в свое время они выучат свой урок и приложат усилия, чтобы покорить этот мир, как мы покорили его на Западе, так как спрашивающий, безусловно, имеет в виду жителей Востока, страдающих от потопов и голода. Они наши младшие братья, отставшие от нас в эволюции, и должны следовать по нашим стопам. Им надо научиться на время забывать о духовных мирах, чтобы достичь развития, которое им может дать только материальный мир. Итак, за голодом, который сейчас так широко распространен, стоит определенная цель, и столь же глубокая цель есть и у нашего процветания. Голод на Востоке неизбежно приведет его обитателей к более материальному взгляду на жизнь, но мы, имея землю, наполненную всеми благами мира, где удивительные изобретения сделали жизнь проще, когда-нибудь обязательно скажем себе, удовлетворившись материальными благами: «Что хорошего во всем этом? Лучше дайте нам духовные ценности», и тогда мы вступим на путь духовного развития гораздо более высокий, чем путь Востока.

### <h3 id="question-174">Вопрос 174</h3>

Что означает фраза: «Человек, познай себя»?

Ответ: Это изречение находилось над входом в греческий мистериальный храм как указание на то, что человек обязательно должен полностью постичь тайну собственной природы, которая обладает большей глубиной, чем может показаться, в соответствии с герметическим принципом: «Как вверху, так и внизу». Когда он поймет и познает себя, он сможет по аналогии познать и Бога. Так как действительно: «Сотворил Бог человека... по образу Божию».

Но чтобы познать себя, ему необходимо не только осмыслить то, что он видит, физическое тело, но и невидимые тела, являющиеся причиной его мыслей, чувств и эмоций. Именно такое учение преподносилось в мистериальных храмах.

Но существует другое и гораздо более глубокое значение этого изречения. Когда мы спрашиваем себя о причинах всех страданий и несчастий в мире, мы должны обратиться к более ранним эпохам существования Земли, чтобы получить ответ. Во время двух первых эпох, Полярной и Гиперборейской, человек был завершенной созидательной единицей, способной испускать из себя силы, порождавшие тело другого существа. Но в Лемурийскую эпоху, когда понадобилось создавать мозг и гортань, сексуальная сила была разделена и одна ее половина была использована для создания этого объекта. Только вторая половина по-прежнему была способна к произведению потомства. Тогда человек перестал осознавать себя, но «Адам познал свою жену», и в результате она родила ему детей.

Дух по сути своей чувствует свою божественную созидательную природу и тайно восстает против необходимости искать взаимодействия с другим духом для произведения потомства. В результате печаль, горе и боль вошли в мир и будут в нем существовать до тех пор, пока данный метод произведения потомства заставляет объединяться двоих для продолжения рода. Именно эта великая цель была поставлена перед человечеством для достижения в будущем: слияние двух полюсов созидательной силы, которое сделает человека индивидуальным самодостаточным творцом, что и было предречено в таинственных словах «Человек, познай себя».

Апостол Иоанн в своем первом Послании, третьей главе, 8-м стихе указывает нам путь духовного достижения: «Кто делает грех, тот от диавола... Для сего то и появился Сын Божий, чтобы разрушить дела диавола. Всякий рожденный от Бога не делает греха, потому что семя его пребывает в нем».

Если бы удовлетворялись животные пристрастия и происходило неправильное использование сексуальной энергии, человек легко бы мог стать идиотом, но мысли духовного человека чисты, непорочны и полны мудрости.

В настоящее время соединение полов необходимо для порождения проводников для Эго, стремящихся к возрождению, но придет время, когда человек перестанет создавать их таким путем. Он познает себя. Концентрированная мысль будет сохраняться внутри как семя и проявлять себя посредством гортани как Созидательное Слово, слово, которое будет придавать форму предметам в Физическом мире. Тогда человечеству больше не надо будет искать соединения одного партнера с другим для создания нового проводника. Этому его обучат в мистериальных школах, которые являются промежуточными станциями на пути духовного постижения; потому-то изречение: «Человек, познай себя» и было выгравировано на храме Дельфийского оракула.

### <h3 id="question-175">Вопрос 175</h3>

Что такое Святой Грааль?

Ответ: Сюжет Святого Грааля является одним из мифов, которые использовали великие водители человечества, чтобы в символах донести до нас духовные истины, в то время непостижимые для нашего младенческого разума.

Сюжет Грааля, рассказанный по-разному, можно найти у всех более ранних рас, у которых имелись религиозные учения. Об этой удивительной таинственной панацее от всех болезней были написаны целые библиотеки.

В Средние века различные версии этой легенды разносились менестрелями, трубадурами, или певцами. Самой лучшей версией, пожалуй, был перевод Вольфрама фон Эшенбаха, взятый для работы великим музыкантом девятнадцатого века Рихардом Вагнером для его известной музыкальной драмы «Парсифаль».

Рассказ повествует о том, что во время Тайной вечери со своими учениками Спаситель пил из чаши, или потира, и впоследствии, когда из его раны в боку текла кровь, Иосиф Аримафейский собрал кровь нашего умирающего Спасителя в этот же потир. Он также взял копье, которым была нанесена рана. Эти реликвии на протяжении многих лет он носил с собой, и удивительная дающая жизнь сила крови Спасителя была такой, что поддерживала его во всех лишениях, в тюрьме и скитаниях. Наконец реликвии были взяты на некоторое время на небо под опеку Ангелов, но однажды ночью появился посланник Бога к Святому Титурелю с приказом построить замок высоко в воздухе, на вершине горы, и там собрать вокруг себя группу рыцарей, которые должны быть чисты и безупречны. Этим рыцарям Грааля было разрешено созерцать реликвии в установленное время, и таким образом они вдохновились желанием и силой отправиться в мир, чтобы творить великие духовные подвиги. В свое время Титурель передал охрану Грааля своему сыну Амфортасу, и во время его правления в качестве короля Грааля вместе с рыцарями Грааля произошла ужасная катастрофа.

В «долине язычников» у подножия горы, на которой располагался замок, жил черный рыцарь по имени Клингзор, мечтавший стать Рыцарем Грааля. Он не был безупречен, поэтому, чтобы отвечать требованиям он искалечил себя так, что больше не мог удовлетворять свои желания. Но когда он обратился к святому Титурелю, тот увидел, каково его сердце, и отказал ему. Тогда Клингзор поклялся, что если ему нельзя служить Граалю, то Грааль будет служить ему. Он населил сад своего волшебного замка воображаемыми нереальными прекрасными дамами, которые подстерегали рыцарей Грааля на их пути в замок и из замка, соблазняли их и таким образом делали их негодными для служения в качестве Рыцарей Грааля.

Опасаясь, что все рыцари Грааля окажутся узниками Клингзора, Амфортас решил сразиться с черным магом. Он взял с собой святое копье, чтобы поразить свой объект. Но Клингзор пробудил Кундри, создание, которое вело две жизни. То оно было верным и добросовестным служителем Грааля, то невольным орудием Клингзора. Служа в Граале, Кундри смиренна, послушна и просто застенчива. Под воздействием чар Клингзора она становится необыкновенно красивой женщиной, обладающей завораживающим очарованием, которое она вынуждена использовать по приказанию Клингзора, так как он властвует над ней, поскольку сам не поддается ее очарованию по причине своего увечья.

Кундри встречает Амфортаса, который поддается ее очарованию. Когда он находится в ее объятиях, копье выскальзывает из его руки и поджидающий Клингзор быстро его хватает и наносит Амфортасу незаживающую рану. На протяжении многих лет король переживает мучения, особенно когда он снимает покрывало со святого Грааля для рыцарей. Тогда рана от копья опять начинает кровоточить, причиняя ему самые мучительные страдания.

Следуя одной из возможных интерпретаций, относящихся к тайне Грааля и другим символам, Кундри является отрицательным плотным телом, которое находится то под управлением высшей природы, символизируемой Рыцарями Грааля, то под управлением низшей природы желаний, символизируемой Клингзором, который искушает дух отречься от своих высоких идеалов и приводит к страданиям, если он поддается искушению. В образе Парсифаля мы видим чистого и бесхитростного человека, который преодолевает соблазны и поэтому становится хранителем Грааля.

В страстную пятницу 1857 года, утром, Рихард Вагнер сидел около Цюрихского моря на своей вилле Везендонк, и, где бы ни останавливался его взгляд, везде светило солнце, вся природа улыбалась, и из миллионов спавших в земле семян прорастали многочисленные растения и цветы. Внезапно Вагнера поразила мысль: «В чем связь между смертью Спасителя в это время года и многообразием пробуждающейся жизни?». Эта мысль вплотную подвела его к разгадке тайны Грааля, так как Грааль был школой Мистерий, одной из многих, существовавших в Средние века. Истории о короле Артуре и рыцарях Круглого Стола — не вымысел, это реально происходившие события. Подобная мистерия существовала в Уэльсе во времена королевы Елизаветы. Такие мистериальные школы существуют и по сей день, хотя они не так широко известны, как в более духовные времена Средневековья. Мистерия короля Артура относится в большей степени к материальной и преходящей стороне жизни, чем мистерия Грааля, которая была всецело духовной и чистой. И там ученик получал свое обучение не на словах, ему давалось понимание, идущее изнутри учение, которое можно выразить следующим образом.

Вы видите вокруг себя различные царства мира. Жизнь, присутствующая в каждом из этих царств, является единой всеобщей жизнью Бога, который проявляет себя через все эти разнообразные формы. Когда формы разрушаются, появляется необходимость вместо них создавать другие формы, отсюда порождающая активность, служащая этой цели. В растительном царстве, которое ниже вас, эта активность чиста, целомудренна и безупречна. Она не связана со страстью ни в каком отношении.

В царствах Богов, которые выше вас, порождающая активность продолжается, как чистый и святой процесс воспроизведения. Но в царствах, стоящих между царством растений и богов, все обстоит противоположным непорочности образом. Человек и животные испытывают страсть. На самом деле человек является перевернутым растением. Растение не испытывает стыда и протягивает свои органы созидания, цветы, к солнцу, как создание красоты и очарования, чистое, безупречное и бесстрастное. Человек обращает свои органы созидания к Земле; он со стыдом прячет их, так как они полны страсти. Придет время, и человек станет богом, он будет использовать свои органы созидания на благо остальных, а не для удовлетворения чувств. И таким образом, со временем человек должен стать подобным растениям, но на более высокой ступени. Поэтому, вы видите символ: стручок растения, удерживающий семя, — это чаша цели стремлений, а росток[1], породивший этот цветок, — это солнечный луч. Вам тоже надо научиться принимать солнечную энергию, являющуюся строителем всех форм, и использовать ее в ваших органах созидания без страсти, так, чтобы все, что вы создавали, было зачато непорочно, а не так, как сейчас, порождалось бы во грехе.

Сок растения течет по его зеленому стеблю к листьям неокрашенным, чистым и безупречным. Ваша кровь — красная и наполнена страстью, но при возрождении она должна очиститься духовными силами, которые придут к вам от Духовного Солнца подобно тому, как энергия физического Солнца порождает сок растения. И после такого возрождения вы умрете, как человек, который должен воскреснуть Богом.

Как были связаны строители пирамид в Египте и строители пирамид в Центральной Америке? Какая цивилизация более древняя?

Ответ: Исследователи-антропологи показали, что у расы негров длинная узкая голова, узкие глазные впадины и плоский волос. У монголов, индейцев и других родственных им народов круглая голова, круглые глазные впадины и их волос круглый. Голова у представителей белой расы овальная, как и глазные впадины и волос. Это показывает, что на Земле есть три типа людей. Раса негров осталась от лемурийской расы, которая жила в третью эпоху развития Земли. Монголы, индейцы и ряд других народностей остались от людей Атлантиды, и белые народы — это представители нынешней арийской расы. Исследования покажут, что египтяне принадлежат к арийским расам, тогда как ацтеки демонстрируют особенности черепа, глазных впадин и волос, характерные для людей Атлантиды. Поэтому эта цивилизация более древняя, чем египетская. О пирамидах Центральной Америки было написано немного, но Пьяцци Смит и Ричард Проктор, два профессиональных астронома, написали достаточно о пирамидах Египта и постарались выяснить, для чего они применялись. На основании результатов измерения пирамид Пьяцци Смит выводит теорию о том, что они были построены божественными архитекторами, теорию, которую профессор Проктор высмеивает, хотя признает, что измерения подтверждают теории профессора Смита. Он относит к совпадению то, что основание пирамиды имеет размер во столько сотен дюймов, сколько дней в году; что длина диагоналей основания в дюймах равна количеству лет в великом сидерическом мировом году. Просто профессор Проктор получил такие результаты при расчетах. Однако подобные совпадения столь многочисленны, что для беспристрастного ума они являются воплощением определенного замысла. Профессор Проктор, который невольно подтвердил теорию о том, что пирамида была предназначена для астрологических целей, вносит ценные дополнения в свое свидетельство, соглашаясь, что из всех гипотез об использовании пирамид теория о том, что они строились для астрологических целей, единственная, способная выдержать возражения. Поэтому, хотя он и отзывался о ней как о нелепой теории, это единственная разумная теория, соответствующая фактам.

В действительности пирамиды были храмами посвящения, построенными Иерофантами малых Мистерий, и, поскольку посвящение кандидатов основано на перемещении небесных тел, звезд, через двенадцать знаков зодиака, поэтому, естественно, эти храмы посвящения олицетворяют все космические размеры. Среди египетских пирамид так использовалась только пирамида Хеопса. Остальные были лишь имитациями, построенными позднее другими фараонами. Малые Мистерии существовали в различных частях света в разное время — в Индии, Египте, Греции, а также в Центральной Америке. Поэтому связь между строителями пирамид в одной части света с другой заключается в том, что они все были Иерофантами малых Мистерий, и их храмы использовались для целей посвящения.

### <h3 id="question-177">Вопрос 177</h3>

В чем существенная разница между учениями розенкрейцеров и ортодоксальной церкви?

Ответ: Есть много отличий, но, наверное, главное отличие заключается в том, что согласно учению ортодоксов при каждом рождении вновь созданная душа вступает в материальное существование необученной Богом, что она живет здесь, в материальном теле, больший или меньший промежуток времени и после смерти переходит в невидимый загробный мир, чтобы остаться там навечно в состоянии счастья или несчастья, в зависимости от того, что она совершала, будучи в теле.

Учение розенкрейцеров утверждает, что каждая душа — неотъемлемая часть Бога, которая стремится получить опыт путем повторяющихся существований в постепенно улучшающихся материальных телах. Поэтому она входит в материю и выходит из нее много раз и каждый раз собирает немного больше опыта, чем было у нее раньше, со временем продвигаясь от неведения к всеведению благодаря этому опыту.

Наше чувство справедливости восстает против учения, которое посылает одну душу в дом культурной и благородной семьи, где она использует преимущества изобилия, где растущему ребенку прививаются моральные нормы, а другого посылает в трущобы, его отец вор, а его мать, возможно, распутница, и где его обучение заключается в обмане, воровстве и так далее. Если бы здесь мы оказывались только однажды, то у всех был бы одинаковый шанс и всех судили бы по одним и тем же законам, но мы знаем, что нет двух людей с одинаковым жизненным опытом. Мы знаем, что там, где один встречает множество соблазнов, другой остается относительно незатронутым жизненными бурями. Поэтому, когда одна душа помещается в высоконравственное окружение, а другая в безнравственное, неверно посылать одну душу на небо для наслаждения и вечного блаженства за совершенные ею благие поступки, которых она не могла не совершать. Так же неверно посылать другую в ад за грабеж и разбой, когда окружение и условия, в которые душа была брошена, были такими, что человек не мог сдерживать себя.

Поэтому учение розенкрейцеров утверждает, что мы приходим в то место, которое больше всего соответствует полученному нами опыту в прежних жизнях. Мы получаем то, что заслужили во всех предыдущих случаях; весь опыт, который приходит к нам, — именно тот, который нам нужен, чтобы дать нам должный толчок для следующего шага в нашем развитии.

### <h3 id="question-178">Вопрос 178</h3>

Пожалуйста, изложите основные положения, по которым философия розенкрейцеров отличается от теософии.

Ответ: Нас заботит не столько поиск различий, сколько нахождение точек соприкосновения. Тем не менее можно сказать, что философия розенкрейцеров — это западное учение, данное людям Запада в данный период их духовного развития. Если взять слово «теософия» в буквальном смысле, то есть как «божественную мудрость» (теософия), тогда, конечно, философия розенкрейцеров является лишь частью божественной мудрости, как и все другие религиозные системы. Но если мы рассмотрим теософию в значении, провозглашенным Теософским Обществом (или Обществами, так как существует несколько ответвлений), то можно сказать, что учение розенкрейцеров гораздо более всеобъемлющее и законченное. Сверх того, при обучении философии розенкрейцеры придерживаются диаметрально противоположного метода по отношению к методу Теософского Общества, который имеет целью:

1) образование ядер всеобщего Братства;

2) изучение сравнительной религии;

3) исследование необъяснимых законов природы и сил, дремлющих в человеке.

Братья Креста и Роз утверждают, что большинство передовых людей симпатизируют идее всемирного Братства и что не надо быть теософами, чтобы вынашивать эту идею в глубине души. Остальные бесчисленные общества тоже проповедуют альтруистические идеи, созвучные братским. Многие ученые изучают сравнительную религию и делают это прекрасно. Не надо быть теософом, чтобы следовать этой цели, но необходимо быть эзотериком, чтобы достичь третьей цели Теософского Общества, а именно изучать необъяснимые законы природы и силы, дремлющие в человеке.

Поэтому розенкрейцеры рекомендуют сосредоточить все мысли на том, чтобы вести такую жизнь и практиковать такие упражнения, которые разовьют дремлющие силы в каждом ученике, так что он сможет увидеть и узнать невидимые миры, откуда приходят причины, проявления которых мы видим здесь. Когда эта цель будет достигнута, но никак не раньше, тогда ученик сможет исследовать необъяснимые законы природы. Тогда он находится в лучшем положении, чем ученые или кто-либо другой, для изучения сравнительной религии. Так как он видит центральный источник, из которого берут начало все религии, каждая из которых приспособлена для того народа, которому дается. Он также видит, как они вписаны в великую схему эволюции, и, когда он сможет достичь сознания внутренних миров, единство жизни становится столь явным, что ему даже не надо беспокоиться о первой цели Теософского Общества, так как всеобщность Единой Жизни, делающая братство реальностью в природе, превыше необходимости ее утверждать.

Чтобы достичь этой последней ступени, нам необходимо правильно взглянуть на этот предмет. Мы можем проповедовать печке, что ее долг — разогреваться и согревать нас, но, пока мы не будем следовать законам ее функционирования и не положим в нее топливо, наши проповеди не возымеют действия. Точно так же, пока мы не достигнем той ступени высоты, где наши сердца наполняются божественной любовью, мы можем проповедовать и предлагать учения о всеобщем Братстве, но это не принесет блага. Если мы наполним печь топливом, это нас согреет, и, если мы наполним наши сердца любовью, они будут излучать это качество без объявления цели, такой, которая была упомянута первой.

Поэтому основное различие между Теософским Обществом и Братством розенкрейцеров заключается в полной противоположности метода. Тогда как Теософское Общество стремится образовать ядра всеобщего Братства путем изучения сравнительной религии и только в последнюю очередь обсуждать развитие скрытой стороны человеческой природы, — а многие даже осуждают развитие скрытых способностей — учение розенкрейцеров побуждает ученика прежде всего жить, сконцентрировать все силы своего существа на работе души, чтобы приготовиться к обладанию душевными силами, важнейшими для исследований, которые он собирается предпринять.

### <h3 id="question-179">Вопрос 179</h3>

Тождественна ли Белая Ложа Теософского Общества Церкви розенкрейцеров?

Ответ: Нет, Теософское Общество просто эзотерическая организация для распространения определенной философии, в основном вышедшей из восточных религий, тогда как Братство розенкрейцеров стремится пропагандировать учения западной школы Мистерий, то есть Ордена розенкрейцеров, который является тайным орденом, недоступным для тех, кто не получил полное Посвящение.

Что касается отношения Ордена розенкрейцеров и родственных мистериальных орденов, относящихся к Белой Ложе, можно сказать, что в разных частях Земли есть некоторое количество этих школ малых Мистерий, каждая из которых состоит из двенадцати братьев, а также тринадцатого члена ордена. Последний является главой ордена и связующим звеном между разными школами. Эти главы составляют то, что обычно известно как Белая Ложа, а именно высший конклав Старших среди наших Братьев, которые сейчас несут полную ответственность за эволюцию и планируют шаги, которым мы должны следовать, чтобы продвигаться.

### <h3 id="question-180">Вопрос 180</h3>

Что вы понимаете под термином «Учитель», и вдохновляют ли Учителя движение Братства розенкрейцеров?

Ответ: На Востоке ученик, который стремится к высшей жизни, ищет Учителя и связан по рукам и ногам, образно говоря, этим Учителем. Он должен слепо следовать указаниям своего Учителя, без малейшего колебания или проявления любопытства по поводу цели получаемых указаний. Он должен воздавать Учителю личной службой, какая бы ему ни потребовалась, во что бы то ни стало или ценой личных неудобств. Таким образом, за короткое время он практически становится рабом подчас очень требовательного надсмотрщика.

Этот метод кажется весьма варварским, но это, без сомнения, единственный способ для жителей Востока преодолеть леность, и, поскольку они являются отсталым классом Эго, их приучают к раболепию и покорности, не причиняя неприятностей их более тонким чувствам. Но здесь, на Западе, такой метод был бы совершенно оскорбительным, так как мы уже продвинулись на такую ступень развития индивидуальности, что можем двигаться вперед только за счет воздействия, исходящего изнутри. Давая какие-то обещания или клятвы, мы не должны ни с кем себя связывать, а давать обещания и клятвы себе, поскольку, если мы не можем оставаться верными в клятве самим себе, мы, безусловно, не сможем выполнить обещание, данное другим людям.

Более того, мы можем нарушить обещание, данное кому-то еще, и ввести его в заблуждение, заставив думать, что мы верны своему слову, но мы не можем обмануть себя. Если мы нарушим обещание, данное самим себе, мы сразу об этом узнаем. Поэтому ученика на Западе обучают давать обещания самому себе, так как это имеет большую силу, чем любая клятва, данная кому-то другому. Учитель на Западе — самый близкий друг и советчик ученика, так как он следует примеру Христа, который говорил своим ученикам: «Сия есть заповедь Моя, да любите друг друга, как Я возлюбил вас. Нет больше той любви, как если кто положит душу свою за друзей своих. Вы друзья Мои, если исполняете то, что Я заповедую вам. Я уже не называю вас рабами, ибо раб не знает, что делает господин его; но Я назвал вас друзьями, потому что сказал вам все, что слышал от Отца Моего». (Ин., 15:12-15, курсив М.Г.).

Эти учителя не связаны прямо с Братством розенкрейцеров; они дали определенные учения автору при условии, что он приложит все усилия, чтобы их распространить и объявит о своей готовности помочь тем, кто получит право следовать этому учению. Изучающие эти учения объединяются в группы для совместной работы, но нет жестких или устойчивых организаций, как нет и намерения создать такую организацию, но учащиеся рады предоставить людям эти учения в любом месте. Мы предпочитаем, чтобы они оставались в своих церквях.

### <h3 id="question-181">Вопрос 181</h3>

Если тот, кто искренне верит в распространяемые розенкрейцерами учения, утверждает, что они истинны, то нет ли для него опасности оказаться догматичным и нетерпимым к мнению остальных? И каким должно быть его отношение к тем, кто отказывается принимать эти учения?

Ответ: Необыкновенно важно, чтобы мы осознали тот факт, что, по крайней мере, в нашем теперешнем ограниченном существовании мы вряд ли сможем постичь окончательную истину. Поэтому то, что нам кажется «правдой и только правдой», скорее всего, в конце концов, лишь часть правды. Развиваясь, мы становимся способны понять все больше и больше, меняются наши представления о жизни, мире и Боге. Поэтому всегда необходимо сохранять восприимчивость ума, чтобы можно было воспринять новую правду. И хотя нам следует не становиться равнодушными, а всегда оставаться ревностными по отношению к тому, что мы считаем правдой, мы не должны забывать, что есть еще более великие истины, о которых мы пока не знаем. Если мы обладаем восприимчивым умом, мы не впадем в фанатизм или закоснелость. Некоторые люди переполняются чрезмерным энтузиазмом, если находят что-то, что кажется им истиной, и они тут же начинают настоящий крестовый поход, чтобы склонить остальных к своей точке зрения. Такое поведение глубоко ошибочно. Если мы пойдем в церковь и начнем задавать вопросы, которые породят сомнения в умах прихожан и пробудят беспокойство в отношении их веры, мы легко можем породить ужасное состояние разброда. Если все, что мы должны дать, привлекает их и становится их спасением, тогда они могут остановиться на новой и более возвышенной вере, подлинной и целесообразной. Но если происходит так, что то, что мы им предлагаем, выше их понимания и потому неприемлемо, мы можем вызвать у них чрезвычайно подавленное настроение и они могут обратиться к материализму, атеизму или другому скептическому мировосприятию. В этом случае их жизни будут на нашей совести. Нам следует взять за правило в этом мире сохранять молчание относительно того, во что мы верим и во что мы не верим, хотя при подходящей возможности можно и проронить слово, и, если это слово вызовет расспросы, мы должны бесстрашно отвечать на них. Таким образом, мы постепенно поведем спрашивающего вперед. Тем самым его не будут вести, пока он не устремится сам, и, когда он выяснит, что жаждет информации, мы должны предоставить ему все, что он хочет, и притом бесплатно. Но мы повторяем, что тот, кто навязывает свое мнение не желающему слушать или неготовому человеку, возлагает на себя серьезную ответственность.

### <h3 id="question-182">Вопрос 182</h3>

Как получается, что немногие из тех, кто изучает высшую философию, заинтересованы в улучшении условий производства, таких, как отмена подневольного наемного труда, который так же унизителен и бесчеловечен, как рабство негров?

Ответ: Все эзотерики сознают вопиющие потребности современности, и никто не жаждет более горячо, чем они, дня освобождения, дня, когда братская любовь станет реальностью, когда нации «перекуют мечи свои на орала, и копья свои — на серпы», как пророчествовал Исаия, но они приступают к созданию таких условий совсем по-другому. Социалистические профсоюзы и им подобные организации стремятся к лучшим условиям, но эзотерики утверждают, что их методы неэффективны, они срывают устойчивое достижение своих целей, так как не может быть сомнения, что именно человек создает условия, а не условия создают человека. Поэтому, если мы стремимся к человечеству более высокого уровня, мы уточняем его критерии правильного и неправильного и стремимся возвысить его идеалы. Тогда, если человек станет лучше, как естественное следствие, улучшатся и условия.

В нынешнем состоянии, когда трудовые союзы, угрожая нанимателю забастовкой, добиваются улучшения условий, наниматель начинает составлять план, как он может их остановить и сорвать достижение их цели. Он объединяется с другими нанимателями для взаимной защиты, и эти организации всегда находятся в состоянии войны с трудовыми союзами. Лучшие условия, которых добился кто-то один, постепенно принимаются и другими. Однако, если бы наниматель, как и ищущий работу, применяли принципы христианства и научились поступать с другими так, как они хотят, чтобы с ними поступали другие, тогда не было бы необходимости в трудовых союзах. Ибо наниматели все делали бы ради благополучия своих наемных работников и предугадывали бы их желания. Эзотерик уверен, что такое положение вещей может осуществиться посредством усердного размышления на эту тему, так как все вещи и все условия сначала были мыслями в умах людей. Поэтому он искренне молится, чтобы умы людей стали восприимчивы к реальности всеобщего Братства, чтобы они приняли в свои сердца любовь Бога и объединились в стремлении к правому делу вместо того, чтобы планировать, как угнетать своего ближнего.

### <h3 id="question-183">Вопрос 183</h3>

Можно ли изучать эзотерику, вести высшую жизнь и быть миллионером?
Ответ: Христос сказал богатому молодому человеку: «Пойди, раздай что имеешь, и следуй за Мной», но, поскольку молодой человек был очень привязан к роскоши, он в печали ушел, и Христос сделал замечание относительно того, как трудно богатому войти на небо. Он не сказал, что это невозможно, но он знал, что в богатстве кроются ловушка и искушение. Тем не менее человек может быть миллионером и все же стремиться к высшей жизни. Богатство является препятствием и путами, но было бы абсолютно неверно делать вывод, что богатство мешает эзотерическому развитию. Все зависит от того, как человек относится к своему богатству. Если он использует его для самовозвеличивания и подавления своих ближних, тогда, безусловно, не может быть духовного роста. Но если человек считает себя распорядителем своего имущества и намеревается построить заводы с образцовыми условиями, образцовыми многоквартирными домами и так далее, если он сам активно работает, чтобы увидеть, как его благотворительные идеи претворяются в жизнь и его ближние получают хорошие условия жизни и любую возможность самосовершенствования, тогда богатство — огромная благая сила. Если человек таким образом бескорыстно трудится на благо ближнего, у него не будет возможности подумать о самосовершенствовании, и его духовный рост в большей степени будет бессознательным, нежели сознательным. Тем не менее его духовный рост будет огромным, и его возможности сделать большую и лучшую работу с годами будут увеличиваться в этой жизни, как и в последующих жизнях. Вот в чем на самом деле был смысл притчи о талантах. Те, кто использовал свои таланты, были назначены правителями ряда городов, чтобы дать им соответствующую работу в эволюционной схеме. С другой стороны, если человек имеет завод, а стремление к эзотерическому развитию полностью поглощает его и он эгоистично продает свой завод, оставляя своих рабочих безработными, чтобы развивать собственные способности и вести высшую жизнь, такой человек пренебрегает своим долгом и без сомнения получит упрек от своего Господина, так как он зарыл свой талант. И в будущей жизни он окажется лишенным той возможности, которой он пренебрег.

### <h3 id="question-184">Вопрос 184</h3>

Считаете ли вы правильной смертную казнь? Не является ли она более милосердной, чем пожизненное заключение?

Ответ: У дикарей кто силен, тот и прав, сильный всегда побеждает слабого. Мы гордимся тем, что в своей цивилизации поднялись на более высокую ступень и практикуем альтруизм во всех областях государственного устройства. Тем не менее, хотя мы и не выходим с дубинкой, чтобы беспорядочно убивать своих воображаемых врагов, кроме как на войне, мы все же продолжаем убивать «по закону». Было время, когда по закону вора вешали. В наше время мы называем такое наказание варварским, но смертная казнь пока остается пятном позора для нашей цивилизации. Кроме того, мы более утонченны в своей жестокости, чем люди древних цивилизаций, так как они вешали или обезглавливали так называемых преступников тотчас же. Мы же держим преступника в заключении годами, подвергаем его пытке долгих слушаний дела в суде присяжных, задолго назначаем день казни и предоставляем ему возможность тем временем испытывать смертные муки ожидания в течении всего оставшегося времени.

Мы заявляем, что нашей целью является не возмездие, а защита интересов общества, чтобы охранять его и удерживать других от совершения подобных преступлений, но тем не менее смертная казнь содействует убийству. Если у человека есть наклонности к убийству, его необходимо должным образом ограничивать, так чтобы он не причинял вреда своему ближнему. Однако если мы его убьем, мы не ограничим его, смерть освободит его в мире Желаний, а поскольку мир Желаний находится вокруг нас, он будет обладать полной свободой ходить среди людей и внушать им мысли ненависти и мщения обществу. Поэтому количество убийств растет. Кроме того, мания убийства поддерживается прессой. Яркие заголовки, перечисляющие наводящие ужас подробности преступлений, провоцируют остальных к подобным действиям. Если бы пресса просто хранила молчание об убийствах и самоубийствах, в стране было бы гораздо меньше преступлений. Отрадно видеть, что существует по крайней мере несколько газет, например издания «Христианской Науки», которые отказываются печатать то, что не является благим известием.

Относительно части вопроса, в которой говорится: «Не лучше ли смерть, чем пожизненное заключение?», можно сказать: «Возможно, при данной тюремной системе, что лучше». Но эта область наших учреждений также требует изменений, и нам многое надо сделать и изменить в отношении обращения с теми, кого мы называем преступниками. Они наши братья в той же степени, как и так называемые респектабельные члены общества, которые не были уличены в преступлениях. Правда, мы немного улучшили жизнь в тюрьме, сделали ее менее варварской, чем раньше. Также правда, что теперь есть испытательный срок и условный приговор, но мы все еще далеки от того, чтобы обращаться с этими более слабыми братьями соответствующим образом. Если бы мы могли как следует осознать, что они наши братья, и обращались с ними, как со слабым братом, который также является сыном нашей матери, мы бы поступали более правильно. Кто из нас, если его собственный брат совершил проступок, пошлет его в тюрьму или будет называть «уголовником», когда ему прочтут приговор, или захочет изгнать его на всю жизнь из-за его слабости? Если человек заболел тифозной горячкой, мы не сердимся на него, а посылаем его в больницу на месяц, пока он не поправится. Мы о нем хорошо заботимся, чтобы помочь его выздоровлению, и радуемся вместе с ним, когда он выздоравливает. Преступник слаб и болен психически. Его не следует посылать в тюрьму для отбытия срока. Его надо отправить в учреждение, где бы его правильно обучали и помогли преодолеть его слабость. Пока мы не будем относиться к нашим слабым братьям с полной любви заботой, мы не сможем сказать, что мы поднялись над варварским принципом, требующим «око за око». Как мы осмеливаемся молить Бога: «Прости нам долги наши, как и мы прощаем должникам нашим», если мы обращаемся с нашими бедными братьями так, как сейчас?

### <h3 id="question-185">Вопрос 185</h3>

Какова ваша точка зрения относительно избирательного права женщин?

Ответ: Дух не имеет ни женского, ни мужского пола, но проявляется поочередно как мужчина и женщина, поэтому, если рассматривать избирательное право женщин с более высокой позиции, для современных мужчин было бы выгодно предоставить женщинам избирательное право, которое поистине является их правом, — совершенное и полное равенство во всем. С двойными общественными стандартами, существующими в настоящее время, когда мужчина может совершать социальный проступок, не подвергаясь остракизму, необходимо покончить. Женский труд должен оплачиваться так же, как и мужской, и в любом случае необходимо следовать направлениям развития, превосходно сформулированным в романе Эдварда Беллами «Оглядываясь назад».

Целесообразность такого справедливого социального устройства станет очевидной, если посмотреть на жизнь с той точки зрения, что земная жизнь лишь одна из многих и что мы рождаемся по очереди то мужчиной, то женщиной. Но существуют и другие причины, по которым женщинам надо предоставить право голоса. У мужчины плотное тело положительно, и положительные силы мужчины в высокой степени сконцентрированы на Химическом слое Физического мира. Он особенно интересуется тем, что можно взвесить, измерить, проанализировать и с чем можно работать в повседневной жизни. Его развитие идет в основном в материальном направлении, он формирует Землю и все, находящееся на ней, приводит в соответствие со своими представлениями. Но он очень мало интересуется или не интересуется вовсе духовной стороной жизни.

С другой стороны, женщина обладает положительным жизненным телом и, как следствие, интуитивно находится в соприкосновении с духовными вибрациями вселенной. Она более идеалистична, в большей степени одарена воображением и очень интересуется всем, что служит духовному подъему расы. И поскольку человечество в настоящее время может продвигаться вперед только за счет внутреннего и духовного роста, женщина в действительности является основным фактором эволюции. Если бы женщине предоставили равные права с мужчиной во всем, то это было бы огромным благом для расы. Так как только после этого мы можем надеяться на осуществление преобразований, которые на самом деле объединят человечество. Мы видим подобное положение вещей и в семье, где женщина является главной опорой, объединяющей вокруг себя детей и мужа. В соответствии со своими способностями она создает дом таким, какой он есть, она выполняет функцию соединяющего фактора и миротворца. Отец может покинуть семью или умереть, дети могут уехать, но, пока остается мать, остается домашний очаг. Если же смерть уносит мать, семья сразу разваливается.

Некоторые могут поспорить: «Конечно, но, когда женщину отнимает от семьи политика, семья разрушается точно так же». Но не надо этого бояться. Во время переходного периода и, возможно, какое-то время спустя, пока женщины не приспособятся, они в некоторых случаях могут пренебрегать семьей, но там, где уже были сделаны попытки, семьи не распадались, но было сделано много хорошего, так что можно рассчитывать, что женщины будут поддерживать все улучшения из соображений нравственности. Хотя законы — лишь замена восхождению человечества к высшим планам, где каждый будет законом для самого себя, творя добро без принуждения, тем не менее необходимо, чтобы такие преобразования были произведены в настоящее время законодательным путем.

Если эзотерики отказываются от использования мяса в пищу, потому что при ее приготовлении неизбежна трагедия, а они не хотят быть отнимающей жизнь стороной как непосредственно, так и косвенно, то не отнимаем ли мы также жизнь, когда употребляем в пищу яйца или фрукты, овощи и так далее?

Ответ: Случай, затронутый спрашивающим, сильно отличается от того, когда отнимают жизнь, убивая животное. В действительности, чтобы добыть мясо животного, его необходимо убить, и поэтому мы причиняем ему вред, но мы на самом деле помогаем дереву, когда снимаем с него плод, что станет сразу же ясным, если мы разберемся в процессе развития.

С животными происходит то же самое, что и с человеческими существами, и на самом деле, со всеми царствами. Когда животное должно родиться, Групповой Дух, которому помогают духи природы и Ангелы, формирует жизненное тело рождающегося животного, которое затем помещается в лоно матери, а атомы-семена помещаются в сперму самца; затем происходит зачатие и рождается животное. При отсутствии атома-семени и матрицы жизненного тела не может сформироваться плотное тело ни одного животного. Подобные условия управляют зачатием яйца или семени растения. Как и в случае с женской яйцеклеткой, есть много вариантов развития событий. Если яйцо помещают в инкубатор или под курицу, Групповой Дух высылает требуемую жизнь, принимая возможность воплощения. Если семечко брошено в землю, оно также оплодотворяется, если были подготовлены подходящие условия для его развития, но не раньше. Если яйцо разбито, приготовлено или стало непригодным для его прямого назначения или если семечко хранилось на протяжении многих лет, после чего, возможно, там уже нет жизни, мы, следовательно, не причиняем вреда, если используем эти продукты в пищу. А для растений даже полезно, когда снимают спелые плоды, потому что тогда они перестают истощать растение.

Не то ли страшное существо видел Глиндон в «Зенони» Бульвера Литтона, что и мистер Хайд в рассказе Роберта Л. Стивенсона?

Ответ: Нет. В некоторых отношениях есть сходство, но в остальном — огромная разница. Об ужасном существе, которое видел Глиндон, в эзотерике говорят как о Страже Порога. Когда неофит сознательно вступает в мир Желаний, оставив свое физическое тело спящим, он должен пройти мимо существа, подобного тому, которое описал Глиндон. Оно является воплощением всех злых дел человека в прошлом, которые еще не искуплены и должны быть искоренены в будущих жизнях. Он должен узнать и признать это существо частью себя самого. Он должен пообещать себе погасить как можно скорее все долги, представленные в этом ужасном образе.

Это существо даже не видно обычному человеку, когда он находится между смертью и новым рождением, хотя оно всегда присутствует. Это существо — демон; существует и компенсирующая его противоположность, олицетворение всего хорошего, что человек совершил в прошлом, его можно назвать Ангелом-хранителем. Но эти парные образы, как было сказано, никогда не видимы обычному человеку, хотя всегда реально существуют в его жизни.

Однако иногда случается, что у умирающего человека природа желаний столь сильная, что после того как он искупил свои поступки, она остается в чистилище, и, когда он вступает на Второе небо, эта оболочка не распадается, а сохраняется, пока человек не рождается опять. Тогда она притягивается к нему силой магнетического притяжения и он становится обладателем как будто бы двойного тела желаний. Тело желаний прошлой жизни может время от времени заставить себя почувствовать и послужить причиной двойной жизни человека (о чем и рассказано Робертом Льюисом Стивенсоном), заставляя его делать то, что было ему отвратительно, так как страдания, порожденные искуплением этих поступков, становятся совестью и заставляют противостоять злу. Однако, к счастью, подобные случаи крайне редки в наше время.

### <h3 id="question-188">Вопрос 188</h3>

Если ампутировать руку человека, оторвать ветку дерева и посредством взрыва снести часть утеса, будут ли невидимые двойники этих разных объектов также разъединены?

Ответ: В случае с ампутированной рукой эфирный двойник все же останется с жизненным телом, хотя существует определенная магнетическая связь между ним и физической рукой, которая похоронена. Зафиксирован случай, происшедший с человеком, у которого была ампутирована рука. Он жаловался на сильную боль, будто кто-то прокалывал ему плоть руки. Боли продолжались несколько недель, пока наконец рука не была откопана и не обнаружили, что в ящике был гвоздь, который вбили в плоть руки как раз в том месте, где человек чувствовал боль. Когда гвоздь вытащили, боль прошла. Люди с ампутированными руками или ногами иногда жалуются на боль в конечности в течение нескольких лет после операции. Потом боль прекращается, так как эфирная рука разлагается в могиле одновременно с конечностью.

Жизненное тело растения состоит только из двух видов самого плотного эфира — химического эфира и жизненного эфира, которые дают растению возможность расти и размножаться. Но у него нет эфира двух высших видов — светового эфира и отражающего эфира, поэтому у него нет эмоций или памяти того, что происходит вокруг. Поэтому растение не чувствует боли, когда срезают ветку, а что касается скалы, которую взрывают, то в ней присутствует только химический эфир, так что кристаллы совсем ничего не чувствуют. Все же было бы неправильно заключить, что в этих двух случаях совсем нет никаких ощущений. Хотя растения и минералы не обладают индивидуальной способностью чувствовать, они окутаны и пронизаны эфирами и миром Желаний планеты, а Планетарный Дух чувствует все. Наш палец, который не имеет индивидуального тела желаний, не может чувствовать, но мы, внутрисущие духи, населяющие тело, чувствуем любую травму, нанесенную пальцу.

### <h3 id="question-189">Вопрос 189</h3>

Знаете ли вы такое место, дом или убежище, куда можно уехать, чтобы вести прекрасную, простую и невинную жизнь, которую вы пропагандируете?

Ответ: Нет, мы не знаем такого приюта, и, если бы для этой цели был основан такой приют, нам было бы очень жаль его обитателей. Если бы мы были в высоком расположении духа и отправились бы в горы, чтобы вести там жизнь отшельников, где нет людей, которые могут действовать нам на нервы, невелика наша заслуга, если мы не раздражаемся на окружающих. Если нам трудно преодолеть свои пороки или недостатки в городе и мы отправляемся в пустынные места, где эти искушения не существуют, невелика наша заслуга в том, что мы им не поддаемся. Нас поместили в города среди наших собратьев, чтобы мы привыкли к ним и договаривались с ними, научились сдерживать себя, несмотря на любые раздражители, научились избегать искушений там, где они существуют. Кто-то может жить в горах, а его сердце — находиться в городе; или он может запереться в монастыре и все еще тосковать по удовольствиям мира. Лучше всего оставаться там, где мы оказались, и там развивать душевные качества, которые сделают нас лучше. Есть работа, которую надо выполнять в мире, и, если мы убежим из мира, как мы ее выполним? У нас есть обязанности по отношению к нашим ближним. Не выполняя своих обязанностей, мы уклоняемся от своего долга, и судьба обязательно вернет нас в то окружение, из которого мы не сможем убежать. Поэтому лучше поставить себе цель усвоить все уроки, которые рядом с нами, вместо того чтобы от них убегать.
