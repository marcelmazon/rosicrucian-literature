    - [Question No. 29: When children do not come to a man and wife who deeply long for them, is there not some way to induce some soul in the unseen world to accept their invitation to reincarnate?

    - [Question No. 65: Why, with a few exceptions, are we reincarnated without having the slightest knowledge of any previous existence, and thus suffer blindly in this life for transgressions of which we are entirely ignorant, committed in some former life?

    - [Question No. 72: How can you believe in the theory of reincarnation--that we come back here in the body of an animal? Is it not much more beautiful to believe in the Christian doctrine that we go to heaven with God and the Angels?](#question-72)

Is the geocentric concerned only with the affairs of this earth, the material life, and the heliocentric with the soul or the spiritual side?

    - [Question No. 165: Are not enormous and destructive reptiles created by the evil thoughts of men, so far as the form is concerned? And, therefore, is it not an act of love to kill them and thus liberate the divine spark within so that it may occupy a higher form?](#question-165)

### <h3 id="a-word-of-explanation">КРАТКО ВЪВЕДЕНИЕ</h3>

Въпросите, разгледани в тази книга, са били задавани на автора след изнасяните от него лекции в различни градове и, в повечето случаи, тези въпроси показват известни познания относно предмета от страна на задаващия въпроса. 

Ще бъде, може би, от полза за тези които не са запознати с ‘’Космогонията на Розенкройцерите’’ да предоставя следната информация относно философията и използваните термини. По този начин за всеки ще бъде лесно да разбере отговорите на въпросите. Тук е мястото, може би, да заявя че на всеки въпрос е даден отговор независимо от това какво е съдържанието на отговора на който и да било друг въпрос, така че всеки отговор е завършен сам за себе си. Това е довело понякога до повторения на някои неща в отговорите на подобни въпроси. Но ще стане ясно, че във всички случаи където съществува такова повторение, то изразява нов аспект на предмета, така че не нужно авторът да се извинява, защото той смята този използван метод за по-добър отколкото да се прави справка с някой друг отговор за което питащият, може би, няма да има време 

Философията на Розенкройцерите учи, че човекът е комплексно същество, което притежава: 

(1) Плътно Тяло, което е видимият инструмент който той използва тук на този свят; тялото за което обикновено ние мислим че е целия човек. 

(2) Витално Тяло, което е изградено от Етер и обхваща и прониква видимото тяло както Етерът прониква всички останали форми с тази разлика, че човешките същества си служат с по-голямо количество от универсалния (или всеобщия) етер, отколкото другите форми. Това етерно тяло е нашия инструмент за усвояване на виталната енергия на Слънцето. 

(3) Тяло на Желанията, което е нашата емоционална природа. Това ефирно тяло-носител прониква двете тела – плътното и виталното. То се вижда от ясновидското зрение като издадено около 16 инча (около 40 сантиметра) извън нашето видимо тяло, което е поместено в центъра на този обхващащ го облак като жълтък в средата на яйце. 

(4) Умът, който е огледало отразяващо отвъдния свят и който дава възможност на Его да предава управляващите си команди като мисли и думи, и също така да предизвиква действие. 

Его е тройният дух който използва тези тела-носители* за да натрупва опит в училището на живота. 

() - тела-носители* - Във всички издания на ‘’Космогонията на Розенкройцерите’’, преведена на български от Христо Маджаров, английската дума ‘’vehicle’’ е преведена като ‘’връзка’’. Тук думата ‘’vehicle’’ е преведена като ‘’тяло-носител’’ или ‘’носител’’. 

() - ‘’връзка’’ на Его със света (околната среда) от чиято материя е изградено съответното тяло (например плътното тяло е връзка на Его с физическия свят). 

<h2 id="section-1">РАЗДЕЛ I: Въпроси отнасящи се до ЖИВОТ НА ЗЕМЯТА</h2>

### <h3 id="question-1">ВЪПРОС No.1</h3>

Ако ние сме били девствен (чист) дух и част от Всезнаещия Бог, защо е било необходимо за нас да предприемем това дълго странстване, придружено с грях и мъка, през материята? 

Отговор: В началото на проявлението, Бог е диференцирал вътре в себе си множество от духовни интелигенции* с потенциална възможност за развитие, както искрите се излъчват от огъня. Така тези духовни интелигенции са били потенциални пламъци, но все още не са били истински огън, понеже при все че са били надарени с все-съзнанието на Бог, на тях им е липсвало себе-съзнание; бидейки потенциално всемогъщи като Бог, те не са имали динамична сила (или енергия, мощ) за да използват във всеки момент съобразно желанието си; и за да бъдат развити тези качества (или способности) е било задължително те да минат през материята. Поради това, през Инволюцията всяка Божествена искра е била капсулирана в различни тела-носители с достатъчна плътност, която да изключи външния свят от съзнанието й. Тогава, Духът който е вътре, вече неспособен да контактува с външния свят, се обръща навътре и открива Себе си. Със събуденото себе- съзнание обаче се появява усилието на духа да се освободи от този затвор и през Еволюцията различните носители, които духът притежава, ще бъдат одухотворени (спиритуализирани) в душа, така че в края на проявлението духът не само ще има придобито себе -съзнание, но още и душа-сила (душевна сила).

() - ‘’intelligence’’ – интелигентна или разумна същност, предено навсякъде като ‘’интелигенция’’. 

Съществува тенденцията, сред по-голямата част от хората, да вярват че всичко което съществува е константна даденост, без оставена възможност за добавяне на ново оригинално творчество. Тези които изучават живота обикновено говорят само за инволюция и еволюция, тези които изучават формата, а именно представителите на съвременната наука, се занимават само с еволюция, но най- напредналите измежду тях вече започват да откриват и друг фактор, който те наричат епигенезис. Още през 1757 година, Caspar Wolff издаде неговата ‘’Theorea Generationis’’, в която той показва че в развитието на яйцето има серия нови образувания, не заложени в началото, и Haeckel, признавайки този труд, казва че понастоящем вече не би трябвало да наричаме епигенезиса само идея. Защото е факт, който можем да демонстрираме използвайки микроскоп при по-нисшите форми където промените се извършват достатъчно бързо. Откакто умът е даден на човек, този изначален творчески импулс – епигенезисът е, който е бил причината за цялото ни развитие. Наистина, ние градим на базата на това което вече е сътворено, но винаги се появява и нещо ново вследствие на дейността на духа, и поради това ние ставаме творци, защото ако само копирахме това което е вече създадено за нас от Бог или Ангел, никога не би било възможно да станем творчески (създаващи) интелигенции; ние просто бихме били само имитатори. И въпреки че правим грешки, би могло да се каже, че ние често се учим много повече от нашите грешки отколкото от нашите успехи. Грехът и мъката, за които задаващият въпроса споменава, са в повечето случаи резултат от грешките които правим и тяхното щампосване (дълбоко отпечатване) върху нашето съзнание ни принуждава да прилагаме усилията си в други направления, които се проявяват като ‘’добри’’ – с други думи, които са в хармония с природата. Поради това, този свят е тренировъчно училище, а не долина на скръб и сълзи, в която сме били поставени от капризен Бог. (виж въпрос No.9) 

### <h3 id="question-2">ВЪПРОС No.2</h3>

Ако ‘’Бог е създал хората малко по-долу от Ангелите’’, как е възможно хората накрая да ги превъзхождат в Духовния Свят? 

Отговор: Въпросът издава известно неразбиране, от страна на задаващия въпроса. В ученията на Розенкройцерите никога не е имало подобно твърдение, но нещо все пак е казано засягащо този въпрос, което може би е погрешно разбрано. Същността на предмета е, че еволюцията се движи по спирала и никога няма повторение на същото състояние. Ангелите са по-ранен поток на еволюция, те са били хора през предишната инкарнация на земята, наречена от Розенкройцерите Лунен Период. Архангелите са били човечеството на Слънчевия Период и Боговете на Ума ( mind на български може да се преведе като ум, но и като съзнание), наречени от Павел ‘’Силите на тъмнината’’ са били човечеството на тъмния Сатурнов Период. Ние сме човечеството на четвъртия период от сегашната схема на проявление, Земният Период. Тъй като всички създания във вселената се развиват прогресиращо, хората от предишните периоди също са напреднали, така че сега те са на по-високо ниво отколкото са били когато са били хора – те са супер-хора. Затова напълно вярно е, че Бог е създал човек на малко по-ниско ниво от Ангелите. Но понеже всичко се развива и напредва по спирален път, вярно е също така, че сегашното наше човечество е по-високо еволюирало човечество отколкото Ангелите когато те са били хора; и че Ангелите са били по-високо развито човечество от Архангелите когато те са били хора. На следващата стъпка ние ще достигнем нещо подобно на нивото на Ангелите в настоящо време, но ние ще превъзхождаме това което са те сега. 

### <h3 id="question-3">ВЪПРОС No.3</h3>

Защо трябва да е необходимо за нас да преминем през това физическо съществуване? Не бихме ли могли да научим същите уроци без да бъдем затворени и ограничени от плътните условия на материалния свят? 

Отговор: Първоначално Новия Завет е бил написан на гръцки език и думата Logos има две значения: дума и мисъл която предхожда думата, така че когато Йоан ни казва в първа глава на неговото евангелие, че ‘’В началото беше Словото, и Словото беше у Бога, и Бог беше Словото’’, ние бихме могли да преведем този ред и по следния начин: В началото беше мисълта, и Словото беше у Бога, и Бог беше Словото. Всичко съществува по силата на този факт (словото). Това е ‘’живот’’. 

Всичко което съществува във вселената е било първо мисъл. Тази мисъл след това се проявява като дума, един звук който изгражда всички форми и самият той проявен като живот е вътре в тези форми. Това е процеса на сътворението, и човек, който е бил създаден по подобие на Бога, твори по същия начин, до известна степен. Той има способността да мисли; той може да изговаря мислите си и по този начин, тъй като не е в състояние да реализира до края идеите си сам, може да си осигури помощта на другите. Но ще дойде времето когато той ще създава директно с изречената от устните си дума, затова той сега учи да създава по друг начин, така че когато в бъдеще той стане способен да използва словото си за да създава директно, той ще знае как. Този тренинг е абсолютно необходим. Сега той би правил много грешки. Освен това, той още не е добър – той би създавал демонични същества. 

В зората на своето съществуване, когато човек е започнал да полага усилия за своето развитие, той е използвал веществата в твърдо агрегатно състояние, твърдите тела, силата на мускулите е била единствения начин да извършва работа, а от камък и кости, които той е събирал, е изработвал първите си груби инструменти с които можел да си служи. След това настанало времето когато в първобитното си жилище той за първи път е започнал да се доверява на водата; течностите, и водното колело е било първия механизъм. А течността вече притежава много по-голяма сила от твърдите материали. Една вълна би разрушила палубите на кораб, би изтръгнала мачтите и огънала най-здравия стоманен стълб все едно че е тънка жица; но силата на водата е стационарна сила и поради това е ограничена да действа там където се намира. Когато човек се е научил да използва силата на още по-ефирната материя която наричаме въздух, за него е станало възможно да задейства вятърни мелници навсякъде, които да вършат неговата работа и да използва платноходи, осъществявайки посредством тях връзка с целия свят. Така, следващата стъпка на човек по пътя на неговото развитие, е била постигната чрез използването на силата на материя още по-ефирна от водата и с по-универсално приложение отколкото това вещество. Но вятърът е променлив и на него не може да се разчита; поради това напредъкът на човешката цивилизация постигнат чрез използването му достигнал предел когато човек открил как да прилага още по-ефирния газ, парата, защото тя може да се получи навсякъде и по всяко време и напредъкът на света след това събитие е значителен. Има обаче едно ограничение при прилагането й защото силата на парата изисква тежки и обемисти съоръжения за пренасянето и’. Това ограничение практически е елиминирано при използването на една още по-фина сила, по-лесно преносима, електричеството, което е напълно невидимо и неосезаемо. 

Така, виждаме че прогресът на човек в миналото е зависил от усвояването на сили с нарастваща степен на отдалечаване от твърдата материя, всяка следваща в скалата с все по-голяма способност за трансмисия от предхождащата я и ние лесно разбираме че по-нататъчният прогрес зависи от откриването на още по- ефирни сили с по-висока способност за трансмисия. Ние знаем, че това което се нарича безжична телеграфия се осъществява дори без използването на проводници, но дори тази система не е идеална, защото зависи от енергия генерирана в централна станция, която е стационарна.Това изисква употребата на скъпи съоръжения и затова е недостъпно за мнозинството (‘’от мен - какъв огромен напредък е постигнало човечеството в това направление за 100 години след като е била написана тази книга’’).Идеалната сила би била силата която човек би могъл да генерира от себе си във всеки момент без използването на техника. 

Преди няколко десетилетия Жул Верн ни доставяше удоволствие като рисуваше пред нашето въображение образите на подводница, пътешествие около земята за осемдесет дни и т.н.Днес картините които той изобразяваше са факт, изпреварвайки дори неговото въображение и ще дойде ден когато ние ще имаме на разположение генераторът на енергия, за който разказвахме по-горе. Bulwer Lytton неговия труд ‘’Идващата раса’’ е описал сила наречена ‘’Vril’’ , която е притежавана от въображаеми същества и която те могат да използват за да се движат над земята във въздуха и по различни други начини. Такава сила има латентна във всеки един от нас, понякога говорим за нея като за емоция. Ние чувстваме нейната понякога ескалираща мощ като ярост когато се развихри и казваме ‘’човекът е загубил контрол над себе си’’. Никакъв обем от работа не може така да измори физическото тяло и да го омаломощи както когато огромно количество енергия е изпуснато на свобода от тялото на желанията в пристъп на ярост. Обикновено, в днешно време, тази огромна сила спи и това е добре и така трябва да бъде докато ние не сме се научили да я използваме в съответствие с мисълта, която е още по-фина сила. Този свят е училище което да ни научи как да чувстваме и мислим правилно, така че да можем да се подготвим да използваме тези две висши сили – силата на емоцията и силата на мисълта. 

Един пример ще направи по-разбираемо как този свят изпълнява това предназначение. Откривател има нова идея. Идеята още не е мисъл, тя е само като проблясък и още не е придобила форма, но постоянно той си я представя изградена от вещество(материя) на ума. Той оформя в мислите си една машина и пред неговото умствено зрение този механизъм се появява с неговите валове въртящи се по някакъв начин, с цел да се изпълни желаната функция. След това той започва да чертае планове за този механизъм и дори на този етап на конкретизация много е вероятно да се разбере, че са необходими модификации. По такъв начин, разбираме че физическите условия показват на изобретателя къде неговата мисъл е била погрешна. Когато той построи механизма от подходящ материал, така че да изпълнява желаната функция, ще се разбере че е необходимо да бъдат направени още промени. Може би ще се наложи да се изостави първия вариант, да се обнови изцяло концепцията и да се построи нов механизъм. По този начин конкретните физически условия са му позволили да открие недостатъците в неговите разсъждения; те са го накарали да направи необходимите промени в първоначалната му мисъл за да се появи машината която ще изпълнява желаната функция. Ако го имаше само Света на Мисълта, той не би разбрал че е допуснал грешка, но втвърдените солидни физически условия му показват къде неговата мисъл е била погрешна. 

Физическият Свят учи откривателя да мисли правилно и неговите успешни машини са превъплътените верни мисли. 

Същият принцип важи и за политическите, комерсиалните и обществените области. Ако нашите идеи за различни области на живота са погрешни, те се коригират когато придобиват т.н. практическо приложение и затова този свят е абсолютна необходимост за да ни учи как да си служим със силата на мисълта и със силата на желанието, сега тези сили са възпирани от всеобхватно приложение от нашето материално обкръжение. Но, тъй като времето се движи напред и ние се научаваме как да мислим правилно все повече и повече, на края ще бъдем в състояние да мислим правилно на секундата във всеки случай без да има нужда да експериментираме и тогава ние, също така, ще бъдем в състояние да изричаме нашата мисъл в действително създание, като същество. Имало е такова време много много отдавна когато човекът е бил духовно същество и когато условията на земята са били по-пластични. Тогава той е бил обучаван директно от Боговете да използва думата като способ за създаване и той е работил с този способ върху животните и растенията. В Библията пише, че Бог е дал животните на човека и той им е дал имена. Това даване на имена не е било просто да нарече лъва лъв, а е било формиращ процес който е давал власт на човек над съществото което той е именувал и само себичността и необузданата жестокост са го направили негоден да бъде владетел на силата на изреченото от майсторите слово, изгубена за него. Когато святостта отново ще заеме мястото на отричането от Бога, словото ще бъде намерено отново и ще бъде създаващата сила на божественото човечество в една бъдеща епоха. 

### <h3 id="question-4">ВЪПРОС No.4</h3>

Ако този земен живот е толкова важен и наистина основа за целия душевен растеж, който се получава по-късно в резултат на опита натрупан тук, защо нашият земен живот е толкова кратък в сравнение с живота във висшите светове който достига приблизително хиляда години между два земни живота. 

Отговор: Всичко това, което е направено от човешката ръка на този свят, е изкристализирала мисъл; столовете на които седим, къщите в които живеем, различните удобства като телефона, парахода, локомотива и т.н. са били някога мисъл в ума на човека. Ако я нямаше тази мисъл, предметът никога не би се появил. По подобен начин дърветата, цветята, планините и моретата са изкристализирали мисловни форми на природните сили. Човек, след като напусне това тяло след смъртта и встъпи във Второто Небе, става едно цяло с тези природни сили; той работи под ръководството на креативни йерархии, създавайки за себе си околната среда която е нужна за следващата стъпка в развитието му. Там той строи от ‘’умствена материя’’ (‘’умствено вещество’’) архетипите на сушата и моретата; той работи с флората и фауната; той създава всичко в неговата околна среда като мисъл-форми и тъй както той промени условията за живот, така те се проявяват когато той се прероди. 

Но изработването на неща в мисловна форма е много по-различен процес отколкото изработването на неща в твърда форма. Понастоящем ние сме много слаби мислители и затова ни е необходимо изключително много време за да построим мисъл-формите във Второто Небе; след това ние трябва да изчакаме съответното време след което тези форми ще изкристализират в действителната плътна околна среда на физическия свят в който трябва да се върнем. Затова е необходимо да пребиваваме в Небесния Свят много по-дълго време отколкото оставаме в земния живот. Когато сме се научили да мислим правилно, ние ще бъдем в състояние да създаваме тук във Физическия Свят за много по-кратко време отколкото сега ни отнема. Също така не ще бъде необходимо да прекарваме толкова дълго извън земен живот, както сега. 

### <h3 id="question-5">ВЪПРОС No.5</h3>

Колко време трябва да мине преди да можем да съществуваме без тези физически тела и отново да действаме заедно в Духовните Светове? 

Отговор: Този въпрос разкрива начин на мислене който се среща често сред хората които са се запознали с факта, че ние притежаваме духовни тела в които можем да се движим през пространството със скоростта на светлината, тела на които не им е необходима материална одежда и затова техните притежатели са освободени от грижата за едно физическо тяло. Тези хора копнеят за времето когато на тях ще им израстат криле и те ще могат да се отърват от тази ‘’низка отвратителна смъртна обвивка’’. 

Много жалко е да се мисли така. Ние би трябвало да сме много благодарни за материалния инструмент който притежаваме, защото той е най-ценен от всичките ни тела-носители. Наистина е съвършено вярно, че нашето физическо тяло е най- нисше от всички наши носители, но също така факт е, че този носител е в най- голяма степен завършен и без него другите носители биха били понастоящем от малка полза за нас. Защото докато този великолепно организиран инструмент ни дава възможност да се справяме с хиляди различни условия тук, нашите по- висши носители са практически неорганизирани. Виталното тяло е формирано орган по орган спрямо нашето плътно тяло, но докато не e тренирано посредством езотерически упражнения то не е годен да функционира самостоятелно инструмент. Тялото на желанията има само известен брой сетивни центрове, които обаче дори не са активирани в болшинството от хората, а колкото до ума, той е един безформен облак при повечето хора. В днешно време ние трябва да се стремим да одухотворяваме физическото тяло и би трябвало да разберем, че е нужно да тренираме нашите по-висши носители преди да можем да си служим с тях. За мнозинството от хората това ще отнеме дълго, дълго време. Поради това, най-добре ще е да си изпълняваме дълга и да си вършим всекидневната работа, вместо да бързаме към деня когато ще бъдем в състояние да използваме по-висшите тела-носители, защото този ден зависи от нас самите. 

### <h3 id="question-6">ВЪПРОС No.6</h3>

Дали духът влиза в тялото по време на зачеването или по време на раждането? 

Отговор: Посредством ясновидско проучване е било установено, че при настъпването на смъртта духът взима със себе си силите или енергията на една малка частица (атом*) намираща се в лявата камера на сърцето, която се нарича семенен атом, защото тя е сърцевината или семето около което се събира материята на всички съставни части в тялото и всяка частица в тялото трябва да е в състояние да вибрира в унисон с този семенен атом. Затова този атом е вложен в сперматозоид на бащата известно време преди зачатието и по-късно навлиза в утробата на майката. Но зачеването съвсем не е едно и също нещо със сексуалното единение на родителите. Оплодителният сперматозоид понякога не e проникнал в яйцеклетката четиринадесет дни след единението на родителите. Оплождането на яйцеклетката може да се нарече зачеване, защото от момента когато оплодената яйцеклетка напусне фалопиевата тръба, започва периодът на вътреутробното развитие (gestation). През първите осемнадесет до двадесет и един дни цялата работа извършва майката, но след този период от време прераждащият се Его, облечен в облак от вещество на желанията и ума (материя от Световете на Желанията и Ума) с форма на камбана, влиза в утробата на майката и камбановидният облак се затваря в долната си част по такъв начин, че придобива формата на яйце. Тогава духът определено е уловен като в мрежа в плътта и не може вече да се измъкне и трябва да остане с майката докато се освободи след раждането. На сегашното ниво от нашето развитие, духът извършва много малка част от работата по строежа на неговото бъдещо тяло съзнателно, но е там през цялото време и помага несъзнателно при изграждането на неговия инструмент. Това не е по-странно от факта, че ние сме в състояние да смиламе храната си и да управляваме дихателната си система без да участваме съзнателно в тези процеси.

Каква е била причината за разделянето на половете? 

Отговор: Разделянето на половете е станало на много ранен етап от човешката еволюция, когато човекът не е имал, както сега, мозък и ларинкс. Тогава половината от силата за създаване на потомство е била отклонена нагоре за да могат да бъдат изградени тези два органа. Мозъкът е бил построен за развитие и растеж на мисълта в следствие на което човек създава във физическия свят. Къщи, градове, параходи, железници, всичко направено от ръката е изкристализирала човешка мисъл. Също така ларинкса е бил създаден от творческата сексуална сила за да може човек да изразява своите мисли. Връзката между тези органи и силата на половия орган ще стане очевидна когато обърнем внимание на това как момчето, което притежава положителна (или активна) сила за създаване, си променя гласа по време на пубертета когато за първи път става способно да пресъздава своя вид; също мъжът който злоупотребява със сексуалната си сила понижава способността си за мислена, докато задълбоченият мислител който използва почти цялата си сила за създаване за творчество има малка или почти никаква наклонност към сексуален живот. 

Преди да се извърши това разделяне човек е приличал на някои сегашни растения, създаващ субект способен сам да размножава рода си без помощта на друг. Способностите за мисъл и говор са дадени след загубата на тази креативна мощ; но сега тази половина от силата за създаване, която се проявява чрез мозъка и ларинкса, може да бъда използвана за създаване на обекти в света – къщи, кораби и т.н.

Дали душата на жената е от мъжки род, а душата на мъжа от женски род? 

Отговор: В общи линии бихме могли да кажем ‘’да’’, виталното тяло което в бъдеще ще бъде трансформирано, трансмутирано и одухотворено (спиритуализирано) в душа е от противния пол. То е формирано орган по орган като физическото тяло с това само изключение и това обяснява много факти, които иначе не биха могли да бъдат обяснени. Качествата присъщи на виталното тяло са растеж, размножаване, асимилация (храносмилане) и памет. Жената, имайки положително (активно) витално тяло, узрява по-рано от мъжа, частите на тялото които остават ‘’подобни на растение’’, като косата например, която пораства по-дълга и по-красива; и естествено едно положително витално тяло ще произведе повече кръв отколкото отрицателното пасивно витално тяло притежавано от мъжа, в следствие на което у жената има по-голямо налягане на кръвта което трябва на се разтоварва чрез периодично кръвотечение и когато това се преустанови, в климактериума, при жената се появява второ израстване, добре формулирано чрез израза ‘’напълняване на четиридесет’’. 

Импулсите на тялото на желанията движат кръвта в организма с различна скорост в съответствие със силата на емоциите. Организмът на жената, която има излишък от кръв, работи под много по-голямо напрежение отколкото организмът на мъжа, това напрежение се разтоварва чрез периодични кръвотечения, но има моменти когато е нужен допълнителен отдушник; тогава сълзите ‘’бялото кървене’’ действат като предпазна клапа за отстраняване на излишната течност. Мъжете, въпреки че и те могат да имат също толкова силни емоции, не използват често сълзите защото те не притежават повече кръв отколкото биха могли комфортно да използват. 

Бидейки положително заредена в Етерната Област на Физическия Свят, сферата на действие на жената е била дома и църквата, където тя е обкръжена с любов и спокойствие, докато мъжът е водил битката на силните за оцеляване на по- приспособените в плътния Физически Свят, където той е положителен.

Дали ние запазваме един и същ характер през всичките си животи? 

Отговор: Его може да се оприличи на скъпоценен камък, на необработен диамант. Когато диаманта е изваден от земята, той е твърде далеч от истинската си красота; грубата обвивка скрива вътрешното великолепие и преди суровият диамант да се превърне в скъпоценен камък той трябва да бъде шлифован с твърд инструмент. Всяко действие с този инструмент отстранява част от грубата обвивка и изрязва една страна на диаманта през която навлиза светлината и се пречупва на ъгъл различен от тези ъгли, на които се пречупват отразените обратно от другите стени на диаманта светлинни лъчи. 

Така е и с Его. Необработен диамант, той навлиза в училището за жизнен опит, странник през материята, и всеки живот е като едно докосване на шлифовъчния инструмент до камъка. Всеки живот в училището за опитност отстранява част от грапавината на Его и допуска светлината на интелигентността да се пречупи на нов ъгъл, давайки различна опитност, така че както ъглите на пречупване на светлината от различните стени на диаманта варират, така и темперамента на Его се променя през всеки живот. През всеки живот ние можем да изградим само малка част от нашата духовна природа, ние можем да реализираме само малка част от великолепието на нашите божествени възможности, но тенденцията е всеки следващ живот да ни полира все повече и повече и нашият темперамент да става все по-спокоен. Всъщност, работата върху нашия темперамент е главната част от урока, защото целта е да станем господари на самите нас. Както Гьоте казва: 

```
‘’От всяка сила, която владее целия свят,   
Човек се освобождава когато придобие себе-контрол.’’

Дали тялото на желанията се разболява и дали то има нужда от храна и обновяване? 

Отговор: В известен смисъл може да се каже, че през време на земния живот болестите се проявяват първо в тялото на желанията и във виталното тяло, като тъканта им изтънява и жизненият (виталният) флуид не протича така както когато човек е здрав. След това плътното физическо тяло се разболява. Когато настъпи възстановяване, по-висшите тела показват подобрение преди да се забележи оздравяване във физическия свят. 

Но, ако питащият има предвид условията след смъртта, нещата са различни. Въпреки че някой човек може да бъде болен тук, може би прикован на легло в продължение на години и да не бъде в състояние да се движи, след като е настъпила смъртта и той се усети без физическо тяло, тогава изведнъж настъпва чувство на облекчение, чувство на радост и лекота което за него е необичайно и той изведнъж осъзнава че няма болка и че е в състояние да се движи. Ако той разбира условията там, той също ще знае, че не е нужно да се храни защото тялото на желанията не изисква обновяване. Много хора, обаче, не разбират този факт и затова откриваме в по-горните области на света на желанията, че понякога те искат да вършат всичко което се прави при обикновеното домакинстване. Това разкриват историите описани от някои спиритуалисти проучвали Невидимия Свят; това важи в голяма степен и за разказа на George du Maurier за живота на Peter Ibbetson и Conntess of Towers в неговата творба, запазвайки името на героя. Тази книга е за препоръчване на читателя защото дава хубава илюстрация за действието на паметта на свръх съзнанието посредством която героят се занимава с живота през детството си и за действителните условия в по-ниските области на Невидимия Свят, които са основа за неговите и на контесата преживявания. 

### <h3 id="question-11">ВЪПРОС No.11</h3>

Как става така, че някой изкупва всичките си грехове в Чистилището, но после след прераждането си трябва отново да страда, поради Закона за Причинно- следствената връзка за греховете си от предишния живот? 

Отговор: Има две различни дейности в Чистилището. Първо, има изчистване на лошите наклонности (навици). Например, алкохоликът има същото силно желание за питие както и преди смъртта, но сега той няма стомах и хранопровод където да поеме алкохола, така че въпреки че той може да пребивава в различни кръчми и въпреки че той може дори да се вмъкне и да се накисне в бъчва за уиски и да се напои там с алкохол, той не получава удоволствие защото алкохолът не може да се разгради химически, както това става в стомаха. Така той изстрадва цялата си мъка на Tantalus - ‘’Вода, вода навсякъде, но нито една капка за пиене…’’ 

Но, тъй както в този свят желанието прегаря когато разберем че не може да се изпълни, така пияницата бива излекуван от влечението си към пиенето, защото не може да поеме никакъв алкохол, и той се ражда невинен пречистен от злото, доколкото се отнася да този порок. Обаче, той трябва да преодолее този порок съзнателно, така че някога на неговия път ще се появи изкушението. Когато той е станал зрял човек, някой приятел може да го помоли ‘’да дойде и да се почерпят с по едно питие’’. Тогава, зависи от решението му дали той ще откаже или не. Ако се съгласи, той ще сгреши отново и отново ще трябва да бъде пречистен, докато най-накрая натрупаната болка от повторенията в чистилищните съществувания не предизвика у него отвращение към пиенето. Тогава той съзнателно ще е преодолял изкушението и няма да има повече страдания от този източник. 

Колкото до злото което сме причинили на другите, например ако сме се отнасяли жестоко към дете което е било поверено на нашите грижи, като сме го били или сме го оставяли да гладува или по някакъв друг начин сме го малтретирали, сцените когато сме вършили това зло ще се отпечатат върху атома в сърцето; по- късно отпечатъкът ще бъде презаписан върху тялото на желанията и панорамата на живота, която се разгръща назад в обратен ред, ще представи отново тези сцени пред нашето съзнание. Тогава ние самите ще почувстваме това което е чувствало детето като наша жертва; ние ще усещаме нараняванията от ударите които сме нанасяли точно както детето ги е усещало, ние ще чувстваме душевната мъка и унижението, ние ще чувстваме ужасните болка след болка, и след това след като се преродим, ние ще срещнем нашата жертва и ще имаме възможността да сторим добро на този човек, не зло. Ако направим така, много хубаво. Ако нашата враждебност настоятелно се прояви отново, тогава други удари в следващото Чистилище ще ни накарат най-накрая да разберем, че трябва да бъдем милостиви към тези за които се грижим. Така че, ние не страдаме отново за грехове от предишния живот, ние сме родени невинни благодарение на благословеното съдействие на Чистилището, и в края на краищата всеки акт на жестокост който извършваме е акт на свободната ни воля. Но пред нас се поставят изкушения с цел да се докажем, че пречистването е било достатъчно за да ни научи на необходимите уроци и наша привилегия е да решим – или да се отклоним или да стоим твърдо на страната на доброто.

Дали съвестта е глас на Бога или на нашия Ангел Хранител? 

Отговор: Когато духът напуска тялото при смъртта, панорамата на неговия изминал живот преминава пред него по време на първите три и половина дни след като се е освободил от тялото. Тези картини се щамповат върху тялото на желанията и формират основата на живота в Чистилището и на Първото небе, които се намират в Света на Желанията. Миналият живот се репродуцира в картини движейки се назад, така че сцените които са се случили точно преди смъртта преминават първи; след това следва животът в направление към детството и най-ранното детство. В Чистилището се привеждат в действие само сцените в които душата е вършила зло и тя се вижда в образа на хората към които е било насочено злото и страда както те са страдали от това зло през земния живот. Този запис е неизличимо гравиран* върху семенния атом, който е единствената част от твърдото тяло който душата взима със себе си и запазва постоянно живот след живот. Това е, нещо като ‘’дневник’’ на ‘’Записващия Ангел’’ и тъй като страданието причинено от определено действие е било запомнено върху този семенен атом в Чистилището, очевидно е, че когато през новия живот възникнат подобни обстоятелства и старите изкушения се появят пред нас, страданията които сме изпитали заради това неправилно деяние са записани в семенния атом за да ни предупредят, че такъв начин на действие е погрешен. Това е ‘’гласът на съвестта’’*, и ако завещаното страдание в Чистилището е било достатъчно интензивно, ние ще имаме силата да се противопоставим на всяко появило се пред нас изкушение. Ако, от друга страна, поради различни причини страданието не е било достатъчно, ние може да се предадем за винаги или временно през друг живот на същото изкушение което е предизвикало страдание в предишен живот; ние може да не се вслушаме в тихото шептене на съвестта. Но когато ще сме освободени от нашите тела и преминем в Чистилището следващия път, там тогава ще си причиним добавъчно страдание предизвикано от поддаването ни на изкушението и натрупаният ефект от страданието ще бъде най-накрая достатъчен за да ни възпре от начина на действие предизвикващ болката. 

() - гравиран* - ‘’engraven’’ гравиран, врязан, отпечатан или запомнен в информационния носител наречен семенен атом (вид памет).   

() - съвест* – коренът на българската дума ‘’съвест’’ е ’’ вест’’ (от отвъдното).   

Когато изкушението се е появило пред нас през един земен живот и е било отстранено съзнателно, тогава сме научили урока и съвестта е изпълнила предназначението си. 

Отговаряйки точно на въпроса можем, поради това да кажем, че съвестта е паметта на духа за минали страдания предизвикани от грешки в предишни животи. 

### <h3 id="question-13">ВЪПРОС No.13</h3>

Какво е гений?

Отговор: От гледна точка на популярното схващане, гениалността изглежда като случайност. Теорията за наследствеността не важи в този случай, защото понякога най-обикновени хора имат дете гений, а най-високо образовани интелектуалци имат умствено недоразвити деца. Понякога в едно и също семейство могат да се срещнат деца с вродено слабоумие и гении. Всъщност, лудост и гениалност, може да се каже, че са двете екстремности където се срещат умствените способности на човек. 

Ако се мъчим да си обясним гениалността посредством наследствеността, непрекъснато си задаваме въпроса защо няма дълга верига от прадеди-механици преди Томас Едисон, който тогава би бил завършек на фамилията. Ние откриваме във всички случаи, че появата на гений не е подвластна на никакъв закон, погледнато просто от материална гледна точка. 

Ако обаче, разглеждайки този проблем, се обърнем към закона за причинността и придружаващия го закон за прераждането нещата са много по-различни. Тази теория твърди, че животът на земята е училище за натрупване на опит, че при всяко ново раждане ние идваме с натрупана опитност от всички предишни животи като наш складиран запас, наш капитал; че някои от нас са посещавали това училище за жизнен опит през много на брой животи и са натрупали голям запас. Може би сме развили едно определено качество повече, така че сме станали изключителен експерт в дадена специална област от нашето развитие. Това е гениалност. 

С цел да бъде изразена някоя от нашите способност, например музикалност, необходимо е да имаме определени физически характеристики, като дълги и фини пръсти, деликатна нервна система и в частност, ухото трябва да е изградено по специален начин за да можем да се изявим като музиканти. Необходимият материал (или материя) за тази изява не може да се намери навсякъде, затова законът за асоциацията естествено би привлякъл един музикант към други музиканти и там той би намерил подходящ материал за да си построи тяло в съответствие с изискванията за изразяване на неговия талант. Затова, понякога изглежда, че музиканти се раждат в една и съща семейна верига; например двадесет и девет музиканти са били родени във фамилията на Бах в продължение на двеста и петдесет години. 

### <h3 id="question-14">ВЪПРОС No.14</h3>

Дали една душа, която е родена като жена е винаги жена в следващите си животи и никога ли не може да стане мъж? И каква е продължителността на времето между инкарнациите? 

Отговор: Не, духът е двуполов и обикновено в последователни животи се ражда редуващо се като мъж и жена. Обаче понякога има случаи когато съобразно Закона за Причинно-следствената връзка за предпочитане е духът да се преражда няколко пъти последователно в човек от един и същ пол. 

Закономерността е следната: 

Понеже слънцето се движи в обратна посока преминавайки през дванадесетте съзвездия с движение което се нарича прецесия на равноденствието, климатът на земята, флората и фауната се променят бавно; по този начин във всяка следваща епоха създават различна околна среда за човешката раса. На слънцето му е необходимо време от около две хиляди години за да премине през един знак от зодиака, при прецесията, и през това време духът обикновено се ражда два пъти, един път като мъж и един път като жена. Промените които се осъществяват за хиляда години между две инкарнации не са така големи, но духът ще е в състояние да извлече опитност от тази околна среда от позицията на двата пола, на мъж и на жена. 

Обаче, понякога се срещат случаи когато и продължителността на времето също варира. Никоя от тази закономерности не е константа, те се управляват от Велики Интелигенции в полза на човечеството, така че условията могат да бъдат променени с цел да се нагодят към неотложни изисквания на индивидуални случаи. Например, в случай на музикант. Той не може да намери материал за строежа на неговото тяло навсякъде. Той се нуждае от определена помощ за построяването на трите овални каналчета в ухото по такъв начин, че те да са насочени възможно най-точно към трите посоки на пространството; той също така се нуждае от специална помощ за строежа на нежните фибри на Корти, тъй като неговата способност да различава нюанси в музикалните тонове зависи от тези фибри. 

В такъв случай, ако семейството от музиканти, с които той има връзка е в позицията да роди дете, той може да бъде изпратен там въпреки че престоят му в Небесния Свят не би трябвало нормално да се прекрати през следващите сто години, но може би няма да се появи друга такава възможност двеста или триста години след като той би се родил, ако се спази закономерността. Този човек, разбира се, ще бъде пред своето време и няма да може да бъде оценен от генерацията сред която живее. Той е неразбран, но това е по-добре отколкото да бъде роден по-късно, от колкото би трябвало, защото тогава той би бил изостанал от своето време. 

Затова толкова често откриваме гении недооценени от техните съвременници, но високо ценени от следващите поколения които могат да разберат техния мироглед. 

### <h3 id="question-15">ВЪПРОС No.15</h3>

Когато човек си плаща дълговете, грижи се за семейството си и води морален живот тук, не би ли трябвало той да бъде добре и в отвъдното? 

Отговор: Не, изисква се нещо повече и има много хора с такова убеждение които прекарват по-скоро незавидно времето си в Света на Желанията след смъртта. Те са добри, разбира се, но погледнато само от позицията на този живот, но в днешно време от нас се изисква да култивираме поне някакви алтруистически тенденции с цел да прогресираме отвъд нашия сегашен еволюционен статус. 

Ние намираме хората които са занемарили своите по-висши задължения в четвъртата област на Света на Желанията след смъртта. Тук е човекът от бизнеса, който се е грижил за всеки долар, който се е отнасял честно с всички; който като добър гражданин е работил за материалното благосъстояние на своите град и родина като е плащал на своите работници заслуженото, отнасял се е към своята съпруга и семейството си с внимание, осигурявал им е всички възможни блага и т.н. Той може би е построил църква или поне е бил много щедър към нея; или може би е построил библиотека или е основал благотворителна институция и т.н. Но той не е дал себе си. Той само е бил заинтересуван от църквата заради семейството си или за да бъде почтен; той не е вложил сърцето си в това, цялото му сърце е било в работата, в правенето на пари или за постигането на светски почести. 

Когато той встъпва в Света на Желанията след смъртта си, той е твърде добър за да отиде в Чистилището и недостатъчно добър за да отиде на небето. Той се е отнасял справедливо с всички и не е ощетил никого. Затова няма какво да изчиства. Но, пък той не е сторил и нищо добро, което би му осигурило живот на Първо Небе където се асимилира доброто от изминалия живот. Поради това, той е в четвъртия регион – между Рая и Ада, както се приема. Четвъртия Регион е център на Света на Желанията и чувството там е най-интензивно; човекът все още чувства силно желание за бизнес, но там той нито може да купува, нито може да продава, и така животът му е монотонен по възможно най-ужасния начин. 

Всичко което е дал на църквите, институциите и т.н. няма стойност тук поради липса на отдадено сърце. Само когато даваме от любов, дарението е валидно за да ни донесе щастие в отвъдното. Не е важно колко даваме, от значение е само душевността която придружава дарението; затова в силите и възможностите на всеки е да даде и по този начин да облагодетелства себе си и другите. Безразборното даряване на пари, обаче, често прави хората разточителни и накрая самите те да станат нуждаещи се, от друга страна, оказвайки съчувствие от сърце, помагайки на хората да повярват в себе си и да започнат отново живота си след като са пропаднали отклонявайки се от правия път; отплащайки се чрез служене на хората, ние натрупваме съкровище на Небето и даваме повече от злато. ‘’Бедните са винаги с нас’’. Ние може би не сме в състояние да ги измъкнем от нищетата и да ги направим богати и това може би не е най-доброто за тях, но ние можем да ги окуражим да научат урока който трябва да бъде научен в бедността; ние можем да им помогнем за по-оптимистичен поглед към живота. И ако човекът, който питащият има пред вид задавайки въпроса, не прави всичко това той няма да бъде ‘’добре’’ когато си отиде от този свят, той ще страда от това ужасно еднообразие за да се научи че трябва да изпълва живота си с нещо което има истинска стойност; и така в последващия живот неговата съвест ще му шепне да върши нещо по-добро от трупане на пари, въпреки че той не бива да занемарява и материалните си задължения, защото това е също толкова лошо както и да се отказва и от духовните си стремежи. 

### <h3 id="question-16">ВЪПРОС No.16</h3>

Понякога се твърди, че имаме право да мислим каквото искаме и че не носим отговорност за нашите мисли. Така ли е от окултна гледна точка? 

Отговор: Не, наистина; точно обратното е и не е необходимо да се обръщаме към тъй наречения окултизъм, тази идея е дадена от Христос в проповед в която той ни казва: ‘’Мъжът който е погледнал жена с желание, наистина, вече е извършил прелюбодеяние’’. Бихме имали много по-семпла концепция за живота, ако взимахме под внимание само действията на хората, защото всяко действие е резултат от предхождаща го мисъл, обаче тези мисли не винаги са наши собствени. 

Ако ударим камертон, друг камертон от същия тон, ако се намира достатъчно близо, ще започне да звучи заедно с ударения. По подобен начин, ако ние мислим за нещо и друг човек близо до нас мисли за нещо подобно, нашите мисли се съединяват с неговите и го подкрепят за добро или за лошо в зависимост от естеството на мислите. Не е просто фантазия, когато в играта ‘’Часът на магьосничествата’’ героят се мъчи да помогне на престъпника да избяга от Кентъки, където по-късно би трябвало да бъде арестуван за убийство на губернатора. Героят, човек със значителна сила на мисълта, чувства че може би е подтикнал престъплението. Той казва на сестра си, че преди извършването на убийството то си помислил, че то би могло да стане точно по начина по който е било извършено в действителност. Той има впечатлението, че неговите мисли са били приети от мозъка на убиеца и са му подсказали начина на извършването на убийството. 

Ако е извършено някакво престъпление, ние знаем само действията на престъпника, ние нямаме понятие какви мисли са го подтикнали към това. Ако имаме привичка да мислим лошо за някого или за нещо, злите ни мисли може да са били привлечени към евентуален престъпник и по принципа на следното: ако имаме пред нас наситен солен разтвор, необходимо е да се добави само още едно кристалче за да се втвърди разтвора, така ако човек е наситил мозъка си с мисли за убийство, мисълта която ние сме изпратили би могла да бъде последната капка от която да прелее чашата, разрушавайки последната преграда която би задържала престъпника да не извърши деянието. 

Поради това нашите мисли имат много по-голямо значение отколкото нашите действия, защото ако винаги мислим правилно, винаги ще действаме правилно. Никой човек не може да мисли само с любов за хората около себе си, не може да си представя в мислите си как ще им помага духовно, умствено или физически без да реализира тези мисли в действие по някое време от живота си. И достатъчно е само да култивираме такива мисли за да се озовем скоро обгърнати от слънчева светлина; ние ще открием че хората ще ни приемат в същия този дух който излъчваме и, ако бихме могли да разберем че тялото на желанията (което обвива всички нас и се разпростира на 41 – 46 сантиметра извън периферията на физическото тяло) съдържа всички тези чувства и емоции, то ние бихме приемали хората по различен начин, защото бихме разбирали че всичко което виждаме минава през атмосферата (аурата) която сме си създали около нас и нейните цветове, всъщност, виждаме у другите. 

Ако виждаме низост и дребнавост у хората които срещаме, би било добре да си изясним дали това което виждаме не е атмосферата през която гледаме и която ги оцветява. Да видим дали не сме ние които притежаваме тези нежелани качества и да започнем да поправяме дефектите у себе си. Човек който е долен и низък излъчва тези качества и когото и да срещне, ще му изглежда долен и низък защото той ще изкарва наяве у другите качествата които той поддържа у себе си, на принципа според който вибрациите на камертон от даден тон ще предизвикат вибрации у друг камертон от същия тон. От друга страна, ако култивираме ведро и спокойно отношение към света и самочувствие, чуждо на много силни желания и искрено, открито и готово за помощ, ние ще изкараме наяве най-доброто от другите хора. Затова нека да разберем, че докато не култивираме у себе си по-добри качества, не може да очакваме че ще ги открием у другите. Затова сме наистина много отговорни за нашите мисли, ние настина сме пазители на нашите братя, защото каквото мислим когато общуваме с тях, така изглеждаме за тях, и те отразяват нашето отношение. Прилагайки горе описания принцип, ако искаме да получим помощ за да развием тези по-добри качества, нека да търсим обкръжението на хора които вече са добри, защото техният характер неминуемо ще подтикне култивирането на добри качества и у нас.

Ако някой е постоянно измъчван от зли мисли които непрекъснато се появяват в неговото съзнание, въпреки че постоянно се бори с тях, има ли някакъв начин той да изчисти ума си, така че да има само чисти и добри мисли? 

Отговор: Да има много лесен начин за това. Задаващият въпроса сам посочва най-голямата трудност в своя въпрос, когато казва, че той постоянно се бори с тези мисли. Ако разгледаме някакъв пример, същността на проблема ще се изясни. 

Да предположим, че изпитваме някаква антипатия и към някой човек, скарани сме с него и го срещаме всеки ден на улицата, може би дори по няколко пъти на ден. Ако се спираме всеки път когато срещнем този човек и му се караме, защото върви по същата улица по която вървим и ние, защото не вземе да се скрие от погледа ни, тогава всеки път наливаме масло в огъня на нашата неприязън, ние го дразним по този начин и от чиста злоба той може да започне нарочно да ни причаква. Двете, и симпатията и антипатията, притежават тенденцията да привличат дадена мисъл или идея към нас и добавената мисловна сила която излъчваме за да се борим с лошите мисли ще ги поддържа живи и още по-често ще ги поражда в съзнанието ни, по същия начин както кавгата ще накара човека който не харесваме да ни причаква нарочно на улицата. Но ако вместо да се борим с тях ние възприемем тактиката на безразличие, ако обърнем главата си на другата страна когато минаваме покрай него скоро на него ще му омръзне да ни преследва; принципът е следния: когато лоши мисли се пораждат в главата ни, ако се обърнем на другата страна с безразличие и си насочим съзнанието към нещо хубаво и добро, скоро ще открием че сме се отървали от тяхното присъствие и имаме само желаните добри мисли. 

### <h3 id="question-18">ВЪПРОС No.18</h3>

Ако жената еманация от мъжа, както е според историята за реброто, дали тя по време на крайното възвръщане към единение ще бъде отново абсорбирана от божеството от мъжки пол, изгубвайки индивидуалността си? 

Отговор: Историята за реброто е един от тези примери на голямата некомпетентност на някои от преводачите на Библията – които не са имали окултни знания – когато са боравели със старо-еврейски език, който в писмен вид не е разделен на думи и няма гласни букви. При вмъкването на гласни на различни места и разделяйки написаното на думи по различен начин, може да се получи текст с различен смисъл. Това е един от случаите – една и съща дума може да се чете като ‘’tsad’’ и като’’tsela’’ . Преводачите са прочели историята, в която Бог е взел нещо от Адам (‘’tsela’’), те са били озадачени какво е било то, може би те са помислили че най-малкото зло ще бъде ако използват думата ребро (‘’tsad’’), и в резултат се е получила глупавата история. 

Истината е, че човек първоначално е бил като Боговете ‘’направен по тяхно подобие’’, от мъжки и женски пол – хермафродит и по-късно едната част е била отнета*; и така той е бил разделен на два пола. По нататък може да се каже, че първият орган който е бил създаден в сегашния си вид е бил женският полов орган, женската част е съществувала във всичко преди мъжката, а в съответствие със закона на еволюцията който гласи че ‘’първото ще бъде последно’’, женският пол ще остане за по-дълго време да бъде отделен пол; и поради това, питащият греши в предположенията си. Мъжкият пол ще бъде абсорбиран от женския. Дори сега се вижда че този орган постепенно се свива в основата си и най-накрая ще изчезне. 

() - отнета* - Его не е бил разделен на две части – мъж и жена. Едната част е била ‘’отнета’’ и той е станал мъж или жена. 

() - От гледна точка на съвременните познания, едната част може да се приеме, че е единия клон от двойката хромозоми.

Колкото до загубването на индивидуалността, такова нещо е невъзможно; точно целта на еволюцията е ние да станем индивидуалности, себе-съзнателни** и отделни през еволюцията и себе-съзнателни и обединени през почивките между проявленията.

() - себе-съзнателни** - е преведено като ‘’себе-съзнание’’; ‘’себе-осъзнаване’’ е също вариант.   
 
### <h3 id="question-19">ВЪПРОС No.19</h3>

Защо жената е прокълната от неравенството. Имайки предвид по-ниското й положение и несправедливото отношение към нея от началото на човешкото съществуване на това ниво? 

Отговор: Първо, трябва да помним че духът не е нито мъж нито жена, но се проявява редуващо се по този начин, като правило. Ние всички сме били мъже и ние всички сме били жени. За това не може да става въпрос за неравенство, ако гледаме на живота от по-обхватна гледна точка. Определени уроци трябва да бъдат научени от духа през всяка епоха от позицията на жена, други уроци могат да бъдат научени само чрез инкарнация в мъжко тяло. Затова по необходимост се налага промяна на пола. Разбира се, понякога се случва поради определени причини един човек да трябва да се появява като мъж през няколко последователни прераждания, после разбира се, когато той се облече в женска дреха (условно казано ‘’дреха’’) тя може да го дразни силно. В този случай имаме много мъжествена жена, може би боркиня за равенство или с войнствена натура. От друга страна, духът може да бъде облечен в женска дреха по време на няколко прераждания и след това може да се появи като мъж с много женствен характер. Но въпреки че редуващото се прераждане има хипотетичен характер, много от нас са били родени в древен Рим в противоположния пол и взимайки пред вид закона за причинността, третирането на жените от мъжете през онова време не е било такова, че да накара онези римски жени когато са преродени сега като мъже да са склонни на голяма отстъпка към техните предишни господари. 

### <h3 id="question-20">ВЪПРОС No.20</h3>

Защо страданието на Маргарита е било толкова силно и несъизмеримо с това на Фауст, стигнало се е дори до затвор и смъртна присъда, докато неговият живот, свобода и право на щастие са останали непокътнати? 

Отговор: Този въпрос ни насочва към един от митовете достигнали до нас през вековете и противно на популярно възприетото мнение един мит не е история предаваща явно същността на разказа, а е забулена истина разкриваща в символи велики духовни принципи. Митовете са дадени на човечеството през неговия ранен стадий на развитие по същата причина поради който ние даваме на децата етични уроци под формата на детски приказки и илюстровани книжки. По този начин те се възприемат от детския разум, по друг начин нормалното интелектуално познание никога не би могло да се възприеме. 

Гьоте, който е бил един посветен, е изложил този мит за Фауст по един чудесен и поучителен начин и ключът към проблема се намира в пролога който се развива на Небето. Синовете на Бог се появяват пред трона и дяволът е сред тях защото той също е един от синовете на Бога. На него му се дава разрешение да се опита да съблазни Фауст с цел да се активизират духовни процеси с резултат култивиране на добродетел. Една от нашите големи грешки е да смятаме невинност и добродетел за синоними; всеки един от нас е роден невинен, той идва тук без никакво зло, всичко е било изчистено, но той притежава определени тенденции които може да се развият в порок; той трябва да бъде изпитан през всеки живот дали ще се предаде на изкушението и ще приеме порока или ще остане силен и ще развие добродетел. Фауст е бил изкушен, той пада, но след това искрено се разкайва и превръща злите сили в добро, така че накрая е спасен. Разкаянието и промяната преди смъртта са изработили неговото спасение; нечистата страст която е изпитал към Маргарита е отстъпила място на чистата му любов към Елена. Маргарита също отстъпва пред изкушението, тя се разкайва и е спасена чрез опрощаване на греховете. Вижда се, че в първия случай е на лице спасение чрез действия. Чрез своята енергия която доминира над злите сили, Фауст изгражда нова земя, земя на която свободни хора могат да живеят при по-добри условия; той се стреми да повдигне човечеството на по- високо ниво и благодарение на този акт, благодарение на неговата безкористна работа за другите той е избавен от силите на злото. В случая на Маргарита, спасението е резултат на молитва и разкаяние. Следователно, в тази драма както е представена от Гьоте, ние откриваме перфектен символ на Западното Учение който тук е представен от двата аспекта: прощаване на греховете и заличаване на погрешно действие чрез съответното му правилно действие. Смъртта идва при всички и страданието предизвикано от погрешно действие за двете страни със сигурност не е било по-малко за Фауст за който то е било удължено за по-дълъг период от време, от случая на Маргарита, за която животът приключва след много по-кратко време. Единствената разлика е, че Фауст е победил изкушението съзнателно и в бъдещи животи ще има имунитет срещу него, докато случаят на Маргарита е проблематичен. През бъдещия живот на земята тя отново ще трябва да се срещне с изкушението за да може да стане ясно дали тя е развила в себе си силата на характера да се противопоставя на погрешното и да остане вярна на правилното действие. 

### <h3 id="question-21">ВЪПРОС No.21</h3>

Има ли някъде текст, или в Стария Завет или в Новия Завет, където на хората се казва да се женят и след това да живеят като брат и сестра по всяко време и при всички условия? И ако няма в Библията, защо вие ни учите така? 

Отговор: Древните семити са били петата от Атлантските раси. Те се спасили от потъващата Атлантида, както е написано с вариации в историите за Ной и Мойсей. Те трябвало да отидат в Обещаната Земя, но не малката и незначителна Палестина, а цялата земя, както е създадена и устроена сега. Тя е била обещана защото тогава земята е била в процес на промяна, както обикновено преди една нова раса да я насели. Порои разрушили Атлантската цивилизация и семето на сегашните Ариански (Арийски) раси се отправило към пустошта на Гоби в Централна Азия. 

В периода, когато такова семе е трябвало да се превърне в раса населяваща целия свят, раждането на деца естествено е било от първостепенно значение. Затова се е смятало, че дълг на всеки е да има много деца и да бъде изключително плодовит. Но ние сега живеем в съвременния свят, светът е добре населен и не са необходими специални усилия за нуждата от инкарниращи се Его. Ние никога не сме препоръчвали пълно полово въздържание или че хората трябва да се женят и след това да живеят през цялото време като брат и сестра; но ние мислим че семейните хора, в зависимост от условията в които живеят, би трябвало да помагат за осигуряване на продължителността на рода. С други думи, ако двамата съпрузи са физически, морално и умствено в добро състояние, ако имат дом където прераждащ се Его би могъл да има шанс за въплътяване и придобиване на опитност, те би трябвало да се отдадат като жив дар на олтара на човечеството и да дадат субстанции от техните тела за да осигурят един Его с тяло-носител, поканвайки го в своя дом като най-скъп гостенин, благодарни че могат да направят за него това, което други са сторили за тях. Но когато акта на оплождането е бил завършен, те би трябвало да се въздържат от понанатъчни сексуални контакти докато се почувстват напълно готови да създадат тяло за друго дете. Такова е учението на Розенкройцерите отнасящо се до идеалните взаимоотношения между съпруг и съпруга. Същността е, че създаващата функция не би трябвало да се използва с цел задоволяване на чувствени потребности, а само за размножаване на рода, за което тя е била нормално създадена. Това е едно идеално положение и може да е отвъд възможностите на болшинството от хората в днешно време, както и пожеланието да обичаме враговете си, но ако нямаме високи идеали не бихме постигали и прогрес.

Има ли принадлежаща сродна душа на всяка душа през вечността? Ако е така, не би ли било по-добре да останем неженени отколкото да се оженим за неподходящия човек? 

Отговор: Както светлината се пречупва в седемте различни цветове на спектъра когато преминава през атмосферата, така също и духовете които са диференцирани вътре в Бог се разделят на седем големи лъча. Всеки клас е под непосредственото ръководство и опекунство на един от Седемте Духа пред Трона, които са планетарни духовни същности, Звездните Ангели. Всички Девствени духове в техните последователни инкарнации се размесват с цел общуване и придобиване на най-разнообразни опитности; независимо от това, тези които са еманация на един и същ Звезден Ангел са винаги сестри или души- близнаци, и когато те се стремят към възвишен начин на живот, те трябва да поемат по пътя на посвещаването през ложа съставена от членове принадлежащи към същия лъч от който те произхождат за да се върнат към първоначалния си източник. Поради това, всички окултни школи са делими на седем, една за всяка група духове. Това е била причината Христос да каже на учениците си: ‘’Вашият отец е и мой’’ – никой не е могъл да се доближи до него толкова близо колкото тези ученици са били, освен хората които са принадлежали към същия лъч. 

Както други мистерии и тази красива доктрина е била сведена до идея от физическия материален свят, популярната концепция за душите близнаци или афинитета, че едната душа е мъж а другата жена и много често нечий чужд съпруг или чужда съпруга. В тези случаи доктрината за души-близнаци е ползвана за извинение при прелюбодеяние. Това е грозно извращаване. Всеки дух е завършен сам за себе си, той взима мъжко или женско тяло по различно време с цел да учи уроците на живота и само на сегашния етап от развитие съществува такова нещо като пол. Его е съществувал преди пола и ще остане след като тази фаза на проявлението е отминала. 

### <h3 id="question-23">ВЪПРОС No.23</h3>

Лошо ли е ако първи, втори или трети братовчеди встъпят в брак, и ако да, защо? 

Отговор: Целта на брака е размножаването на рода и каквато е физическата природа на родителите и тяхната околна среда, такова ще бъде и детето. Ние откриваме, например, че имигрантите които са дошли на нашия бряг са различни от децата които те създават, че децата които са създадени тук в Америка са различни от децата които биха били създадени в Европа. Например, сицилианците имат глава с издължена форма но създават деца които имат по- овална форма на главата, евреите имат глава със закръглена форма но създават деца с по-елипсовидна форма на главата, това показва тенденцията всички раси да се амалгамират и да се създаде една нова Американска раса. 

Тези промени съвсем не са случайни. Великите водачи на човешкия род винаги се стремят да създават определени условия с цел да се създадат определени типове. Понеже само по този начин могат да се развият качествата необходими за напредък на духа, а е имало времена когато за еволюцията на Его е било необходимо родителите да се женят в рамките на рода. По това време човечеството не е било така развито и индивидуализирано както сега. Хората са били ръководени от родов дух който е навлизал в кръвта посредством въздуха който те са вдишвали за да помага на Его да контролира инструмента си. Тогава хората са имали нещо за което се казва че е ‘’второ зрение’’; а такова второ зрение сега се среща сред хората които по-дълго време са продължили да се женят в рамките на рода, както например планинците в Шотландия или циганите. 

Но се е наложило човек да забрави Духовния Свят за известно време и да не помни никакъв друг живот освен настоящия. За да се осъществи тази промяна в съзнанието, Великите Водачи са предприели определени стъпки, едната от които е била да се забрани женитбата в рода. Когато четем в пета глава Битие че Адам е живял 900 години и всички патриарси са живели векове, това не значи буквално че споменатите хора самите те са били живи толкова дълго време, а кръвта която се е движила във вените им е била предавана директно на наследниците им и тази кръв е съдържала картините от живота на рода, така като сега съдържа картините от един индивидуален живот, защото кръвта е склад на целия жизнен опит. Затова наследниците в родовете на патриарсите са се виждали като Адам, Метусалех и т.н. Разбира се, през вековете тези картини са ставали все по-неясни и когато паметта на Адам изчезнала от кръвта на неговите наследници се казвало, че Адам е престанал да живее. 

Когато човек станал по-индивидуализиран, той е трябвало да се научи да стои здраво на собствените си крака без помощта на родовия дух. Тогава са били разрешени бракове между хора от различни народности и дори такива бракове са били задължителни, а женитбите в рамките на един род повече не били разрешени. Това е унищожило ясновидството. Науката е доказала, че когато кръв от едно животно се влее във вените на друго животно се получава хемолиза или разлагане на кръвта, така че по-нисшето животно бива умъртвено. Но внасяне на чужда кръв направено по какъвто и да е начин винаги убива нещо, ако не формата то поне някакво свойство, и чуждата кръв получена при женитбата убила ясновидските способности, притежавани от примитивния човек. Че това твърдение, че чуждата кръв е разрушителна е вярно, може да се докаже чрез случаите на хибриди. Когато, например, кон и магаре са чифтосани поколението е муле, но на мулето му липсва способността за размножаване защото то не е нито под опекунството на груповия дух на конете нито на магаретата и ако мулетата биха се размножавали, като резултат би се получила порода без контрол от никой групов дух. Мулето, обаче, не е така напред в еволюцията , че да може да управлява инструмента си без помощта на групов дух и затова му липсва свойството за размножаване и груповият дух задържа оплодителния семенен атом. При хората, обаче, е различно. Когато са достигнали нивото когато са били налагани бракове между различни националности, те са били достигнали етапа от еволюцията на себе-съзнание и са могли да се контролират сами и когато те трябва да престанат да бъдат водени от Бога автомати и да станат себе- управляващи се индивидуалности. Колкото повече е смесена кръвта, толкова в по-малка степен вътре живеещият* дух може да бъде повлияван от расовия или родовия духове, които са влияели на нашите предшественици. Поради това, на идващите Его се предоставят по-големи възможности ако се оженим за човек далече от нашия род, отколкото ако пожелаем братовчед за съпружество. 

() - ‘’ indwelling ‘’ – преведено е навсякъде като ‘’вътре живеещ’’, но би могло да се разбира също така и като ’’вътре обитаващ’’ – както например, човек живее в дадено жилище или обитава това жилище.   

### <h3 id="question-24">ВЪПРОС No.24</h3>

Би ли било разумно, двама човека с еднакъв темперамент да се оженят, ако са родени под един и същ зодиакален знак? През август например? 

Отговор: Има данни, че всяка секунда се ражда човек, следователно 3,600 ще бъдат родени за един час, 84,400 за един ден от 24 часа и около два милиона и половина за един месец. Ако те би трябвало да имат еднакъв темперамент и еднаква съдба, тогава би трябвало да съществуват само дванадесетте типа хора, но ние знаем че няма дори двама напълно еднакви човека. Така че глупаво е да се казва че двама души имат еднакъв темперамент защото са се родили под един и същ зодиакален знак, който се определя от месеца на раждане. 

За да се разчете един хороскоп задълбочено, трябва да се вземат под внимание деня и годината когато човекът е бил роден, защото планетите не се намират на едно и също място повече от един път за двадесет и пет хиляди осемстотин и шестдесет и осем години. По нататък, трябва да се вземе под внимание часа на раждане и по възможност да се опитате да разберете минутата, за определяне на бързо променящата се позиция на Луната. Ако вземем под внимание и мястото на раждане, ще можем да изчислим изгряващия знак който дава формата на тялото. Тогава имаме един напълно индивидуален хороскоп, защото градусът на Зодиака който изгрява на източния хоризонт се сменя на всеки четири минути, така че дори в случай на близнаци би трябвало да има различия. 

За да може един астролог да каже дали даден брак ще бъде хармоничен или не, необходимо е той да разчете хороскопите на двамата и да положи усилия да разбере дали тези хороскопи ще бъдат съвместими. Той отсъжда като сравнява асцендентите или изгряващите знаци, които показват физическия афинитет. Позициите на Марс и Венера ще покажат дали те имат една и съща морална преценка, а Слънцето и Луната показват техните душевни качества. Базирайки се на тази информация, той ще може да направи заключение дали техните личности са хармонични, но предсказания базирани на нещо по-непълно от тези изчисления са без всякаква стойност.

При насилствена смърт дали следващият живот, когато човек умира като дете, ще бъде в тяло от същия пол както преди или от противоположния; дали войник убит на бойното поле ще бъде прероден като момче или като момиче или полът играе незначителна роля когато животът е много кратък? 

Отговор: Доколкото авторът е бил в състояние да изследва, изглежда че не се отдава внимание на това при следващия живот. Его използва първата появила се възможност за да се прероди. Всичко което е задължително е материала (или материята) за новите тела-носители да се събере така, че да се направи морален отпечатък (или запис) върху тялото на желанията през живота в Небесния Свят който следва след смъртта като дете. 

Въпросът за пола, общо погледнато, изглежда много разтеглив, поне за тези които както се казва са водили ‘’духовно извисен начин на живот’’, защото такъв живот дава тенденцията виталното тяло да остава почти постоянно положително (или активно) и семенният атом който се намира в соларния плексус (слънчевия сплит) поради това автоматично привлича към себе си увеличаващо се количество положително поляризиран етер, така че независимо от това дали физическото тяло е от мъжки или от женски пол, съставките на виталното тяло остават положителни. Затова, в случая на така наречените ‘’напреднали хора’’, полът играе по-незначителна роля отколкото обикновено и бива в повечето случаи оставен на избора на Его който се стреми към прераждане. 

() - Забележка от мен: може би затова повечето ‘’напреднали хора’’ са мъже, защото имайки положително витално тяло (женско), те си избират и положително плътно тяло (мъжко).

Защо обикновено се казва, че негрите са белязани от проклятието на Каин? Ако те са произлезли от Хам, както е според библейската етнология, как е възможно тази раса да бъде по-стара от синовете на Shem или Japhet? Не е ли най-интелигентната, най-преуспяващата и най-устойчивата раса според историческите източници, а именно Еврейската, тази която се е запазила в най-голяма степен от смесване? 

Отговор: В Библията не се твърди никъде че негрите са произлезли от Хам; освен това известно е че етнологията на Библията, както обикновено се разбира, е абсолютно невъзможна имайки пред вид фактите базирани на геологическите и етнологическите изследвания. Отминали сме вече времената когато някой би си позволил да твърди подобно нещо, каквото например ученият декан на Кеймбричкия Университет е твърдял преди по-малко от 100 години, че Светът е създаден в петък 10ти октомври, 4004 година преди Новата Ера в 9 часа сутринта. Библейската етнология също дава точната година на потопа и подобни събития, но от окултна гледна точка която е придобита чрез директно разчитане на поредицата от картини* на миналото, които ние наричаме памет на природата, случаят е коренно различен. Там откриваме, че е имало различни епохи и големи етапи от развитието на историята на земята и че негрите са били човечеството на третата от тези епохи, Лемурианската. Цялата човешка раса през това време е била с тъмна кожа. След това е дошло времето, наречено Атлантска Епоха, когато хората са били червени, жълти, с изключение на една раса която е била бяла. Тези хора са били древните Семити, петата раса на Атлантида. Тези Атлантци се наричат Нибелунги, или деца на мъглата в древни народни приказки, защото по онова време атмосферата на земята е била съставена от много гъста мъгла. В по-късната половина на Атлантската Епоха тази атмосфера се е кондензирала, в резултат са се появили потопи и постепенно моретата покрили по-голямата част от глобуса. След това атмосферата над земята се е прояснила. Този момент от еволюцията е описан в Библията където Ноа, водачът на Семитите, се спасил от потъващата Атлантида и за първи път е видял небесната дъга, феномен невъзможен за мъгливата атмосфера на ранната Атлантида. Също така четем за такава миграция в историята за Мойсей и израилтяните които успели да избягат от Египет, докато царят на Египет и неговата войска потъват във водите на Червено море. Тези хора са били избрани да станат прародители на нашите сегашни Ариански (или Арийски, от ‘’air’’ - въздух) раси, но не всички от тях са спазили честно заповедите на техния водач. Измежду тях е имало известен брой такива, които ‘’са се отдали на чужда плът’’, а това е било възможно най- голямото престъпление за онова време, защото когато един водач се стреми да заложи нови качества в нова раса, примесът на чужда кръв може да осуети този замисъл. Ето защо някои от тези хора са били изгубени, с други думи, те са били изоставени от своите водачи и не са станали прародители на новото човечество. 

() - картини* - авторът използва на много места думата ‘’pictures’’ - картини, изображения, представи - преведа на е на повечето места като ‘’картини’’ защото се явяват пред вътрешното зрение на ясновидеца. 

Тези които са били изгубени или изоставени, звучи странно, но са днешните Евреи, които навремето са се женили за техните Атлантски събратя противопоставяйки се на заповедите на техния божествен водач, а сега се мислят за ‘’избрания народ’’ от Бог. Няма съмнение че древните Евреи са запомнили своя грях – женитбите извън племето. Така те са заложили в наследниците си силна омраза срещу смесването с други племена и така сега те са верни на забраната да се женят за друговерци. 

Доколкото за това, че те са интелигентни като раса, ние казваме Не! През Поларианската Епоха човек е развивал плътното тяло, а витализиращия принцип през Хиперборианската Епоха. През Лемурианската Епоха е получено тялото на желанията за да даде инициатива за действие, а умът е бил добавен през Атлантската Епоха давайки на човек хитрост. Мисълта, или разсъдъка, е качество което трябва да бъде развито през настоящата Арианска Епоха и ако се разгледат внимателно фактите ще стане ясно, че Евреите са все още силни с атлантското качество – хитрост. 

Водачите на човечеството са се старали да накарат тези хора да се смесят с останалите раси с цел да се повдигнат над сегашното си състояние. Тяхната Библия ни показва как те са били откъснати от останалите хора преди и отново, без никаква полза; те обаче са останали отделни хора. Христос е бил изпратен при тях като един от тях, защото се е смятало че те ще се вслушат в думите на един от тяхната среда, но ‘’те избраха Бараба’’. Това беше последната капка от която чашата преля; стана ясно че не могат да бъдат спасени като цяло. От тогава, те са били разпръснати по целия свят, народ без държава, за да бъдат принудени по този начин да се смесят с другите, но те са толкова твърдоглави че и до ден днешен са останали отделни. Тук в Америка обаче, в ‘’големия претопяващ казан’’, те започват бавно да се променят. Те са били загубени поради женитбите извън племето си с по-нисша раса, но сега ще бъдат спасени чрез женитби с по-напреднали раси, тук на Американския континент. 

### <h3 id="question-27">ВЪПРОС No.27</h3>

Има ли Философията на Розенкройцерите някакво специално учение за възпитанието на децата? 

Отговор: Може би няма нищо по-важно от това. На първо място, умните родители които желаят да дадат на детето си всички преимущества, започват преди раждането на детето, дори преди зачеването му да насочват мислите си с молитви към начинанието с което се захващат и обръщат внимание на това, зачеването да се осъществи под благотворно звездно влияние, когато Луната прекосява знаци поддържащи изграждането на силно и здраво тяло, поддържайки разбира се, техните собствени тела в във възможно най-добро физическо, морално и душевно състояние. 

След това по време на вътреутробното развитие те съхраняват в мислите си идеал за ползотворен живот на идващото създание и възможно най-скоро след раждането изготвят хороскоп на детето, защото идеалният родител е също така и астролог. Ако родителите нямат възможност сами да направят хороскоп, те биха могли поне да изучат звездните знаци, което ще им позволи да разберат какво им казва астролога; но при никакви обстоятелства не бива да се консултират с професионален астролог който проституира със знанията си за пари, а трябва да потърсят помощта на духовно издигнат човек който се занимава с астрология, въпреки че може би ще им се наложи дълго време да търсят такъв. Силните и слабите страни на характера на детето ясно могат да се прочетат от рождения му хороскоп. Тогава родителите ще имат възможност да поощряват доброто и да предприемат подходящи мерки за да възпират злото преди тенденциите да са се превърнали в реалност и по този начин ще могат до голяма степен да помогнат на идващото създание да превъзмогне слабите си страни. 

След това, родителите трябва да разберат, че това което наричаме раждане е само раждането на видимото физическо тяло, което се ражда и постига съвременното високо ниво на развитие за по-кратко време отколкото невидимите тела-носители на човек, защото то е имало най-дълъг еволюционен период. Когато ембрионът е защитен от видимия физически свят бидейки затворен в утробата на майката през време на ембрионалното развитие, така също и по- висшите тела-носители са затворени в капсули от етер и вещество (или материя) от света на желанията, което ги предпазва докато станат достатъчно зрели, за да са в състояние да съществуват при условията на външния свят. 

И така, виталното тяло се ражда на около седем годишна възраст или по време когато на детето му поникват трайните зъби и тялото на желанията се ражда на около четиринадесет години или по време на пубертета. Умът се ражда на около двадесет и една години, когато казваме че човек е достигнал зряла възраст. 

Има определени важни неща за които трябва да се полагат грижи само през определени периоди от растежа и родителите би трябвало да знаят кои са те. Въпреки че органите са оформени когато детето се роди, линиите на растеж се образуват през първите седем години и ако не са очертани правилно през това време, иначе здравото дете може да стане болнав мъж или жена. 

В глава първа на Свети Йоан четем, че ‘’В началото беше Словото… И без него нищо не стана… и Словото стана плът’’. Словото е ритмичен звук и звукът е велик космически създател, затова през тази първа седем годишна епоха от неговия живот, детето трябва да бъде заобиколено от подходяща музика, от музикален език – вълните на ритъма на детски мелодии определено са ценни. Ако са песни, думите не играят никаква роля, значение има само ритъмът; колкото повече детето получава от това толкова по-здраво ще расте. 

Има две важни ключови думи които се отнасят до този период от живота на детето. Те се наричат подражание и пример. На света няма друго същество с толкова голяма способност за подражаване както малкото дете; то повтаря нашия пример да най-малкия детайл, според възможностите си. Затова, родителите които се стремят да се грижат добре за детето си, трябва да бъдат внимателни в присъствието на малкото. Няма смисъл от наставления, детето няма ум, то няма разсъдък, то само може да имитира и то не може да спре да подражава както водата не може да спре да тече надолу по хълма. Ако ние сме си приготвили пикантно ястие, например по френска рецепта, а даваме на детето си друга храна казвайки му че това което ние ядем не е хубаво за него, тогава детето не би могло да яде като нас, но ние посяваме в него апетит за същата тази пикантна храна. Когато порасне и може да си доставя удоволствие, то ще си хапва такива ястия. Затова, грижовните родители ще трябва да се въздържат от храни които не са полезни и алкохол, неща които те не биха желали децата им да употребяват. 

Относно облеклото, може да се каже че през този период детето би трябвало да не съзнава наличието на половите органи, затова облеклото трябва да бъде свободно през цялото време. Това е особено необходимо при малките момчета, защото един от най-лошите навици в по-късна възраст може да бъде в резултат от дразнения причинени от тесни дрехи. 

Трябва да се вземе под внимание и въпроса за наказанията. Той също е важен фактор във всички възрасти за ненавременното събуждане на сексуалната природа и те трябва да се избягват. Няма толкова непокорно дете, което да не се повлияе от метода на награждаването за добрите дела и въздържането от похвала като заслужено наказание за непослушание. Освен това, ние признаваме факта че камшикът пречупва духа на едно куче и често неодобряваме някои хора защото те са си изградили непокорство вместо твърдост на характера – че на тях им липсва воля. Много често това се случва в следствие на наказанията с пръчка, безжалостно прилагани в детството. Нека всеки родител да погледне на това от гледната точка на детето. Как някой от нас би могъл да живее с някого, чиято власт не може да избегне, който е много по-голям и му нанася побой всеки ден? Откажете се от боя и много от общественото зло ще бъде ликвидирано за едно поколение. 

Когато се роди виталното тяло на седем години трябва да бъдат възпитавани качествата възприемане и памет. Ключовата дума за този период би трябвало да бъде авторитет и дисциплина. Не би трябвало, ако имаме преждевременно развито дете, да се стремим да го стимулираме да учи напрегнато с преразход на умствено усилие. Децата чудо обикновено стават мъже и жени с по-ниски от средните умствени способности. В този смисъл, на детето трябва да се позволи да следва своите собствени наклонности. Трябва да се култивират способности за наблюдение, трябва да му се показват живи примери. Нека да види порока на алкохолика; покажете му също така и добрия човек и поставете пред него всички идеали. Възпитавайте го така, че да възприема всичко казано от вас като от личност с авторитет и добри познания, така че винаги да има респект към вас като родители и възпитатели. През този период то също така трябва да бъде подготвено да си служи със силата която сега се събужда у него и която ще му позволи да възпроизвежда неговия род в края на втория период от седем години. Не трябва да се допуска то да получава това знание от неподходящи източници, защото родителите се стесняват да говорят с него за това от ненужно чувство за срам. 

Едно цвете може да бъде взето като пример за обяснение, защото всички деца от най-малкото до най-голямото могат да получат познанието под формата на вълшебна приказка. След като са схванали как се размножават цветята, те ще разберат също и процеса на размножаване в животинското царство и при хората, защото няма разлика, едното е само по-чисто, целомъдрено и свято отколкото другото. И едно малко дете, подготвено по този начин, ще се отнася винаги с благоговеене пред създаващата творческа сила. 

Така екипирано, детето ще бъде добре подготвено за раждането на тялото на желанията по време на пубертета. Когато желанията и емоциите се развихрят, то навлиза в най-опасния период от своя живот, времето на горещата младост от четиринадесет до двадесет и една години, защото през този период тялото на желанията се е активизирало, а умът още не се е родил за да действа като спирачка. През тори период ще бъде добре детето което е израствало в общи линии според дадените по-горе предписания. Неговите родители ще бъдат за него опора и котва, за да му помагат да изплува през този бурен период докато настане времето когато ще бъде напълно родено – на двадесет и една години, когато умът се ражда. 

### <h3 id="question-28">ВЪПРОС No.28</h3>

Защо се раждат деца в семейства където не са желани? 

Отговор: Фактът, че този въпрос има основание да бъде задаван, показва че в нашето общество се случват тъжни събития, което за съжаление е вярно. Първоначалната цел на женитбата е увековечаването на рода и хора, които не желаят да станат родители нямат право да сключват брак. Би трябвало всяко дете да има правото да се роди желано. Но, докато ние сме много внимателни при търсенето и избирането на най-добрата порода сред животните която да използваме за разплод за да получим най-здравите и най-качествените домашни животни, обикновено изобщо не се замисляме за физическата, моралната и психическа съвместимост с този или тази, които да бъдат баща или майка на нашите деца. Всъщност, обикновено се смята за неделикатно и дори неприлично изобщо да се мисли за деца и когато те дойдат, въпреки предпазните мерки, родителите са потънали в скръб. Но законът за причинно-следствената връзка не може да бъде избегнат. Въпреки че може да минат векове, но ще дойде времето когато човек който е бил родител нежелаещ дете, ще търси отново въплътяване и може би тогава той ще бъде прероден в семейство където не е добре дошъл. Или може би родителят непожелал дете през един живот ще стане бездетен през следващия. Авторът знае за случаи на семейства благословени с много деца, които родителите са желали и обичали силно, но децата едно след друго са умирали докато са били малки причинявайки на родителите си голямо страдание. 

### <h3 id="question-29">ВЪПРОС No.29</h3>

Когато някои деца не идват при съпруг и съпруга които силно ги желаят, няма ли някакъв начин, някоя душа от невидимия свят да се накара да приеме тяхната молба за реинкарнация? Когато някъде има благоприятни условия за дом, може би измежду много души чакащи инкарнация поне за една от тях тези условия биха били подходящи. 

Отговор: Без съмнение, това са случаи когато потенциални родители някога по време на предишен живот са пренебрегнали възможността за родителство или дори са се предпазвали от бременност. Или ако случаят не е такъв, може би по- късно, техните надежди ще се сбъднат. Авторът е бил свидетел на случай, когато дух желаещ инкарнация е придружавал майката и авторът е бил осведомен от някой друг който е познавал майката, че този Его я е придружавал още преди женитбата й. След женитбата, обаче, се оказало че родителите са бездетни и наскоро се появи новината за развод. Стана ясно, че този Его желаеше инкарнация чрез тази майка, но не одобряваше бащата. Понякога научаваме за семейства които са бездетни и след това след разтрогване на брака и след като мъжът и жената са се оженили отново и двамата са имали деца, този факт показва че са били напълно способни физически да бъдат родители, липсвал е само прераждащият се Его. Затова трябва да се отбележи, че без да има Его желаещ въплътяване чрез дадена брачна двойка, техните усилия да имат дете ще бъдат безрезултатни. 

От общоприета гледна точка, не би трябвало да има обяснение на факта, че при един и същи биологически строеж на сперматозоида и яйцеклетката понякога може да се осъществи оплождане и понякога не, ако само този фактор е от значение. Ние знаем, че ако смесим кислород и водород в подходящи пропорции винаги ще получим вода; ние знаем че водата винаги тече надолу от високо към ниско; следователно всички природни закони действат постоянно и по един и същи начин, така че ако не съществува някакъв друг фактор, биологическото смесване на съдържанието на сперматозоида и яйцеклетката винаги би дало резултат. Този непознат и невидим фактор е прераждащият се Его който присъства само там където му харесва и без когото никога не може да има резултат. 

Ако задаващият въпроса се моли искрено на ангела Габриел който е първостепенен фактор за създаване на тела (виж Библията), това може би ще бъде от полза за получаване на желания резултат. Най-благоприятното време за това е понеделник по изгрев слънце и от новолуние да пълнолуние. 

### <h3 id="question-30">ВЪПРОС No.30</h3>

Как обяснявате факта, че едно дете толкова често наследява лошите черти на характера на родителите си? 

Отговор: Обясняваме като казваме, че това не е факт. За съжаление хората прехвърлят вината за лошите си качества върху наследствеността обвинявайки своите родители за грешките си и запазвайки за своя сметка всичките си хубави качества. Самият факт, че разграничаваме това което е унаследено от това което е наше собствено, показва че има две страни на човешката природа, от едната страна е формата, а от другата живота. 

Човекът. Мислителят, идва тук екипиран с душевни и морални качества които са си изцяло негови взимайки от родителите си материя(субстанция) само за физическото тяло. Ние сме привлечени към определени хора според закона за причинността и според закона за асоциацията. Същият закон който кара музикантите да търсят в концертната зала компанията на други музиканти, играчите да се събират при пистите за надбягване на коне или в игралните зали, хората с изследователски наклонности да се тълпят в библиотеките (не и в днешно време…) и т.н. Този закон действа така, че хората с подобни наклонности, качества и вкусове да се раждат в една и съща семейна верига. Затова, когато чуваме някой да казва: ‘’Да, аз знам че съм прахосник, но и моите сродници не са свикнали да работят, ние винаги сме имали прислуга’’ това показва само, че обяснението е еднакви наклонности и нищо повече. Когато друг човек казва: ‘’О, да, аз знам че съм екстравагантен, но нищо не мога да променя, това го има в цялата фамилия’’. Това е отново законът за асоциацията и колкото по-скоро разберем, че вместо да се извиняваме със закона за наследствеността, трябва да се стараем да побеждаваме лошите си навици и да култивираме добродетели, толкова по-добре ще бъде за нас. Ние не бихме могли да приемем за валидно извинението на алкохолик ако той казва: ‘’Не, не мога да спра да пия, всичките ми роднини пият’’. Ние бихме му казали да се отдалечи от тях колкото се може по-скоро и да разчита само на себе си и бихме посъветвали хората да престанат да се крият зад зависимостта си от своите родители и прародители и да я използват като извинение. 

### <h3 id="question-31">ВЪПРОС No.31</h3> 

Не е ли вярно, че детето наследява кръвта си и нервната си система от своите родители? Ако е така, не би ли трябвало да наследи също така и болестите и нервните разстройства? 

Отговор: Във фетуса, в областта на долната част на трахеята, точно над sternum или гръдната кост се намира жлеза с вътрешна секреция наречена тимус, която е по-голяма по време на ранното детство и постепенно атрофира с растежа на детето и изчезва напълно с навършването на четиринадесет години или малко преди това, много често когато костите са се развили напълно. Учените са били много озадачени относно предназначението на тази жлеза и няколко теории са били създадени да обяснят функцията й в организма. Една от тях твърди, че жлезата снабдява организма с веществата необходими за изграждането на червени кръвни телца докато костите на детето не са оформени напълно за да могат да създават негови собствени червени кръвни клетки. Тази теория е вярна. 

По време на ранното детство Его, който притежава детското тяло, не владее все още напълно това тяло и ние признаваме че детето не е отговорно за действията си; преди време това важеше до седем годишна възраст, по-късно удължихме този срок до четиринадесет години. През това време не може да бъде търсена никаква съдебна отговорност от детето за неговите действия и това е правилно защото Его, намирайки се в кръвта, може да функционира правилно в своя собствена кръв, а както е през детството, запасът от кръв е предоставен на детето от неговите родители чрез тимусната жлеза, детето не е още свой собствен господар. Затова децата не казват за себе си ‘’Аз’’ през ранното детство, а се идентифицират със семейството си; те са Татковото момиченце и Маминото момченце. Малкото дете ще каже; ‘’Иванчо иска’’ онова, но щом достигнат възрастта на пубертета и са започнали да произвеждат свои собствени червени кръвни телца, тогава ще чуем момчето или момичето да казва: ‘’Аз’’ искам да направя това. Тогава те започват да отстояват своята собствена идентичност и да прекъсват връзките си със семейството. 

Ясно е, че защото през годините на детството кръвта и тялото (организма) са наследени от родителите, тенденциите към заболявания също са наследени, не самите заболявания, а само тенденцията. След четиринадесетата година, когато вътреживеещият Его е започнал да произвежда свои собствени кръвни телца, в най-голяма степен зависи от него самия дали тези тенденции ще се проявят като болести през живота му. 

() - ‘’ indwelling ‘’ – преведено е навсякъде като ‘’вътре живеещ’’, но би могло да се разбира също така и като ’’вътре обитаващ’’ – както например, човек живее в дадено жилище или обитава това жилище.   

### <h3 id="question-32">ВЪПРОС No.32</h3>

Може ли на човек да се въздейства по време на естествен сън така както може да му се въздейства по време на хипнотичен сън или има разлика? 

Отговор: Да, има разлика. По време на естествен сън Его облечен в ума и тялото на желанията се измъква от физическото тяло и обикновено се рее над тялото или във всеки случай остава близо до него, свързан посредством сребърната нишка, докато виталното тяло и плътното тяло почиват в леглото. 

Тогава върху този човек може да се влияе чрез възбуждане на мисли и идеи в мозъка му, които искаме да му предадем. Обаче, тогава не можем да го накараме да прави нещо или да възприеме една идея, освен ако не е съвместимо с неговите собствени наклонности. Не е възможно да му заповядаме да прави нещо и да го подчиним на нашата воля, което е възможно ако беше изведен извън тялото чрез действия на хипнотизатор, защото мозъкът движи мускулите, а по време на естествен сън мозъка е проникнат от неговото собствено витално тяло и той перфектно се контролира сам, докато по време на хипнотичен сън действията на хипнотизатора са предизвикали извличането на етера, от който се състои виталното тяло, извън мозъка надолу до раменете на жертвата където той лежи около врата му и наподобява яка на пуловер. Тогава плътният мозък е отворен за етера от виталното тяло на хипнотизатора, който замества собствения етер. Затова, при хипнотичен сън жертвата няма избор по отношение на движенията си и на идеите в главата си. Но при обикновен сън човек все още е свободен. Всъщност, този метод на влияние по време на сън, може да се стори твърде полезен на майките в отношенията им с упорити деца, защото ако майката седи до леглото на спящото дете, държи ръката му, говори му така както би му говорила ако беше будно и предава в мозъка му такива идеи които тя би искала то да притежава, тя ще открие че после в будно състояние много от тези идеи са пуснали корени. Също при третиране на човек който е болен или например пристрастен към алкохол, ако майката, сестрата или някой друг използва този метод, те ще открият че е възможно да събудят надежда и да предизвикат подобряване на здравословното състояние, чрез реално подобрение или чрез добавяне на вяра в собствените сили. Този метод, разбира се, може да бъде използван недобронамерено, но ние не можем да се въздържаме да го публикуваме защото вярваме че доброто което може да бъде сторено по този начин ще бъде много повече от малкото на брой случаи когато ще се злоупотреби с него с лоши намерения.

Какво представляват сънищата? От тях всички ли означават нещо и как бихме могли да повикаме или да подбуждаме сънища? 

Отговор: В будно състояние, всички тела-носители на Его – умът, тялото на желанията, виталното тяло и плътното тяло са концентрични. Те заемат едно и също пространство и Его функционира отвътре навън във физическия свят. Но през нощта, по време на сън без сънища, Его, облечен в тялото на желанията и ума, се измъква оставяйки физическото и виталното тела в леглото и оставайки по-низшите и по-висшите носители без връзка помежду им освен една, тънка блестяща нишка, наречена сребърната нишка (или корда). Понякога, обаче, когато Его е работил много интензивно и задълбочено във Физическия Свят и тялото на желанията е така възбудено, че отказва да напусне по-низшите носители, то се извлича само наполовина. Тогава връзката между сетивните центрове на тялото на желанията и сетивните центрове на физическия мозък са частично прекъснати. Его вижда картини и сцени от Света на Желанията, които всъщност са твърде фантастични и илюзорни, и те се предават на мозъчните центрове без да бъдат обвързани с някаква логична причина. Това предизвиква всички глупави и фантастични сънища които ни се явяват. 

Понякога, обаче, се случва така, че когато Его е напълно извън плътното тяло, както в сън без сънища, той вижда събитие засягащо него самия в близко бъдеще, идващите събития се усещат предварително защото преди нещо да се случи в материалния свят то вече се е случило в духовните светове. Ако, при събуждане след такова преживяване Его съумее да запомни в мозъка това което е видял, това е случай на пророчески сън който в съответното време наистина ще се случи, или ако съдбата му позволява, Его може да промени хода на събитията чрез ново действие. Например, ако е предупреден за възможен нещастен случай, той би могъл да предприеме мерки за да противодейства на застрашаващото бедствие. 

Относно втората част на въпроса: ‘’Как може да извикваме или да подбуждаме сънища’’, бихме могли да кажем, че няма смисъл да извикваме или подбуждаме объркващи фантастични сънища, а колкото до другите видове сънища, идва време в живота на човек когато той започва да води духовно извисен начин на живот. Тогава постепенно, след определени духовни тренировъчни упражнения, той развива способността да напуска тялото си съзнателно през нощта или по всяко друго време. Тогава той е в пълно съзнание в невидимите светове. Той може да отиде където пожелае до края на земята за минути и след като се научи да работи съзнателно в тези невидими светове, той вече не сънува, а живее друг живот който е по-пълен и по-реален от този който живее сега. 

### <h3 id="question-34">ВЪПРОС No.34</h3>

Какво представлява сънят и каква е причината тялото да заспива? 

Отговор: През деня виталното тяло усвоява безцветния слънчев флуид, който се намира навсякъде около нас, посредством далака. Тази животворяща субстанция насища цялото тяло и се възприема от ясновидец като флуид с бледо розов цвят който се разпространява след навлизането във физическия организъм.Той протича по всеки нерв и когато се изпраща от мозъчните центрове в особено голямо количество, движи тези мускули към които съответните нерви провеждат сигнали. 

Виталното тяло, може да се каже, е съставено от точки или върхове на остриета които се подават във всички посоки: навътре, навън, нагоре, надолу, навсякъде в тялото и всяка малка точка прониква центъра на един от химическите атоми (или частица), карайки го да вибрира с по-голяма честота отколкото е неговата естествена честота на трептене. Това витално тяло изпълва (прониква) плътното тяло от раждането до смъртта при всички условия, с едно изключение, когато например циркулацията на кръвта се преустанови в някоя част на тялото, например когато ни изтръпне ръката. Тогава, ако притежаваме ясновидски способности бихме видели етерната ръка на виталното тяло да виси под видимата ръка като ръкавица и химическите частици на ръката как вибрират с тяхната естествена бавна честота на трептене. След като разтрием ръката за да я почувстваме отново, особеното чувство на пробождане се причинява от точките на виталното тяло които тогава навлизат отново в спящите частици на ръката и ускоряват вибрациите им. 

По подобен начин виталното тяло напуска плътното тяло когато човек умира. Удавниците, след като са били съживени, изпитват една интензивна болка предизвикана от навлизането на тези остриета-точки което се чувства като убождания. 

През деня, когато слънчевия флуид е бил абсорбиран в големи количества от човек, тези точки на виталното тяло са по-раздути или по-широки, но с напредването на деня вредните вещества от обмяната се натрупват все повече във физическия организъм, тогава виталният флуид започва да тече все по- бавно, вечер настъпва момент когато точките на виталното тяло не получават в пълен обем животворящия флуид; те се свиват и атомите на тялото постепенно започват да се движат все по-бавно. Затова Его започва да чувства тялото тежко, безчувствено и изморено. Накрая настъпва момент, когато като че ли виталното тяло колабира и вибрациите на атомите на плътното тяло стават толкова бавни, че Его не може повече да движи тялото. Принуден е да напусне носителите си за да им даде възможност да се възстановят. Тогава казваме, че тялото е заспало. 

Обаче, може да се каже, че сънят не е пасивно състояние, ако беше така нямаше да чувстваме разлика сутрин и нямаше да има възстановителна дейност по време на сън. Най-мощната възстановителна дейност на света. 

Когато едно жилище се разнебити след продължителна употреба и е необходимо да се поправи и поднови, хората които са живели в него трябва да напуснат за да предоставят пространство за дейност на работниците. По същата причина Его напуска жилището си през нощта. Както работниците поправят къщата за да я направят годна за ново обитаване, така и Его трябва да се грижи за дома си преди да стане готов за връщане обратно. Такава работа ние извършваме през нощта, въпреки че нямаме съзнателен спомен за нея когато сме будни. Това е тази дейност която изхвърля отпадните вещества (отровите) от организма и като резултат сутринта тялото е свежо и пълно с енергия когато Его влиза обратно когато се събуждаме от сън. 

### <h3 id="question-35">ВЪПРОС No.35</h3>

Дали розенкройцерите вярват в традиционната медицина или те следват метода на лечение на Христос? 

Отговор: Общо взето, признато е от най-добрите практикуващи лекари, че официалната медицина е една емпирична наука; че лекарствата не действат по един и същи начин на всички хора и затова е необходимо лекарят да експериментира със своя пациент. Следователно, официалната медицина е незадоволителна сама за себе си. Не може да се разчита, че лекарствата ще действат по всяко време. 

Ясно е, че докато тревата служи за храна на всички крави, а всички лъвове ядат месо, при хората, обаче, винаги има елемент на индивидуалност която прави всеки различен от всички останали и тази особеност на човешкия вид произтича от факта, че докато всеки животински вид е израз на един групов дух който ръководи отделните животни отвън, във всяко човешко същество има един индивидуален вътре-живеещ дух, един Его, и затова храната на даден човек може да представлява отрова за друг. 

Само когато официалната медицина се съобразява с този факт тя може да бъде полезна при всички случаи, а за да се разберат особеностите на духа който живее в тялото на пациента трябва да се състави хороскопа му за да се види кога времето е подходящо за приемане на лекарствата, за да се дадат лечебните вещества и билки в подходящото време. Парацелзий е правил това и затова винаги е имал успех с пациентите си; никога не е допускал грешки. Има лекари които в днешно време използват този метод; авторът, например, го е използвал за да поставя диагноза в много случаи. Тогава той е могъл да определи кризите на пациента в миналото, настоящето и бъдещето; и поради това е бил в състояние да облекчи страданията причинени от различни заболявания. За такива цели трябва да се използва астрологията, а не за предсказване на богатство, защото като всички духовни науки тя трябва да се използва за доброто на човечеството, а не за постигане на користни цели. Ако лекарите биха изучавали науката астрология, те биха били в състояние с много малко усилия да диагностицират състоянието на своите пациенти по начин невъзможен от гледна точка на традиционната диагностика. Някои лекари възприемат вече този факт и са открили благодарение на опита си, че небесните тела имат влияние върху човешкия организъм. Например, когато авторът беше в Портланд щата Орегон, един лекар спомена, че според неговия опит винаги когато е било възможно да извърши една операция през време когато Луната е била нарастваща, или с други думи когато се е движила от новолуние към пълнолуние, операцията е била успешна и не е имало никакви усложнения. От друга страна, той е установил, че когато обстоятелствата са го принуждавали да оперира когато Луната се е движила от пълнолуние към новолуние винаги е имало опасност от неприятности и че такива операции никога не били така успешни както тези извършени когато Луната е била нарастваща. 

Също така, съществува тенденция лекарите да лекуват все повече използвайки внушения, давайки на пациента безобидно хапче плацебо и благотворно внушение. Всяка майка, независимо от това дали познава силата на внушението или не, понякога несъзнателно го прилага при грижите и възпитанието на детето си. Ако малкото падне, зависи от нейното внушение дали детето ще заплаче или ще се засмее. Ако тя му каже: ‘’О, горкото ми мъничко бебенце, ти си удари главата много лошо, горката мъничка главичка’’, детето ще започне да плаче; но ако тя посочи към пода и възкликне:’’О, мили Боже, как удари горкия под, целуни го бързо да му мине!’’, детето ще съжали пода че го боли и няма да се сети за собствената си болка. 

По подобен начин лекарят влияе на своя пациент и наистина е престъпление от страна на лекаря ако влезе в болничната стая с мрачно изражение казвайки на пациента да си направи завещанието защото не му остава много да живее. Тези неща влияят на пациента много по-силно отколкото се мисли и много лекари поради това са убили тези които иначе биха спасили. От друга страна, ако лекарят е ведър и влиза в болничната стая с усмивка и окуражителна дума, ако той даде безобидно лекарство и благотворно внушение пациентът ще бъде подтикнат към подобрение, докато в противния случай би бил победен от болестта. Затова внушението е далеч отвъд традиционната медицина. Вярата, която пациентът има към лекаря, ще направи чудеса, за добро или за зло, и вярата е била в основата на метода който Христос е използвал при лечение. Ако питащият погледне в Библията примерите където Христос е излекувал болни, той ще открие че винаги е имало въпрос касаеш вярата на желаещия да оздравее. Към всеки Христос се обръща с думите: ‘’Съответно на вярата ти, да бъде’’. 

Че скептицизмът е унищожавал дори Неговата сила, може би най-ясно това е изложено в тази част от Библията, където се казва че Той е отишъл в своя роден град и установил там, че високо тачен пророк може да няма успех. Тази история са разказва в 13 глава на Матей, също и от Марк, и забележително е че в последния абзац в 13 глава на Матей се казва, че Той не е направил нищо значимо поради безверието на хората. Марк ни казва, че поради техния скептицизъм Той е могъл да излекува само малко на брой хора, докосвайки ги с ръцете си. 

Непредубеденият възприемчив разум е съществена предпоставка за всяка изследователска работа, а скептицизмът е абсолютно вреден ако искаме да получим нови знания. Като илюстрация можем да споменем случай когато авторът беше в Колумбус преди няколко години и там той посети лекцията на професор Хислоп, секретар на Асоциацията за Медиумистични Изследвания. Предметът на лекцията беше ‘’Нови доказателства за бъдещ живот’’. Авторът беше учуден защото професор Хислоп не изнесе в своята лекция дори един единствен факт който е бил публикуван през последните 10 години в изданията на асоциацията към която той принадлежи. Но обяснението дойде след лекцията, когато един въпрос стана повод да се разбере факта, че проф. Нислоп не вярва в нищо от това което е изнесено в публикациите на асоциацията. Той не вярваше в резултатите получени от всеки друг освен от него самия. Тези доказателства, които той току що представи, са били събирани само от него затова те бяха нещо ново и той очакваше публиката да ги приеме, въпреки че той самият нямаше желание да приеме резултатите от изследванията на никой друг. И като илюстрация за това как действа скептицизмът, той несъзнателно даде следния пример, като разказа как веднъж посетил сеанса на един медиум когато покойникът Ричард Ходсон говорил чрез медиума. Професор Хислоп му задал въпрос, впрочем много обикновен, но на Р. Ходсон му било много трудно да даде отговор. Накрая професор Хислоп нетърпеливо казал: ‘’Защо, какво ти става Ричард; когато беше жив ти беше доста бърз; защо сега не можеш да отговориш?’’. Тогава, каза професор Хислоп, дойде отговора, бърз като светкавица: ‘’О, всеки път когато влизам в твоята нещастна окаяна аура аз се разсипвам на парчета’’.Професор Хислоп не можеше да разбере причината защо. Критикарското скептично отношение на професор Хилсоп е било причината за голямото затруднение на Ричард Ходсон да комуникира. Следователно, можем да кажем, че ние вярваме в традиционната медицина когато се използва в комбинация с астрологията, а също така и в метода на лекуване на Христос който е лекуване чрез вяра и в силата на внушението и в различни други системи на лекуване. Те всички притежават някаква истина, но за съжаление много от тях се практикуват несериозно и водят да екстремни ситуации. Тогава те губят силата си за добро и стават заплаха за тези, на които иначе биха могли да помогнат. 

### <h3 id="question-36">ВЪПРОС No.36</h3>

След като страданието е резултат от наши собствени действия, мислите ли че е погрешно да се приемат болкоуспокояващи лекарства от човек който не е неизлечимо болен или умиращ? 

Отговор: Въпросът разкрива начин на мислене който е изключително погрешен, все едно да се пита дали е правилно да се направи опит да се спаси давещ се човек, та нали падането във водата е също следствие от някаква причина породена от действията на този човек. Разбира се, че трябва да приемаме лекарства предписани ни от подходящ квалифициран специалист или да се опитваме да се излекуваме от болестите от които страдаме по всеки възможен начин. Ние бихме постъпили безспорно погрешно ако оставим нашия физически инструмент да се повреди поради липса на подходящи грижи и внимание. Той е най-ценния инструмент който притежаваме и ако не го използваме благоразумно и не се грижим за него ние сме отговорни пред закона за причинно-следствената връзка защото сме го изоставили. 

Въпрос като този разкрива една общо-взето погрешна идея за процеса причина – следствие. Наше задължение е да се опитваме да надмогнем условията които регулират и определят нашия живот. Има едно хубаво малко стихотворение което изразява тези мисли: 

```
‘’Един кораб плава на изток, а друг на запад   
при едни и същи ветрове които духат.   
Значи платната на кораба, а не стихията   
е това което определя накъде ще се отправи.   

Като морски ветрове са пътищата на съдбата   
когато пътешестваме през живота,   
затова действието на душата е това което определя крайната цел,   
а не мирът или бурята край нас.’’   
```

Ако се стараем да обръщаме платната при нашето пътешествие през живота в правилната посока, винаги ще можем да коригираме и дори изцяло да променяме условията и ще управляваме живота си както искаме, вместо да чакаме бездейно облаците да се разпръснат, защото всъщност ние самите сме си направили тези облаци. Самият факт, че ние сме ги създали, трябва да ни вдъхнови и да ни даде кураж и сила да ги развалим или да ги отблъснем на далече, колкото е възможно по-скоро. 

### <h3 id="question-37">ВЪПРОС No.37</h3>

Какъв вид лечение вие препоръчвате, от лекари или лечители, както е според Христовото учение? 

Отговор: Това зависи от вида на заболяването и от характера на пациента. Ако това е случай на счупен крак, трябва очевидно да посетим хирург. Ако заболяването е вътрешно и ако е възможно да се намери лекар със широки възгледи, тогава в някои случаи той трябва да се повика. От друга страна, ако може да се повика духовен лечител, лечител следващ Христовото учение или някой друг който използва спиритуалистичен метод на лекуване, те могат да помогнат на човек който има силна вяра, защото както един камертон който е настроен на даден тон отговаря когато друг камертон от същия тон бива ударен, така и човекът изпълнен с вяра отговаря на въздействието на по-горе споменатите лечители. Но ако на пациента липсва вяра, далеч по-добре е да се повика обикновен лекар на когото пациентът има доверие, защото здраве или болест почти изцяло зависят от съзнанието, а в състояние на болест когато човек е отпаднал, той става свръхчувствителен и не бива да му се отказва това което той предпочита. Освен това, всяка система на лечение има своите хубави страни и ефектът върху даден човек ще бъде положителен или отрицателен в точно съответствие с вярата му в нейната лечебна сила. 

### <h3 id="question-38">ВЪПРОС No.38</h3>

Какво е мнението ви относно гладуването като метод на лечение? 

Отговор: Лесно е да се разбере, че на запад има повече хора които умират от прехранване, отколкото от недостиг на храна. И при определени условия гладуването за ден или два е безспорно полезно, но както има лакомници, така също има други които прекаляват в обратното и гладуват до краен предел. Това е много опасно. Най-добре е да се храним умерено и да приемаме подходящи видове храна; тогава изобщо няма да е нужно да гладуваме. 

Ако изучаваме химическия състав на хранителните продукти, ние ще открием че дадена храна притежава свойства полезни за организма при наличието на дадено заболяване и ако се използва по подходящ начин, храната е наистина лекарство. Например всички цитрусови плодове са великолепно антисептично средство. Те прочистват храносмилателния тракт. Затова те предпазват от болести. Всички житни храни, особено оризът, са антитоксини; те ще ликвидират болестта и остатъците от процеса на разлагане. Затова, познавайки тези полезни от медицинска гледна точка, свойства на различните видове храни, ние бихме могли бързо да определим вида на храната която трябва да се приема за да се излекуват обичайните болести с храна вместо чрез гладуване. 

### <h3 id="question-39">ВЪПРОС No.39</h3>

Смятате ли че е погрешно да се използва хипноза за лечението на вреден навик или пристрастеност, какъвто е например алкохолизма? 

Отговор: Решително да. От гледна точка само на един живот такива методи, както например тези прилагани от лечителите на Движението на Емануел, са несъмнено продуктивни и резултатът е едно добро дело. Пациентът седи удобно, приспиван е и получава така наречените ‘’внушения’’. Той става и е излекуван от лошия си навик; от пияница той се превръща в примерен гражданин, който се грижи за съпругата и семейството си и направеното добро изглежда безспорно. 

Но ако се погледне от по-дълбоката гледна точка на един окултист, който вижда този негов живот като един от многото и ако се погледне от гледна точка на ефекта който се получава върху невидимите тела-носители на човек, случаят е до голяма степен различен.Когато човек е приведен в хипнотичен сън, хипнотизаторът извършва сеанси върху него и като резултат от тях се изважда етера от главата на неговото плътно тяло и се замества с етера на хипнотизатора. Тогава човек е под пълен контрол и се владее от друг човек; той няма свободна воля и затова така наречените ‘’внушения’’ реално са команди които жертвата трябва да изпълнява нямайки друг избор освен да се подчини. Освен това, когато хипнотизаторът изтегли своя етер и събуди жертвата, той не е в състояние да премахне всичкия етер който е вкарал в него. Ако се използва подобен случай за сравнение, може да се каже че както малка част от магнетизма индуциран в електрическо динамо преди да може да бъде стартирано за първи път, остава впоследствие и съществува като остатъчен магнетизъм за да се възбужда полето на динамото всеки път когато бива пускано в действие, така също остатъци от малки части от етера на виталното тяло на хипнотизатора в medulla oblongata държи пациента във владеене на хипнотизатора през целия му живот; и поради този факт внушенията се следват от жертвата непрекъснато в периода след събуждането. 

Така жертвата на лечител-хипнотизатор не преодолява лошия си навик със свои собствени усилия, а все едно че се е променил защото е бил в строг тъмничен затвор и въпреки че през този живот той може да изглежда като безгрешен човек, когато отново се върне на земята той ще има същите слабости и ще трябва да страда докато най-накрая той самият ги победи. 

### <h3 id="question-40">ВЪПРОС No.40</h3>

Има ли някакви методи за изчистване на калцираната материя, която се натрупва в нашите тела при неправилен начин на хранене? 

Отговор: Въпросът показва, че задаващият въпроса знае за това, че нашите тела постепенно се втвърдяват от детство до старост, заради тебеширената субстанция съдържаща се в повечето храни които приемаме. Тази съдържаща калций материя е отложена предимно в стените на артериите и вените, причинявайки известната в медицината артериосклероза или втвърдяване на кръвоносните съдове. Артериите на малко дете са изключително меки и еластични, като гумена тръбичка, но постепенно като напредваме през детството, младостта към старостта, стените на артериите стават все по-твърди пропорционално на натрупването на тебешир (калциев карбонат) отложен от течащата кръв. Така, след време, те могат да станат толкова корави и нееластични, като дръжка на лула. Има такова състояние което се нарича артерия като дръжка на лула (pipe-stem). Тогава артериите стават крехки и могат да се счупят причинявайки кръвоизлив и смърт. Затова е вярно когато се казва, че човек е толкова стар колкото са артериите му. Ако можем да изчистим артериите и капилярите от тази земна материя, ние бихме могли да удължим значително живота и полезното използване на нашето тяло. 

От окултна гледна точка, разбира се, няма значение дали живеем или сме умрели, както се казва, защото смъртта за нас не означава унищожение, а само преместване на съзнанието в други сфери; обаче когато сме пренесли тялото- носител през безполезните години на детството, преминали сме през горещите години на младостта и сме достигнали времето когато имаме свобода на действие и реално сме започнали да натрупваме жизнен опит, тогава колкото повече удължим времето за натрупване на опитност, толкова повече опит ще можем да придобием. Поради тази причина, наистина, удължаването на живота на тялото е много ценно. 

За да се постигне този резултат, трябва на първо място да изберем храните които имат най-малко задръстващи субстанции, които причиняват стесняването и втвърдяването на кръвоносните съдове. В общи линии, това са зеленчуците и плодовете. След това, важно е да се търси начин за изчистване на задръстващата материя която вече се е отложила, ако това е възможно, но науката още не е открила такава храна или лекарство, които със сигурност биха предизвикали такъв ефект. Установено е, че бани с електрически заряд могат да бъдат изключително полезни, но не са напълно ефикасни. Пълномасленото мляко е най-доброто средство за изчистване на тази земна субстанция, на второ място е гроздовият сок. Ако се приемат непрекъснато и в големи количества, тези субстанции значително ще облекчат състоянието на втвърдените артерии.

Не е ли виновна природата за честите физически малформации в растителния и животинския свят, както и в човешкия род и възможно ли е да има напълно оформена и нормална интелигентност със силна воля в болно и увредено тяло? 

Отговор: Бихме попитали, какво разбирате под природа? Вacon е казал, че природа и Бог се различават само както отпечатъкът се различава от печата. Природата е видимия символ на Бог и понастоящем ние сме склонни да мислим за природата по материалистичен начин. Зад всяко явление в природата стоят сили, не слепи сили, а интелигентни (разумни) същности (или интелигенции*). Може би един пример ще ни помогне да разберем връзката ни с тях. 

() - *Intelligences - Преведена е на повечето места като’’интелигенции’’, въпреки че не е възприета в български език. Означава интелигентни или разумни същности. 

Да предположим, че имаме дървен материал и инструменти; и сме заангажирани с изработването на маса и едно куче ни наблюдава. Кучето, същество от по-ниското царство, ще вижда как последователно обработваме дървото и как поставяме плоската част върху краката; то ще вижда как на етапи се реализира масата, то може да наблюдава процеса, обаче то не може да знае за какво се използва масата и не може да разбира какви мисли има в главата ни докато оформяме масата. То просто възприема външното проявление, то ни вижда работещи и вижда резултата. Да предположим, по-нататък, само заради примера, че кучето може да вижда само частите и как те постепенно се оформят в маса, но не може да вижда нас как работим и сглобяваме отделните детайли; тогава кучето ще бъде в подобно положение спрямо нас, както ние сме спрямо силите на природата. Това което наричаме електричество, магнетизъм, растеж и т.н. са интелигенции които са невидими и работят когато се проявяват определени процеси в природата. Природните духовни сили изграждат растенията, оформят кристалите на скалите и заедно с редица други йерархии работят около нас невидимо, но с усилия, създавайки това което ние наричаме природа. 

Те всички са еволюиращи същности, каквито сме и ние и самият факт, че са развиващи се показва че не са перфектни и поради това склонни да допускат грешки които, естествено, се проявяват като резултат в малформации, и така, като отговор на въпроса може да се каже следното: невидими интелигенции които създават това което ние наричаме природа са виновни за често срещаните грешки, така както и ние. 

Колкото до втората част на въпроса, дали може да има напълно оформена и нормална интелигентност със силна воля в болно или увредено тяло, можем да кажем ‘’да, несъмнено’’, но понеже изявата на такава интелигентност зависи от ефективността на нейния инструмент, тя естествено, може да бъде възпрепятствана от физическата деформация, съгласно същия принцип който гласи: няма значение колко умел е майсторът, неговата ефективност до голяма степен зависи от състоянието на инструментите му.

От окултна гледна точка, какъв ефект има ваксинирането? 

Отговор: Учените бактериолози са открили, че много болести се причиняват от микроорганизми които нахлуват в нашето тяло и още, че тази армия от нашественици започне да причинява смущения, организмът започва да изработва микроорганизми с точно обратен начин на действие или субстанция която действа като отрова за нашествениците. Тогава въпросът е, кой е по-силен, нашествениците или защитниците. Ако микробите защитници са по-многобройни отколкото нашествениците или отровата която е пагубна за нашествениците е произведена в достатъчно количество, пациентът се възстановява. Ако защитата е победена или организмът не е в състояние да произведе достатъчно количество серум необходим да отрови нашествениците, пациентът се предава на болестта. По нататък беше открито, че ако някой човек е бил болен и е оздравял успешно, той е придобил имунитет срещу нови атаки на същата болест, защото той има в тялото си серум който е смъртоносен за микробите причиняващи това заболяване което той е прекарал и е оздравял. 

От горе изложените факти могат да бъдат направени следните заключения: 

1\. Ако здрав човек е ваксиниран с малко на брой микроби причинители на дадено заболяване, той ще прекара това заболяване в лека форма. Тогава той ще може да изработи защитния серум и така в бъдеще ще има имунитет срещу това заболяване. Такава е същността на ваксинирането, то предпазва от болести. 

2\. Когато човек се е заразил от някаква болест и не е в състояние да произведе в достатъчно количество серум, който да унищожи нахлуващите микроорганизми, неговия живот може да бъде спасен чрез имунизиране със серум придобит от друг човек който има имунитет към тази болест. 

Тъй като, не е лесно да се взима такъв антитоксин или култури от човешки същества, тези микробни култури и отрови започнаха да се взимат от животни, и много се писа за и против използването на такива методи за борба срещу болестите. Това сега не ни засяга; питащият задава въпрос за окултната гледна точка, от която въпросът се разглежда по-дълбоко отколкото чрез материалистическия подход. Безспорно, има случаи когато болести са били предотвратявани чрез използване на антитоксин; има също така случаи когато ваксинация и антитоксин са довеждали до фатален край там където са прилагани с цел да предпазят, но това е в страни от въпроса. От окултна гледна точка, ваксиниране и използване на антитоксини получени чрез методите използвани в бактериологичните институти са неприемливи. Тези методи използват по жесток начин безпомощни животни и отравят човешкото тяло, така че Его изпитва трудности при използването му като инструмент. 

Ако разгледаме химическия състав на нашата храна, ще открием че хранителните вещества съдържат всички необходими лекарствени средства, и ако ние се храним правилно ще бъдем резистентни срещу заболяванията без ваксинации. 

При нормално здравословно състояние тялото усвоява много по-голямо количество от слънчевата енергия, отколкото може да използва. Излишъкът се излъчва от цялата повърхност на тялото с голяма сила и предотвратява навлизането на микроорганизми които не могат да преодолеят този идващ от вътре поток, и нещо повече: според същия принцип, както един вентилатор би отвял и разпръснал на далече частиците от прах, така този витален флуид прочиства организма от вредни вещества, включително от опасни микроби. Не трябва да ни изненадва факта, че тази сила е разумна и е в състояние да подбира веществата които трябва да бъдат елиминирани, запазвайки полезните които ще бъдат използвани. Както ситото пропуска само частици по- малки от определен размер, така например бъбреците, запазват дадени течности за използване от организма, докато позволяват на ненужните да го напуснат. По подобен начин виталният флуид прави разграничение, той избавя тялото от отрови и опасни вещества получени вътре в организма и противодейства на подобни вещества да проникнат от вън. 

Това свойство е наречено N-лъчи или Odic fluid, от учените, открито посредством светещи химически реагенти. По време на храносмилане този процес е най-слаб, защото тогава е необходимо допълнително количество слънчева енергия за метаболизма вътре в организма, основният фактор за асимилиране (или храносмилане и усвояване на хранителните вещества). Колкото повече храна сме поели, толкова по-голямо количество слънчев флуид се задържа вътре в тялото и толкова по-слаб е елиминиращият защитен поток на вън. Следователно, ние се намираме в най-голяма опасност от нахлуване на армия от враждебни микроорганизми, когато сме преяли. 

От друга страна, ако се храним умерено и подбираме храни които се разграждат лесно, отклоняването на защитния витален поток, съответно, ще бъде минимално и имунитетът ни срещу болести ще бъде повишен без необходимостта от отравяне на тялото ни с ваксина. 

### <h3 id="question-43">ВЪПРОС No.43</h3>

Ако, както твърдите, Его пребивава в кръвта, не е ли опасна практиката да се прелива кръв от здрав човек на болен? Дали това засяга Его или му влияе по някакъв начин, и ако да, как? 

Отговор: Според едно от последните открития на науката – хемолизата, преливането на кръв от вените на по-висше животно във вените на по-нисше уврежда кръвта на по-нисшето животно и причинява смъртта му. Затова вкарването на човешка кръв във вените на каквото и да е животно е с фатален край за животното. Но, установено е, че преливане от човек на човек може да се направи, въпреки че понякога това има пагубни последствия. 

В далечното минало хората са се женили в рамките на рода; гледало се е с неодобрение на опитите на някой който е ‘’потърсил чужда плът’’. А когато синовете на Бога са се оженили за дъщери на хората, с други думи, ако подопечните на някой водач са се женили извън племето, било е смятано за голяма беда, нарушителите са загубвали покровителството на водача и са били убивани защото тогава е трябвало да бъдат развити определени качества в човешкия вид, които ние сега притежаваме. Те са били имплантирани в кръвта, която е трябвало да остане чиста в рода или в малкото племе. По-късно, когато човек е трябвало да бъде спуснат надолу при условия на по-плътна материя, били са изисквани женитби между хора от различни племена и народи и от този момент нататък се е започнало да се гледа със същото неодобрение на женитбите в рамките на една фамилия. 

Старите викинги не са разрешавали на никой да се ожени в техния род преди първо да е преминал през церемонията за смесване на кръвта, за да се разбере дали вливането на кръв от чужденеца в техния род е било пагубно или не. Всичко това е така, защото през тези ранни времена човечеството не е било така индивидуализирано, както е сега. Те са били в по-голяма степен подчинени на расовия или родовия дух, който живеел вътре в тяхната кръв, както груповият дух е в кръвта на животните. По-късно женитбите между хората от различна народност са били дадени на човечеството за да го освободят от тази зависимост и да направят всеки отделен Его духовен господар на неговото собствено тяло, без чужда намеса. 

Науката е открила, по-късно, че кръвта от различни хора има различни съставни елементи-кристали, така че сега е възможно да се отличи кръвта на един африканец от кръвта на един европеец; но ще дойде денят когато ще бъдат открити още по-големи различия, защото както има разлика между кристалите формирани от различните раси, така също има разлика между кристалите формирани от всеки отделен индивид. Няма двама човека с еднакви пръстови отпечатъци и ще бъде установено в бъдеще, че кръвта на всяко човешко същество се различава от кръвта на всеки друг индивид. Тази разлика вече е факт за окултния изследовател и е само въпрос на време, за да бъде установена тя и от науката, защото качествата на различност стават все по-ясно изразени с нарастването на независимостта на човешкото същество и с процеса на нарастване на самостоятелността му. 

Тази промяна в кръвта е от най-голямо значение и след време, когато стане по-ясно изразена, ще бъде възможно да се извършва продуктивна дейност, каквато човек може с най-смели предположения да си представи. Казва се, че ‘’природата създава обекти’’, но природата е видимия символ на Бог, чиято рожба и образ сме ние. Направени по негов образ и подобие, ние също започваме да създаваме обекти, и естествено започваме със субстанцията където ние, човешките духове, Его, имаме най-голяма мощ, в нашата кръв. 

Когато кръвта се движи през артериите, които са дълбоко в тялото, тя е под формата на газ; но понижената температура близо до повърхността на тялото причинява частичното й кондензиране и в тази субстанция Его се учи да създава минерални кристали. През Юпитеровия Период ние ще се учим да влагаме в тях нисша форма на жизненост и да ги излъчваме от себе си като подобни на растения структури. През Венериния Период ние ще сме в състояние да вдъхваме в тях желания и да ги правим подобни на животни. И накрая, през Вулкановия Период, ние ще им дадем ум и ще ги управляваме като расови (или родови) духове. 

В настоящия период, ние сме в самото начало на тази индивидуализация на нашата кръв. Затова сега е възможна трансфузия на кръв от едно човешко същество на друго, но близък е денят когато това няма да бъде възможно. Кръвта на бял човек ще убива всички които се намират по-ниско в еволюцията, и кръвта на напреднал човек ще бъде убийствена за човек който се намира по- назад в еволюционното си развитие. В днешно време, детето получава от своите родители кръв, складирана в тимусната жлеза за годините на детството. Но ще дойде време, когато Его ще бъде толкова силно индивидуализиран, че няма да може да функционира в кръв която не е създадена от самия него, тогава сегашният начин на размножаване ще бъде заменен с друг, при който Его ще може да създава своите собствени тела- носители без помощта на родители. 

### <h3 id="question-44">ВЪПРОС No.44</h3>

Какви са причините за психичните заболявания? 

Отговор: Отговорът на този въпрос би бил много обемист, но би могло да се каже, че от гледна точка на един окултист има четири вида лудост. 

Умопомрачението винаги се причинява от прекъсване във веригата от носители между Его и физическото тяло. Такова прекъсване може да се появи между мозъчните центрове и виталното тяло; или между виталното тяло и тялото на желанията; или между тялото на желанията и ума; или между ума и Его. Прекъсването може да бъде пълно или частично. 

Ако прекъсването е между мозъчните центрове и виталното тяло или между виталното тяло и тялото на желанията, резултатът е ниска интелигентност. Когато прекъсването е между тялото на желанията и ума, буйното и импулсивно тяло на желанията управлява и тогава се получава мания за насилие. Когато прекъсването е между Его и ума, умът управлява останалите тела-носители и се получава мания за лукавство, този маниак може да измами хората които се грижат за него че е напълно безобиден, докато не измисли някаква дяволия. Тогава на яве излиза неговата разстроена психика и вероятно причинява някаква беда. 

Има един случай на лудост, който би било добре да се обясни, понеже понякога може да се избегне. Когато Его се връща от невидимите светове за да се прероди, на него му се показват различните възможни инкарнации. Той вижда идващия живот в неговите основни събития, в повечето случаи като движещи се картини пред неговото зрение. След това му се дава възможност за избор, обикновено между няколко живота. В този момент той вижда уроците които трябва да научи, съдбата която сам си е създал през миналите животи и каква част от кармичните задължения трябва да ликвидира във всяко от въплътяванията които му се предлагат. Тогава той прави своя избор и е отвеждан от Записващите Ангели в страната и семейството където трябва да изживее идващия живот. 

Този панорамен преглед се наблюдава на Трето Небе, където Его е необлечен и се чувства духовно над тежките условия в материалния свят. Той е много по- мъдър, отколкото е тук на земята, където е заслепен от плътта в невъобразимо голяма степен. По-късно, когато се е осъществило зачеването и Его влиза в утробата на майката, около осемнадесетия ден след зачеването, той идва в контакт с етерната матрица на своето ново физическо тяло, която е била създадена от Записващите Ангели да оформи структурата на мозъка и която ще отпечата върху Его необходимите тенденции за отработване на неговата съдба. 

Сега Его вижда отново картини от своя настъпващ живот, както давещият се човек вижда картините на своя изминал живот – като проблясъци. По това време Его вече е частично заслепен за своята духовна природа, така че ако настъпващият живот изглежда много труден, често пъти той се свива и отдръпва от утробата и не си създава необходимите правилни връзки с мозъка. Той може да се помъчи да бързо да се измъкне и тогава вместо да се получат концентрични, както трябва да бъдат виталното и плътното тела, виталното тяло изградено от етер може частично да бъде изтеглено над главата на плътното тяло. В този случай връзката между сетивните центрове на виталното и плътното тела са нарушени и резултатът е вродено слабоумие, епилепсия, St. Vitus танц и други подобни заболявания. 

Нехармонични отношения между родителите, които понякога са на лице, е последната капка която кара Его да почувства, че не може да влезе в такава среда. Затова, не може да има нещо по-сериозно от това да се внуши на бъдещите родители, че по време на ембрионалното развитие на детето е от изключителна важност да бъде направено всичко възможно за да бъде майката в състояние на спокойствие и хармония. Защото, за Его, да влезе в утробата е много трудна задача, това изостря цялата му чувствителност до краен предел и дисхармонични условия в дома, в който той встъпва, разбира се, е допълнителен източник на дискомфорт който може да доведе до по-горе описаните ужасяващи случаи. 

### <h3 id="question-45">ВЪПРОС No.45</h3>

Когато един душевно болен човек умре, дали той ще бъде луд и в света на желанията? 

Отговор: Зависи от това къде се намира прекъсването, защото психическото разстройство представлява прекъсване в телата-носители между Его и физическото тяло, а това разстройство може да се появи между Его и ума, между ума и тялото на желанията или между тялото на желанията и виталното тяло, а също така и между виталното тяло и плътното тяло. Ако прекъсването е между плътното и виталното тела или между виталното тяло и тялото на желанията, Его ще бъде съвършено нормален в света на желанията веднага след смъртта, защото е изоставил тези две засегнати тела. 

Където прекъсването се намира между тялото на желанията и ума, тялото на желанията, всъщност, все още е действащо и, разбира се, често причинява на Его много неприятности по време на съществуването му в Света на Желанията; защото Его, разбира се, никога не е луд. Това което се проявява като лудост произтича от факта, че Его няма контрол върху носителите си; най- лошият случай, очевидно е, когато ума е бил поразен и Его е обвързан към личността за дълго време докато накрая и това тяло не бъде отстранено. 

<h2 id="section-2">РАЗДЕЛ II: Въпроси отнасящи се до ЖИВОТ СЛЕД СМЪРТТА</h2>

### <h3 id="question-46">ВЪПРОС No.46</h3>

Каква е ползата от това да знаем какво има след смъртта, какво се случва в невидимия свят и всички тези неща? Не е ли много по-добре да си знаем само по един свят за даденото време? Не са ли достатъчни неприятностите които той ни причинява. Защо да търсим други? 

Отговор: Ако знаем без съмнение, че по някое време ще бъдем накарани да напуснем страната си и да отидем на друго място за да живеем там много години преди да ни се позволи да се върнем, не би ли било добре за нас да се запознаем с езика, обичаите и законите на тази страна? Така екипирани, ние бихме могли, до голяма степен, да не се чувстваме чужденци и бихме могли да се ползваме от възможностите за растеж и обучение които ще намерим там; ние не бихме били склонни да действаме против законите и да си създаваме неприятности вследствие непознаването на тази страна; и поради много други подобни причини за нас би било от полза да знаем повече за тази страна. 

По-горе описаното илюстрира по подходящ начин нашата позиция относно Невидимите Светове. След смъртта ние ще се озовем там и ако сега можем да получим информация за условията там, това със сигурност ще ни помогне много. На първо място като преимущество е това, че познанието ще ни избави от страха, защото човек се страхува от това което не познава. На второ място, имайки познания за Чистилището и Първото Небе и за вечерното духовно тренировъчно упражнение, при което ние правим преглед на събитията през отминалия ден в обратен ред, ние може да преживеем нашето чистилище тук и в малки дози, получавайки опрощаване на греховете, вместо да чакаме изкупването на прегрешенията си; и ако се възползваме от нашето знание, ние ще живеем тук по начин който не бихме постигнали преди да навлезем в бъдещи животи, чрез асимилирането на доброто което сме направили всеки ден и изхвърляйки злото. Така ние ще бъдем в състояние да прелетим през Чистилището и Първото Небе веднага след смъртта. 

Знаейки какво очакваме да направим във Второто Небе, ние може по-разумно да се посветим на работата тук; ние си осигуряваме по-голяма способност за съзнателно съществуване в тази област, ако се запознаваме всеки ден все по- близо с нея. Така по различни начини, ние ще се подготвяме да станем невидими помощници, да живеем в съзнание през цялото време и да скъсим нашата еволюция с милиони години. 

### <h3 id="question-47">ВЪПРОС No.47</h3>

Има ли по някакъв начин зададена продължителност на времето за земния живот преди да се родим? 

Отговор: Да, по времето когато Его идва за прераждане, той си създава работещ архетип на своята физическа форма във Второто Небе с помощта на Творчески Йерархии. Този архетип е вибриращо нещо, което се стартира от Его и се зарежда с определена енергия съответстваща на продължителността на живота който трябва да се преживее на земята и докато този архетип продължава да вибрира, формата, изградена от земни химически съставни части ще продължава да живее. 

Законът за причинно-следствената връзка, обаче, е арбитър за това как ще трябва да се изживее живота и определени възможности за духовен растеж са заложени и предоставени на Его в различни моменти от неговия земен живот. Ако той е оползотворил тези възможности, животът продължава по правия път, но ако не, той се отклонява, както се казва, по задънена улица където живота се прекратява от Творческите Йерархии които унищожават архетипа в Небесния Свят. Следователно, можем да кажем, че е зададена една крайна продължителност на земния живот преди да се родим физически, но живота може да бъде съкратен ако пренебрегнем определени предоставени ни възможности. Също така, има и други случаи, много рядко срещащи се, когато животът е бил изживян напълно, когато е бил интензивен и когато човек е полагал усилия да изживее докрай всички заложени възможности, тогава е бил вливан повече живот в първоначално направения архетип и така животът може да бъде удължен, но както се спомена, това са само изключения. 

### <h3 id="question-48">ВЪПРОС No.48</h3>

Възможно ли е да се съкрати времето между смъртта и новото раждане, за да се ускори еволюцията на човек, и ако е възможно, как може да стане това? 

Отговор: Да, възможно е за всеки който ще положи усилия да направи преглед на живота си всеки ден, в обратен ред, от вечерта към сутринта, осъждайки се за нещата които е направил погрешно, обещавайки си че ще поправи грешките си и всичко това го прави най-добросъвестно. Ако прави това, той ще изчиства греховете които е сторил през живота си и ще стане със сигурност много по-добър мъж или по-добра жена, от тези които не изпълняват това просто упражнение. Защото греховете, които иначе биха се изкупили в Чистилището, вече са ликвидирани по време на живота, съществуването в Чистилището ще бъде съкратено значително. Ако по време на това вечерно духовно упражнение, човек преглежда и доброто което е сторил и си обещава, че ще се старае да прави дори повече добро в бъдеще, тогава той ще е асимилирал сторените от него добрини всеки ден и затова той ще е направил изключително големи крачки по пътя на душевния растеж, така че ще отстрани необходимостта от съществуване на Първото Небе. Такъв човек, определено ще е стъпил на пътя на посвещаването; той наистина е извън обикновените закони които управляват човешкия род, защото той е помощник в еволюцията и затова ще му бъде дадена възможността да се върне на земята много по-скоро. 

### <h3 id="question-49">ВЪПРОС No.49</h3>

Има ли някакви сезони и времена, векове и епохи в другия свят? 

Отговор: Не. Можем да кажем, че там всичко е само един дълъг ден. Там няма време, защото това което предизвиква наличието на време тук е въртенето на земята около оста й и нейното кръгово движение в орбита около слънцето. Тези движения пораждат деня и нощта, лятото и зимата, горещината и студа и т.н. защото непрозрачната и твърда конструкция на земята я прави непроницаема за лъчите от светлина и топлина емитирани от слънцето, така че едната половина от земята е студена и тъмна. Но защото нищо не е непрозрачно и твърдо в другия свят, там няма нито горещина нито студ, там няма нито лято нито зима, там няма светлина, там няма нощ, там е един дълъг бляскав ден. 

Затова често се случва, тези които са си отишли след смъртта, въпреки че напълно си спомнят своя преминал земен живот, не ще имат никакво чувство за време откакто са починали и може понякога да задават въпрос за това колко време е минало от както се е случило това събитие. 

Там има само един начин за измерване на времето и той се използва от опитния ясновидец за определяне на момента когато са се случили определени събития. А именно, той чете паметта на природата чрез астрологията, определяйки позициите на звездите. Разбира се, ако събитието се е случило отдавна назад в историята, той може лесно да фиксира годината като се базира на друго историческо събитие станало по същото време, но когато той трябва да се върне назад за много хиляди години, когато например, той желае да определи времето на потопите през Атлантската Епоха, практически той използва прецесията на равноденствията, което е всъщност движението на слънцето назад през дванадесетте знаци на Зодиака, движение на което е необходимо около двадесет и шест хиляди години за да направи слънцето пълен кръг. Тогава той може да определи времето когато са станали потопите през Атлантската Епоха, преброявайки колко на брой такива 26 000 годишни цикъла са се изпълнили между първия и втория потоп, между втория и третия, и годините от тогава до настоящето време. Ако той не е запознат с науката за звездите, той не би могъл да направи това, така че това е още една причина за това, ученикът на окултизма да се запознае с астрономията. 

### <h3 id="question-50">ВЪПРОС No.50</h3>

Дали човек, който е бил погребан жив осъзнава това? И дали духът се връща в тялото, когато то лежи в гроба? 

Отговор: Промяната на положението на тялото в гроба може да се приеме като доказателство за това, че понякога когато тялото е погребано преди духът да го е напуснал напълно, духът се е върнал в тялото и е движил това тяло в агония за да поеме глътка въздух. И, разбира се, това показва че човек е дошъл отново в съзнание. Духът, разбира се, съвсем не е възпрепятстван от твърдостта на земната материя и от ковчега, за да влезе и излезе, духът преминава през непроницаеми и плътни прегради както ние преминаваме през въздуха.

Защо умират деца? 

Отговор: Има много причини за смъртта на деца. Ние ще представим само няколко от основните. На първо място, когато един Его се връща към живот на земята, той е привлечен към определено семейство защото там ще може да намери външни условия които са разчетени да допринесат за неговия прогрес и където той ще може да ликвидира определено количество съдба, създадена от него самия в предишни съществувания. Тогава, ако родителите предприемат толкова радикални промени в техния живот, че Его да не е в състояние да получи този жизнен опит или да ликвидира тази съдба, Его обикновено бива изтеглян и изпращан на друго място където ще получи необходимите условия за своя растеж през този период. Или може да бъде изтеглен за няколко години и прероден в същото семейство, ако се прецени, че нужните условия ще са налични по-късно. Но има една причина отговорна за детската смъртност, чиято основа се намира много по-далече в миналото. А именно, в предишни животи и за да се разбере тази причина е необходимо да се знае нещо за това какво се случва по време на смъртта и веднага след нея. 

Когато един дух напуска тялото, той взима със себе си тялото на желанията, ума и виталното тяло, а виталното тяло по това време е мястото където се съхраняват картините* от изминалия живот. Те тогава се отпечатват* върху тялото на желанията през трите и половина дни непосредствено следващи след смъртта. Тогава тялото на желанията става арбитър на съдбата на човек в Чистилището и на Първото Небе. Болките причинени от изкупването на злото и радостта причинена от прегледа на доброто през живота се пренасят в следващия живот като съвест, която да възпира човека от повтарянето на грешките от миналите животи и да го привлича към действия които са му причинявали голямо щастие в предишните животи. 

() - *картини от изминалия живот – всички събития като поредица от изображения, понеже се явяват пред вътрешното зрение т.е. информацията за съдържанието на изминалия живот.

() - ’’ engrave ‘’ – гравирам*, врязвам, отпечатвам или запомням в информационен носител.   

Когато близките на умиращия човек, които са при неговото смъртно ложе, избухват в истерични вопли когато духът ги напуска и продължават така през следващите няколко дена, духът, който по това време е в изключително близка връзка с Физическия Свят, ще бъде силно разстроен от скръбта на близките си и няма да може да фокусира силно вниманието си върху прегледа на своя изминал живот и затова направения отпечатък върху тялото на желанията няма да бъде така дълбок и отчетлив, както ако отиващият си дух би бил оставен на тишина и спокойствие. В следствие на това, страданията в Чистилището няма да бъдат така силни, нито пък удовлетворението на Първо Небе няма да бъде така голямо, отколкото биха могли да бъдат и затова, когато Его се върне за земен живот, той ще е изгубил значителна част от своя опит от предишния си живот. С други думи, гласът на съвестта няма да звучи със същата сила, както ако Его беше оставен на спокойствие без да бъде смущаван от оплаквания. 

За да се компенсира тази липса, Его тогава обикновено се изпраща да се роди сред същите близки хора, които са го оплаквали, и след това им е отнеман още в детските си години. Тогава той прекрачва в Света на Желанията, но защото разбира се, едно малко дете не е извършило никакъв грях който трябва да бъде изкупван, неговите тяло на желанията и ум остават непокътнати; тогава той преминава директно на Първо Небе за да чака сгоден случай за ново въплътяване, но това време на очакване се използва за да бъде обучаван директно за ефекта от различните емоции, и от двете, и от добро и от зло. И често някой роднина го посреща и се грижи за него, имайки за задача да го обучава на това което е пропуснал поради оплакването което същата тази личност си е позволила. Във всеки случай загубата е в голяма степен възстановена, така че когато детето се върне за втори живот, то ще има така пълен морален растеж, както би имало при нормални обстоятелства ако не е имало оплакване по време на смъртта. 

### <h3 id="question-52">ВЪПРОС No.52</h3>

Каква е причината за големия брой на смъртни случаи при новородените деца? 

Отговор: Когато човек преминава в отвъдното по време на смърт, той взима със себе си ума, тялото на желанията и виталното тяло, което мястото където се съхраняват картините от неговия отминал живот. И през трите и половина дни след смъртта тези картини се отпечатват върху тялото на желанията за да формират основата на живота на човек в Чистилището и на Първото Небе, където злото се изчиства и доброто се асимилира. Преживяното през живота се забравя, както забравяме процеса на научаване да пишем, но запазваме това умение. Така акумулираният екстракт от целия му натрупан опит, и от миналите животи на земята и от миналите съществувания в Чистилището и на различните Небесни нива, се съхранява от човек и представлява неговия складиран запас за следващото раждане. Болките, които е изтърпял, му говорят като глас на съвестта и доброто, което е направил, му придава все повече алтруистичен характер. 

И така, когато трите и половина дни непосредствено след смъртта са прекарани от човек при условията на тишина и спокойствие, той е в състояние да се концентрира в по-голяма степен върху отпечатването на изминалия си живот и отпечатъкът върху тялото на желанията ще бъде по-дълбок и по-отчетлив, отколкото ако е бил смущаван от истеричните вопли на неговите близки или по други причини. И след това, той ще изпитва много по-остро чувствата за добро или зло в Чистилището и на Първото Небе, и в следващите животи това остро чувство ще му говори по безпогрешен начин, но когато оплакванията на роднините му отвличат вниманието или когато човек умира при нещастен случай, може би на улица пълна с навалица, при катастрофа на влак, пожар в театър или при други ужасни обстоятелства, тогава, разбира се, няма да има възможност за нужната концентрация, също така няма да има възможност за концентрация на бойното поле, ако падне в бой там, и важното при тези случаи е следното: когато той би загубил опитността от изминалия живот който е приключил по такъв нещастен начин, тогава законът за причинно-следствената връзка предоставя компенсация. 

Ние обикновено си мислим, че когато детето се е родило, това е краят на процеса на раждане, но когато по време на вътреутробния период плътното тяло е защитено от въздействието на външния свят като е поставено в защитната среда на майката докато не е достигнало необходимата зрелост за да може да посрещне условията на външния свят, така също и виталното тяло, тялото на желанията и умът се намират в ембрионално състояние преди да се родят през по-късни периоди от време, защото те не са имали толкова продължителна еволюция зад гърба си както плътното тяло и затова на тях им е необходимо по- дълго време за да достигнат достатъчна зрялост за своята индивидуализация. Виталното тяло се ражда на седмата година, когато настъпва периодът на бърз растеж. Тялото на желанията се ражда когато настъпи периодът на пубертета, четиринадесетата година, и умът се ражда на двадесет и една, когато се казва че детето е станало мъж или жена – достигнало е зрялост. 

Това което не е било живо не може да умре, затова ако едно дете умре преди раждането на тялото на желанията, то преминава в невидимия свят на Първо Небе. То не може да премине на Второ и Трето Небе, защото умът и тялото на желанията не са били родени, затова то просто очаква нова възможност за въплътяване на Първо Небе и понеже човекът е умрял в предишния си живот при неблагоприятните обстоятелства споменати по-горе, при нещастен случай или на бойното поле или където оплакванията на близките са направили невъзможно за него да получи толкова дълбоко и отчетливо отпечатване на извършеното зло и на стореното добро, отколкото ако беше оставен да умре в мир, той, след като умре в последвалия живот като дете бива инструктиран за ефекта от страстите и желанията за да научи урока който би научил в Чистилището. След това се преражда с подходящо развита съвест, така че да може да продължи еволюцията си. 

Тъй като, в миналото човечеството е в воювало много и роднините на починалите никак не са били внимателни понеже не са знаели за последствията от бденията при смъртното ложе на хората умиращи в дом, които са били вероятно малко на брой, сравнявайки ги с броя на тези които са загинали по време на битка, съответно на това би трябвало да има много голям процент детска смъртност. Но човечеството достига по-високо ниво на разбиране, че най-силно се проявява братското чувство когато близкият ни човек си отива от този живот и когато ние можем изключително много да му помогнем като пазим тишина и се молим за душата му, така че детската смъртност ще престане да бъде такъв голям процент, както е понастоящем. 

### <h3 id="question-53">ВЪПРОС No.53</h3>

Дали кремирането на плътното тяло след смъртта се отразява по някакъв начин на духа? 

Отговор: Докато живее и е в будно състояние на съзнанието, всичките тела- носители на Его са заедно и концентрични едно спрямо друго, но при смърт Его, облечен в ума и тялото на желанията се измъква от плътното тяло и тъй като жизнените функции са към своя край, виталното тяло също се извлича от плътното тяло оставяйки го да лежи безжизнено. Една малка частица (атом) в сърцето се извлича и останалата част от тялото се разпада по съответния ред. Но по това време се извършва един изключително важен процес и тези които присъстват при смъртта до смъртното ложе трябва да бъдат много внимателни там да цари пълна тишина и в целия дом също, защото картините от целия изминал живот които са били съхранени във виталното тяло преминават пред погледа на духа в една бавна и подредена прогресия, в обратен ред, от смъртта назад до раждането. Тази панорама на изминалия живот се задържа в продължение на няколко часа до три и половина дни. Продължителността зависи от силата на виталното тяло, която определя колко дълго човек ще може да се задържи буден при най-жесток стрес. Някои хора могат да работят петдесет, шестдесет и седемдесет часа преди да паднат изтощени, докато други са в състояние да се задържат будни само за няколко часа. Причината за това да бъде пазена тишина в дома на смъртта през три и половина дни следващи непосредствено след смъртта е следната: през това време панорамата на изминалия живот се отпечатва върху тялото на желанията което ще бъде носителя на човека докато той пребивава в Чистилището и на Първото Небе, където той жъне доброто или злото което е посял, в зависимост от делата си в тялото. 

И така, там където животът е бил пълен със събития и виталното тяло на човека е силно, ще бъде дадено по-дълго време за това отпечатване, отколкото в условията на слабо витално тяло, но през цялото това време плътното тяло е свързано с по-висшите носители посредством сребърната нишка и всяко нараняване на плътното тяло се усеща в някаква степен от духа. Така че балсамиране, изследвания след смъртта и кремиране, всичко това се усеща. Затова те трябва да се избягват през първите три и половина дни след настъпването на смъртта, защото след като панорамата е била напълно отпечатана в тялото на желанията, тогава сребърната нишка се прекъсва, виталното тяло се връща и гравитира до плътното тяло и няма повече връзка с духа, който тогава е свободен да се отправи към своя по-висш живот. 

Когато тялото е погребано, виталното тяло бавно се разпада по едно и също време с плътното тяло, така че например когато една ръка се разложи в гроба, етерната ръка на виталното тяло която се рее над гроба също изчезва и така нататък докато изчезне и последната следа от тялото. Но там където е извършена кремация виталното тяло се унищожава веднага и понеже то е мястото където се съхраняват картините от изминалия живот, които бидейки отпечатани върху тялото на желанията ще формират базата на живота в Чистилището и на Първото Небе, това би било голяма катастрофа ако кремацията се извърши преди да са изминали трите и половина дни. Ако не му се помогне, отиващият си дух не би могъл да се справи. И това е част от работата която се извършва от невидимите помощници на човешкия род. Понякога на тях им асистират природни духове и понякога Творчески Йерархии или водачите на човечеството. Има загуба и когато някой е кремиран преди сребърната нишка да се прекъсне по естествен начин, тогава отпечатъкът върху тялото на желанията никога не е толкова дълбок и отчетлив и това има ефект върху бъдещите животи защото колкото е по-дълбок отпечатъкът върху тялото на желанията, толкова по-остро ще бъде страданието в Чистилището за стореното зло и толкова по-остро ще бъде, също така, и удоволствието на Първото Небе което е резултат от добрите дела през изминалия живот. Това са тези болки и удовлетворение от нашия изминал живот, които създават така наречената съвест, така че ако са ни липсвали страдания, ние губим разбирането на това кое е погрешно, а това разбиране ни възпира през бъдещите животи от повтарянето на същите грешки отново и отново. Така че, последствията от преждевременното кремиране са продължителни. Тъжно е да се каже, но докато ние имаме научен подход към раждането, което се извършва с помощта на специалисти, обучени медицински сестри, антисептици и всичко останало необходимо за доброто на идващото малко същество, на нас ни липсва научен подход към смъртта за да ни помогне да се грижим за близките ни хора когато си отиват от живота. 

### <h3 id="question-54">ВЪПРОС No.54</h3>

Ако човек е загубил паметта си поради нервен шок или заболяване, дали това се отразява върху неговото витално тяло и не му позволява да осъществи записа на неговия живот през трите дни следващи непосредствено след смъртта? 

Отговор: Не. Има три вида памет: на първо място, има запис който се прави от сетивните ни органи. Ние гледаме света около нас, ние виждаме и чуваме различни неща, тези въздействия се отпечатват върху клетките на нашия мозък и ние сме в състояние съзнателно да ги повикваме отново – е не винаги, но в различна степен, защото тази памет е изключително ненадеждна и капризна и ако това беше единствения начин за получаване на запис на нашия живот, законът за причинно-следствената връзка нямаше да действа – нашият отвъден живот нямаше да бъде следствие от това, какво сме били направили или не сме били направили в миналото. 

Трябва да има някакъв друг вид памет и това е, което учените наричат подсъзнание. Така както етерът провежда копие на околната панорама до камерата на фотографа и го отпечатва върху чувствителната плака до най-малката подробност, независимо от това дали фотографът възприема тези детайли или не, така същият етер, който провежда една картина до нашите очи и я отпечатва върху ретината, провежда подобна картина и до белите ни дробове, която след това се абсорбира в кръвта и тъй като кръвта преминава през сърцето, този запис се отпечатва незаличимо върху чувствителния семенен атом* който се намира в лявата камерата (ventricle) на сърцето близо до apex. Енергията на този семенен атом се извлича от духа по време на смъртта и съдържа записа на целия живот до най-малкия детайл, така че независимо от това дали сме възприели всички факти от дадена сцена или не, те са там. 

() - *‘’atom ‘’ – авторът използва този термин имайки пред вид вероятно ‘’частица’’ - atom/atoms са преведени на повечето места като атом/атоми, но биха могли да означават и частица/и (в общия случай), атом/и, молекула/и, тъкан/и и т.н. или информационен носител/и.  

George du Maurier е написал разказ със заглавие ‘’Peter Ibbetson‘’, където е изложена много ясно тази идея за подсъзнателната памет. ’Peter Ibbetson, затворник в английски изправителен дом, се научил как да ‘’сънува истината’’, с други думи, поставяйки тялото си в определено положение, той се научил как да затваря токовете на етера вътре в себе си, така че през нощта той е можел по желание да поддържа контакт с всяка сцена, която си поиска от своя предишен живот; там той е можел да се вижда като действащо лице (възрастен мъж какъвто е бил) до своите родители и другари в игрите заобиколен от всичко както е било по времето когато тази сцена се е отпечатала. Той е можел да вижда цялата сцена с много повече детайли, отколкото е бил в състояние да възприеме по времето когато това се е било случило в материалния свят. Всичко това е било възможно защото при тези обстоятелства той е можел да влиза в контакт със своята собствена подсъзнателна памет. Той не би могъл да получи никаква информация относно бъдещето, но миналото е било записано върху пластинка (диск…) в неговото сърце и, поради това, той е можел да има достъп до него при определени условия. Подсъзнателната памет е тази, от която се взима записът на живота след смъртта и понеже този запис зависи само от дишането, той се осъществява независимо от всички обстоятелства докато животът е в тялото, и въпреки че човек може да загуби съзнателната си памет и да не бъде в състояние да си спомня минали събития когато пожелае, те всички се съдържат в подсъзнателната памет и могат да бъдат прочетени от там в подходящо време.

Ако невъплътен дух може да премине през стена, може ли той също да преминава през планини и през земята, и може ли да вижда какво има вътре в нея? 

Отговор: Зависи от това, какъв невъплътен дух задаващият въпроса има пред вид. Когато един човек умре, той остава точно същия какъвто е бил преди, с изключение на това, че няма плътно тяло и затова за него е напълно възможно да преминава през стени или планини. Но той не е в състояние да преминава през земята. 

Добре известен факт е, че повечето ясновидци и обикновените екстрасенси могат да кажат много за това как изглежда Света на Желанията, но има много малко налична информация касаеща вътрешността на земята, защото обикновените ясновидци са открили, че ако се опитат да проникнат в земята, се получава същия ефект както човек се блъска в стена. Това е така, защото земята е тяло на велик дух и този дух не може да бъде доближен в неговата вътрешна същност по друг начин освен по пътя на посвещаването. Около ядрото на земята има девет слоя с различна плътност, ядрото представлява десетата част, и Lesser Mysteries са вратата която води до най-вътрешната част – ядрото. Има девет степени в По- малките Мистерии и на всяка степен кандидатът придобива способността да проникне в съответния земен слой, докато десетото Посвещаване принадлежи на Големите(или Великите) Мистерии, където има четири нива. Първото учи на всичко това, което ще се знае от човечеството през Земния Период; второто от великите посвещавания ще му даде знанията които човечеството ще придобие в края на Юпитеровия Период; третото от великите посвещавания би му дала мъдростта която човечеството ще придобие в края на Венериния Период и четвъртото би завършило неговата еволюция по сегашната схема. Той би бил в същото състояние в каквото човечеството би било в края на Вулкановия Период. Тогава той би знаел всичко което земята съдържа в своето тяло и нейното бъдещо проявление. По-малките Мистерии, също така, биха го запознали с еволюцията която той е изминал през трите периода предхождащи нашия сегашен Земен Период. Това са тайните заключени в земята докато човек не си отвори сам вратата по необходимия начин, така че нито един дух, независимо от това дали е в тяло или не, не може да види какво има във вътрешността на земята, докато вратата на посвещаването не е отворила неговите латентни способности.

Дали срещаме нашите близки хора след смъртта, дори ако те са имали различна от нашата вяра? Или, може би, са били атеисти? 

Отговор: Да, със сигурност ги срещаме и ги познаваме, защото в смъртта няма трансформираща сила. Човек ще изглежда точно по същия начин както изглежда тук, защото той мисли за себе си че е оформен така, но мястото където ще се срещнем зависи от няколко неща. 

На първо място, ако сме водили силно религиозен начин на живот, така че да нямаме никакво съществуване в чистилището преминавайки почти директно на Второто Небе, докато този когото сме обичали е бил такава личност, че ще му е необходим дълъг престой в Света на Желанията, тогава разбира се, ние няма да се срещнем докато той не пристигне на Второ Небе. Ако ние умрем скоро след нашия приятел, срещата няма да се осъществи може би двадесет години; но това няма значение понеже в тези области човек е напълно несъзнателен относно времето. 

Приятелят материалист, ако е водил високо морален начин на живот, както обикновено се случва при тези хора, би се задържал в четвъртата област на Света на Желанията за определен брой години, в съответствие на продължителността на живота който е изживял и след това би преминал на Второ Небе, но той не би имал там така пълно и съвършено съзнание както притежаваното от човек който е живял съобразно истините на живота. 

Ние ще го виждаме, ще го познаваме и ще бъдем свързани с него за векове в работата върху бъдещата околна среда и там той въобще няма да бъде материалист, защото когато духът пристигне в тази висша област той не е завладян от илюзиите в които понякога е обгърнат тук, в този материален свят. Всеки се осъзнава като духовно същество и усеща спомена за този земен живот както ние си спомняме лош сън. Във всеки случай, духът, след като навлезе в онзи свят, се събужда за своята истинска същност. 

### <h3 id="question-57">ВЪПРОС No.57</h3>

Дали познаваме близките си, които са преминали през портата на смъртта? 

Отговор: Да, със сигурност.Когато човек напусне това тяло той остава съвършено същия както е бил преди. Няма въобще никаква разлика, с изключение на това, че той няма физическо тяло; той се озовава в Света на Желанията и понеже съхранява в своето съзнание образ за себе си както е изглеждал тук, тялото на желанията веднага заема формата на физическото тяло, така че всеки който го е познавал през земния живот, ще го познае също и след като е преминал отвъд. Обаче, може би е добре да се добави, че не съществува никаква трансформираща сила в смъртта – че човек, следователно, е душевно и морално същата личност. Ние често чуваме хората да говорят за някого когото са обичали и който е починал, като за отишлия си ангел дори когато си дават сметка, че той по-скоро е бил дявол тук през земния си живот, но обикновено те мислят че е непочтително да се го споменават по този начин. Въпреки това, фактът си е факт, само тези които са били добри тук, са добри и там. 

### <h3 id="question-58">ВЪПРОС No.58</h3>

Дали човек който се е самоубил стои по-дълго в Чистилището, отколкото хората които са умрели от естествена смърт? 

Отговор: Когато Его слиза надолу за прераждане, той се спуска през Второто Небе. Там Творческите (Създаващи) Йерархии му помагат да си построи архетип за бъдещото тяло и той вгражда в този архетип живот, който ще продължи до определен брой години. Тези архетипове са кухи пространства и имат пеещо вибриращо движение, което привлича материя от Физическия Свят в тях и привежда в трептене всички атоми (частици) на тялото в синхрон с една малка частица която се намира в сърцето и се нарича семенен атом, който като камертон дава тон на целия останал веществен материал в тялото. Когато целия живот на земята е бил изживян, вибрациите на архетипа се прекратяват, семенният атом е извлечен, плътното тяло започва да се разпада и тялото на желанията в което Его функционира в Чистилището и на Първо Небе приема формата на физическото тяло. Тогава човек започва своята работа за изчистване на лошите си морални качества и дела в Чистилището и за асимилиране на доброто от своя живот на Първото Небе. 

Горното описва нормалните обстоятелства, когато хода на природните процеси е ненарушен. Но случаят на самоубийство е по-различен. Самоубиецът е извлякъл семенния атом, но кухият архетип все още продължава да вибрира. Затова той се чувства така, като че ли е бил изтърбушен и усеща гризящо чувство вътре в себе си, което най-добре може да се оприличи на острата болка при силен глад. Материя за строеж на плътно тяло има навсякъде около него, но на него му липсва матрицата на семенния атом и затова не му е възможно да асимилира тази материя и да я оформи в тяло. Това ужасно чувство на изпразненост продължава толкова дълго, колкото би била продължителността на живота му. Така законът за причинно-следствената връзка го учи, че е грешно да бяга от училището на живота и че това не може да се прави безнаказано. Тогава, през следващия живот, когато трудности се изпречат на пътя му, той ще помни страданията от миналото които са в резултат от самоубийството и ще преминава през трудностите с опитността която работи за духовния растеж.

Трябва ли един добър човек да мине през Чистилището и да бъде свидетел на целия ужас там, преди да може да достигне до Първото, Второто и Третото Небе? И ако е така, не ли това едно незаслужено наказание за него? 

Отговор: Задаващият въпроса трябва да се откаже от идеята за наказание. Няма такова нещо като наказание. Всичко което се случва на човек е в съответствие с неизменните непроменящи се закони и няма такава персона Бог, който награждава или наказва по негова преценка съобразно волята му, непонятна за нас, или по някакъв друг подобен начин. Когато Его се облича в тела или когато се отърсва от своите тела-носители, това става според същия принцип, според същите закони които управляват например планетите. Когато една планета е била оформена от централната огнена мъгла, било е осъществено кристализиране в областта на полюсите където движението е най-бавно. Кристализиралата материя е била изхвърлена посредством центробежната сила и лети в пространството защото е по-тежка от останалата огнена мъгла. По същата причина когато тялото на духа което е най-плътно е изкристализирало до такава степен и е станало толкова тежко, че духът не може повече да го използва за да натрупва опитност, процесът на събличане се осъществява от центробежната сила, която естествено елиминира първо плътното тяло. Това е което ние наричаме смърт. Тогава духът е свободен за известно време, но най-грубата и долнокачествена материя на желанията, която е била въплъщение на най-ниските страсти и желания също трябва да бъде изхвърлена и това е принудително изхвърляне на низките желания което причинява болка в Чистилището където центробежната сила на неприемане и отблъскване е най-мощна. Ако човек има само от тази груба материя в тялото на желанията, естествено той трябва да стои в Чистилището и да бъде подложен на процеса на пречистване преди да може да влезе в Първото Небе. Там центростремителната сила на привличане завихря и увлича всичко добро от живота навътре към центъра на духа, където то се асимилира като душевна сила и е на разположение на духа за следващия земен живот. Така че, нашето пребиваване в Чистилището зависи от това колко от грубата материя на желанията има човек, а един добър човек естествено ще има много малко или никаква от този вид. Затова, може да се каже, че той няма да има живот в Чистилището; той би преминал директно през тези области в Небесния Свят. 

### <h3 id="question-60">ВЪПРОС No.60</h3>

Какво е състоянието на жертвата на убийство и на жертвата на случайна злополука след смъртта? 

Отговор: Няма такова нещо като случайност, поне когато става въпрос за злополука с фатален край. Крайната продължителност на живота на всеки човек обикновено е фиксирана преди раждането, но има определени пунктове през живота когато човек се озовава на нещо като кръстопът, когато пред него са дадени определени възможности за растеж, които той може или да приеме или да отхвърли. Когато той пропусне да използва тези възможности, животът продължава напред в задънена улица и се прекратява скоро след това. 

Това, обаче, обикновено не е причината за нещастен случай, а може да са на лице определени причини които правят желателно отстраняването на човек от неговото тяло по насилствен начин. След като това се случи, той се намира в същото състояние както всички други които са умрели; той започва своето съществуване в Чистилището веднага. 

Случаят на жертвата на убийство, подобно на случая на самоубийство, е различен. Човек, благодарение на своята божествена същност, е единственото създание което има изключителното право да предизвиква нарушения в порядъка на схемата (или плана) на своето развитие и тъй като той може да прекрати живота си с един акт на свята воля, така също може да прекрати живота на друго създание от своя вид преди да е дошло неговото време. Каквото страдание ще последва след самоубийство, същото страдание ще има и за убития, защото архетипът на неговото тяло ще продължи да натрупва вещества за регенерация които той не би могъл да усвои; но в този случай намесата на други същества предотвратява страданието и той се намира в своето тяло на желанията реейки се в състояние на коматоза за продължителност от време равна на продължителността на остатъка от живота му. Ако убиецът е бил подведен под наказателна отговорност и осъден на смърт, силата на магнитното привличане ще го събере с неговата жертва която непрекъснато ще се намира пред погледа му и това е наистина много по-тежко наказание от всичко което би могло да се измисли; но жертвата не усеща по никакъв начин присъствието на убиеца си. 

### <h3 id="question-61">ВЪПРОС No.61</h3>

Къде е Небесният Свят? (Раят)? 

Отговор: Христос е казал ‘’Небесата са вътре в нас’’ и на нас ни е показано, че когато Той напуска своите ученици, Той се възнася на Небето. За да разберем това, ние трябва да анализираме състава на една планета и съгласно херметическия принцип ‘’каквото горе, такова и долу’’, ние ще разберем предмета по-добре ако първо разгледаме от какво се състои човек. 

Човек, на първо място, има плътно тяло което виждаме с очите си, но това плътно тяло не е толкова компактно както изглежда, факт е че то е проникнато от няколко невидими тела. То е съставено от вещества в твърдо агрегатно състояние, от течности и газове, намиращи се в химическата област, но те, според научното обяснение, са проникнати от етер защото човешкото тяло не е по-различно от всички други неща на света, а и в най-плътното вещество и в най- редкия газ, според научното обяснение което е вярно, всеки малък атом вибрира в море от етер. Този етер все още е физическа материя, една определена част от етера е обособена от човек и оформя едно точно копие на нашето плътно тяло, което се издава на около четири сантиметра извън периферията на нашето видимо тяло. Това е тази част, която докторите в Бостън са премерили поставяйки умиращи хора на везни. Те са обърнали внимание на факта, че когато последният дъх се отделя, нещо което има тегло напуска тялото и за безкрайно учудване, везните го отчели. Вестникарските репортери твърдели, че докторите са измерили душата, но това което те са измерили е било това витално тяло съставено от етер което напуска тялото при смъртта. 

Ние имаме и още по-ефирно тяло, наречено тяло на желанията, което е съставено от това което окултистите наричат вещество на желанията и което може да бъде видяно, от някой който има шесто чувство, разпростиращо се като облак с формата на яйце обгръщайки плътното тяло от всички страни, така че то се намира в центъра на тялото на желанията както жълтъкът се намира в центъра на яйцето, с единствената разлика, че белтъкът обгръща жълтъка но не го прониква, докато това тяло на желанията прониква и двете, и виталното и плътното тела абсолютно навсякъде. Има и още по-фина материя в строежа на човек, която бихме могли да наречем ‘’умствено вещество’’, съставена от най-грубата материя на света на мисълта, материята в която ние формираме нашите конкретни мисли, и тя обгръща вътре живеещият Его. 

Светът е конструиран по подобен начин. Освен този видим свят, който възприемаме с очите си, съставен от твърди тела, течности и газове и проникнат от етер, има още и Свят на Желанията който обхваща всяка част от Физическия Свят и се разпростира в пространството отвъд въздуха и етера. След това има и Свят на Мисълта, който също прониква всяка част от нашата планета, от центъра до периферията, достигайки в пространството още по-далеч отколкото който и да е от останалите светове. 

През земния живот, човек живее в този твърд, видим свят, но след смъртта, съответно на извършените дела в тялото, той може да е все още затворен тук, тъй като областите на чистилището са тук навсякъде около нас и при нас, също и под нас във вътрешните пространства на земята.Първото Небе е също тук, в известен смисъл, доколкото подобна материя на тази от която то е съставено има около нас, но самото Първо Небе, мястото в което обикновено се намират освободените духове, е отвъд нашата атмосфера. Второто Небе, също би било вярно да се каже че е около нас, защото материята от която е съставено е тук и духовете които са там биха могли да ни посещават, но условията тук, мисловните токове и т.н. биха били във вреда на тяхната активност и развитие. Затова те предпочитат да стоят в най-отдалечената и най-външната част на нашата планета където чистата мисловна материя е неопетнена от нашите егоистични и вредни мисловни токове. 

Третото Небе е мястото където много малко хора при сегашното ниво на развитие имат някакво съзнание, защото повечето от нас се ръководят в мисловната си дейност повече от емоции и чувства имащи отношение към конкретни неща, отколкото към абстрактни мисли, което е особеното качество характерно за Третото Небе. Когато ние мислим за любов, обикновено това е любов към конкретен човек, това е конкретна мисъл. Но за любов в абстрактния смисъл, много малко от нас са в състояние да мислят. Ние можем да мислим за къща, за животно и т.н. това са конкретни мисли, но ние не обичаме да мислим за абстрактна пропорция например – че квадратът на хипотенузата е равен на сумата от квадратите на другите две страни на триъгълника. Поради това, много малко от нас са в някаква степен на съзнание на Третото Небе и съответно много малко количество от материята на този свят се съдържа в конструкцията на нашата планета. 

### <h3 id="question-62">ВЪПРОС No.62</h3>

Казано е, че на небето няма мъка, но ако се срещнем с нашите близки там и след това те си отидат, няма ли раздялата с тях да предизвика поне някакво чувство на неудовлетворение? 

Отговор: Не, няма, защото там ние виждаме и разбираме нещата такива каквито са. Тук сме заслепени. Когато един Его идва във Физическия Свят, това е от една страна повод за радост, както ние се радваме при раждането на едно дете, защото този свят ни дава опитност и материал за душевен растеж. Но ако погледнем на това от друга гледна точка, когато Его идва на този свят и влиза в затвора на плътното тяло, той се озовава в условията на най-голямо ограничение, които можем да си представим. И да се радваме когато дете се роди и да плачем когато то се освобождава със смъртта е наистина все едно да се радваме когато един приятел бива затворен в затвор и да го оплакваме когато е освободен от затвора. 

Когато духът преминава в Небесните Светове, той се среща с много от тези с които е бил обвързан през земния живот на Първото Небе, но понеже той вече е станал толкова одухотворен и е толкова близо до истинската реалност, той знае че смърт няма.Затова, когато някой скъп за нас човек премине в отвъдното, това е радостно събитие и знаейки че отново ще се срещнем със сигурност ще отнеме болката от тези които остават тук. 

### <h3 id="question-63">ВЪПРОС No.63</h3>

Моля обяснете как да прилагаме концентрацията за да помогнем на тези които са на другия свят. Дали вие имате пред вид да седим мълчаливо и да излъчваме мисли за обич и подкрепа към тях? 

Отговор: Способността да се излъчва мисъл и силата с която тази мисъл трябва да реализира това за което е била изпратена, зависи от това, до каква степен мислителят е способен да визуализира това което трябва да се реализира. Обикновено окултните школи, преди всичко тези принадлежащи към източната традиция, препоръчват метода на концентрация, при който мислите се концентрират в една точка, както слънчевите лъчи се концентрират преминавайки през лупа, при което силата им нараства максимално и както слънчевите лъчи ще бъдат запалителни когато са концентрирани, така мисълта ще реализира обекта си след като е била концентрирана до необходимата интензивност. 

Необходими са продължителни упражнения, обаче, преди да може да се постигне това и има много малко хора на Запад които са в състояние да използват мислите си с всякакъв вид предназначение. Западната религия, признавайки тази невъзможност, дава друг метод който е много по-ефикасен от концентрацията, а именно – молитвата. 

Затова, ако искаме да помогнем на тези които са напуснали тялото си ние можем да се помолим искрено те да се чувстват добре и да усвоят успешно уроците от земния живот чрез преживяванията им в Чистилището и на Първото Небе; по този начин ще постигнем повече отколкото ако използваме студения, мисловен метод на концентрацията. Положението на тялото понякога е от голямо значение за интензивността на молитвата и ако позицията на колене ни се струва че улеснява целта й, трябва да коленичим. От друга страна, както казва Емерсон: 

```
‘’И въпреки че твоите колене никога не се прегъват   
Пред Небето, твоите молитви са изпратени;   
И дали са за добро или за зло   
Те вече са приети и им е даден отговор.’’   
```

Така че, положението на тялото по време на молитва не е от значение, освен когато на човек му се струва че е важно за постигане на най-голяма интензивност на съдържанието на молитвата, защото това е което прави молитвата действаща. 

### <h3 id="question-64">ВЪПРОС No.64</h3>

Дали тези които са напуснали земния живот се грижат за нас и ни закрилят, нас които сме останали тук; например, дали майките се грижат за малките си деца или дори за вече порасналите? 

Отговор: Да, много често една майка която наскоро е починала ще се грижи за своето малко дете дълго време, даже има документирани примери за това как майки са спасили своите дечица от опасност. Въпреки че са знаели как съзнателно да се материализират, любовта към малките и силният страх за тяхната сигурност са карали майките от споменатите по-горе примери, да привличат към себе си материя, така че да могат да бъдат видени от децата.Тези които наричаме мъртви, обикновено след погребението не се отдалечават от дома в който са живели в продължение на достатъчно дълго време. Те стоят в стаите с които са свикнали и се движат сред нас, въпреки че ние не ги виждаме. Разбира се, когато настъпи моментът те да отидат на Първото Небе, те напускат нашите домове, но често се връщат за да ги посещават. Когато след време те встъпват във Второто Небе, те вече на са в съзнание за това физическо ниво, в смисъл да имат дом или приятели или роднини; тогава те би трябвало да се възприемат по скоро като природни сили, защото те работят за земята и хората по подобен начин както природните сили които не приемат човешко въплъщение. 

Поради това, напълно вярно е, че те се грижат за своите близки през дълъг период от време след като са починали, и често се споменава от хора които са присъствали при смъртта на една майка чиито деца са умрели, може би няколко години преди това, че когато умира тя вижда децата до леглото си и извиква: ‘’О, ето го Джони, колко много е пораснал, какво голямо момче е станал.’’ и т.н. Хората при нея вероятно ще помислят, че това са халюцинации, но не са, и трябва да се отбележи че съществува един феномен предизвикващ тези видения, а именно, когато човек умира към него се приближава тъмнина, която той усеща че се спуска върху него. Много хора преминават в отвъдното без да видят отново Физическия Свят. Това е ефектът от промяната на вибрациите на нашата светлина към вибрациите на Света на Желанията и е подобно на тъмнината която се е разпростряла върху света по време на Разпятието. При други хора се случва тъмнината да се повдигне за момент и тогава човекът става ясновидец виждайки и двата свята: този свят и Света на Желанията. И тогава, разбира се, се появяват близките които са привлечени от предстоящата смърт, която всъщност е раждане за техния свят. 

Следователно, можем да кажем, че са заинтересувани за нашето благополучие дълго време след като са починали, но трябва да се има пред вид, че няма трансформираща сила в смъртта; така че тя не им дава някакви специални възможности да се грижат за нас и че те нямат никакво намерение да се намесват в делата ни, така че не е правилно да ги възприемаме като ангели хранители. Те, по-скоро са наблюдатели, с изключение на много малко на брой специфични случаи, когато силната любов ги прави способни да извършат несъществени действия в случай на голяма необходимост. Тези действия, обаче, никога няма да бъдат насочени към това, да ни помогнат да забогатеем или нещо подобно, те са действия за предпазване от голяма опасност или нещо подобно. 

<h2 id="section-3">РАЗДЕЛ III: Въпроси отнасящи се до ПРЕРАЖДАНЕ</h2>

### <h3 id="question-65">ВЪПРОС No.65</h3>

Защо, с малко на брой изключения, се прераждаме без да имаме и най-малкото понятие за което и да е предишно съществуване, да страдаме през настоящия живот без да знаем защо за прегрешения извършени през някой предишен живот, за който сега нищо не знаем? Не бихме ли напреднали в духовното си развитие по-добре и по-бързо, ако знаехме къде сме сгрешили преди и какво да коригираме в нашите действия за да осъществим прогрес? 

Отговор: Човек е благословен да не знае предишните си преживявания преди да е постигнал значим напредък в духовното си развитие, защото в предишните ни животи (когато сме били много по-примитивни)има тъмни дела които зоват за възмездие, а тази карма е в процес на постепенно ликвидиране, така че ако знаем как сме живели преди, ако знаем как и кога законът за причинно-следствената връзка ще ни донесе заслуженото наказание за предишни прегрешения, ние бихме видели това надвиснало бедствие да се рее над нас и страхът от съдбата ни ще ни отнеме силата да се борим с нея и когато времето й настъпи, ще бъдем ужасени и безпомощни. 

От друга страна, незнаейки какво е било зад нас, ще избегнем знанието за това какво е пред нас и затова ще учим уроците без страхът да ни направи безсилни. Впрочем, за тези които имат желание да знаят, има начин да разберат какви уроци трябва да научат и как най-добре да ги научат. Например, нашата съвест ни казва какво да правим и какво не. Ако желаем да изучаваме науката астрология, хороскопът ни показва нашите тенденции и линиите на най-малкото съпротивление, така че работейки съобразно тези природни закони, ние ще можем да напреднем бързо; колкото повече се подчиняваме на това което ни диктува съвестта, колкото повече имаме желание да опознаваме природните закони които астрономията ни разкрива, толкова по-бързо ще се подготвим за знанието от първа ръка. 

В ‘’Занони’’, Bulwer Lytton разказва за един ужасяващ призрак, който се изпречва пред Glyndon когато той се опитва да направи крачка напред в развитието си на ново ниво, и който се нарича в окултизма ‘’Обитателят на границата’’. Между смъртта и новото раждане, този живеещ на прага не може да се види от човек, но това е въплъщението на всичките ни минали зли дела, които трябва да бъдат отминати от този който иска да влезе в отвъдните светове в съзнание и да опознае напълно условията там. Но има, също така, и друг обитател, който е въплъщението на всички наши добри дела и за който може да се каже че е нашият Ангел Хранител. 

Ако имаме смелостта да загърбим ужасния, който първи се възприема защото е изграден от грубата материя на Света на Желанията, скоро след това ще получим съзнателната помощ от другия и тогава ще имаме силата да стоим без страх пред нападките срещу всички които стъпват на пътя на антисебичността. Но преди да сме отминали този призрак, ние не сме готови за знанието за нашите предишни животи; ние трябва да се задоволим с това което се открива пред обикновения човек. 

### <h3 id="question-66">ВЪПРОС No.66</h3>

Дали всички човешки същества, хората които сега населяват земята, са били души които са преминали през земен живот преди, или през цялото време биват създавани нови души? 

Отговор: Процесът на достъп на духове в човешките тела, така като тялото е изградено сега, е бил осъществен през етапа на втвърдяване на земята, наречен Лемурианска Епоха и не е бил завършен до средата на Атлантската Епоха, период от време с продължителност, вероятно, милиони години. Но от тогава, достъп повече не е разрешен, вратата определено е затворена защото ние сега сме еволюирали толкова напред, че тези които още не са достигнали нивото на което могат да манипулират сегашното човешко тяло, са твърде далече назад зад нас, за да могат да наваксат изоставането и да се справят с по-нататъчното развитие. От това време до сега, духовете които са били въплътени в човешки форми са еволюирали чрез повтарящи се въплъщения така, че без изключение, всяко едно човешко същество сега на земята се е въплътило по различно време и при различни условия на околната среда. 

### <h3 id="question-67">ВЪПРОС No.67</h3>

Защо трябва да знаем без съмнение, че прераждането е факт? Не е ли възможно, тези които твърдят това да страдат от халюцинации? 

Отговор: Опитният ясновидец, който е в състояние да чете в паметта на природата, може да проследява живота на хора от тяхното настояще назад достигайки годините на детството. След това той може да ги види като кърмачета, ще ги следва през периода на ембрионалното развитие до времето когато духът влиза в утробата на майката. Той би могъл да се върне през техния небесен живот в Чистилището, достигайки до времето на смъртта на техния предишен живот, да го проследи назад и да види целия живот. Но, ако става въпрос за възрастен човек, изминалото време е обикновено хиляда години и повече, и разбира се, ако няма други източници за сравнение, това би могло да приеме за халюцинация. Когато става въпрос за деца, обаче, които не са достигнали пубертет, интервалът между две инкарнации е сравнително кратък. При такъв случай, лесно е да се потвърди превъплътяването за този специфичен случай и това е част от обучението на ученик от Старшите Братя. На него му се показва дете на което му предстои да умре и му се казва да наблюдава това дете в невидимия свят за може би една или две години, следвайки го стъпка по стъпка докато приеме ново въплътяване – може би със същите или с други родители. Когато един окултен ученик е следвал един Его в невидимите светове от смъртта му до следващото му раждане, той абсолютно сигурно знае че законът за прераждането е факт в природата и често той има възможност на базата на други свои изследвания да проследи миналите животи на много хора. 

Все пак, обаче, може да се настоява, не би ли могло това ясновидство за което той разказва като за свои изследвания, да бъде халюцинация? Не би ли могло той да бъде жертва на химерни видения, въпреки че е напълно искрен? В отговор на такива предположения, може да се потвърди, че той има всеки ден на свое разположение възможности за потвърждаване на своите наблюдения. Когато един човек е посетил Ню Йорк и е видял града, той никога не би бил изкушен да каже, чудя се дали наистина го видях или е моя заблуда? Той е бил там и го знае. Така е и с ясновидеца. През времето когато е напуснал тялото си той се среща и работи с хора които не познава в обикновения си живот. По-късно, той може би ще бъде поканен да се срещне с тези приятели от невидимите светове; той може да пътува следвайки техните ясновидски указания за посоката към града който не познава; той може да ги намери на тяхната улица в техния дом използвайки ясновидство, да ги познае и да бъде разпознат от тях. След това, той може да си приказва с тези приятели за нещата които са правили и за местата където са били в невидимите си тела и ако изобщо е имал някакви съмнения за реалността на живота си извън плътния физически свят, веднъж за винаги ще бъде убеден в реалността на преживяванията си извън тялото. Той знае и е убеден, че не са небивалици, че той не е бил в състояние на зашеметяване и че неговото пребиваване там, неговата работа там и неговите преживявания там са точно толкова реални, както неговия живот, неговата работа и неговите преживявания тук. 

### <h3 id="question-68">ВЪПРОС No.68</h3>

Дали душите, които са преминали през Чистилището и през Първото, Второто и Третото Небе се връщат тук за реинкарнация на тази земя или отиват на други нива? 

Отговор: Те се връщат отново на тази земя докато научат уроците които могат да бъдат научени тук. По принцип е същото както когато изпращаме едно дете на училище. Не го изпращаме един ден в детската градина, на следващия в училище и на третия в университета, а го изпращаме в предучилищната група ден след ден за дълго време докато усвои всички уроци които могат да бъдат научени там. Знанията които е получило в предучилищната група образуват базата за това което трябва да учи в началното училище; там придобива базата за това което трябва да учи в гимназията и в университета. Подобен е процесът при който сме научили уроците при различни условия на околната среда в миналото, а в бъдеще, когато сме усвоили всичко което може да се научи при сегашните земни условия, пред нас ще ни очакват задачите на по-напреднала еволюция. Прогресът е безкраен, защото ние сме божествени като нашия Отец в небесата и ограниченията са невъзможни. 

### <h3 id="question-69">ВЪПРОС No.69</h3>

Дали се срещаме с приятелите си от някой предишен живот, когато се родим отново за земен живот? 

Отговор: Законът за прераждане действа заедно със закона за причинно- следствената връзка. Очевидно е, че за всички нас има много действия които са генерирали причини, които остават без последствия през настоящия живот. Например, съпругът е болен и съпругата му се грижи за него без да жали себе си. Тук, очевидно има дълг, и ако заболяването продължи до края на живота на съпруга, няма да има възможност дългът да бъде върнат през този живот. Но ако познаваме природните закони и знаем как те действат, ние разбираме че те не преустановяват действието си поради такава незначителна причина като прекратяването на живота в едно тяло. Ако си счупим крака той не може да зарасне още на другия ден, въпреки че сме спали през нощта без да съзнаваме нараняването си; и когато се събудим, кракът е в почти същото състояние както предишния ден. Така е и с делата, извършени в тялото през един живот. Въпреки че преминаваме през живота между смъртта и новото раждане и през това време нямаме съзнание за предишните си животи, когато навлизаме в нов живот, законът за причинно-следствената връзка, причините създадени в предишен живот, ще ни доведат в среда където ще открием старите си приятели или старите си врагове. Ние ги познаваме добре, въпреки че може би не можем да ги разпознаем директно. Понякога, обаче, срещаме за първи път някой човек и биваме привлечени към него; имаме чувството че сме познавали този човек през целия си живот и че можем да му се доверим напълно. Така е, защото духът от вътре вижда един стар приятел и го разпознава, въпреки че не е в състояние да предаде това на мозъка който притежава сега. Или, може би, срещаме човек в чието обкръжение не бихме искали да бъдем; ние инстинктивно не го харесваме, въпреки че от обикновена гледна точка нямаме основание за това; това също е разпознаване от духа, който прехвърля мост към миналото и вижда враг от отдавнашните времена. Затова нашите симпатии и антипатии са нашите водачи от минали преживявания и обикновено се оказва, че можем да им се доверим, когато след последвалите събития обърнем поглед назад.

Дали опитът, придобит през всяка инкарнация, се записва отделно и се прибавя към предишния, така че накрая духът да бъде напълно съзнателен за пълния сбор от опитности или опитът от един живот, повече или по-малко несъзнателно, се абсорбира при последващата инкарнация, така че се придобива обобщения резултат? 

Отговор: Когато сме били деца ние сме се учили да пишем и движенията на ръката ни са били много несръчни преди най-накрая да усвоим това умение. През годините които са преминали от тогава, ние сме забравили преживяванията ни по време на процеса на учене, но способността ни да пишем е винаги на разположение когато е необходима. 

По подобен начин, преживяванията които сме имали през различни животи обикновено са забравени от човек, но способностите които са култивирани остават и са на разположение за използване по всяко време. Понякога срещаме човек който никога не е учил да рисува, но въпреки това е художник създаващ прекрасни картини. Той е пренесъл през миналите животи това качество, което сега е в състояние да използва. Когато научаваме за Моцарт, как е композирал на три годишна възраст, това също демонстрира акумулирането на чувство за хармония в миналото. Следователно, може да се каже, че въпреки че не си спомняме, ние винаги имаме на разположение за ползване през настоящето време качествата които сме култивирали през миналите си животи. Това е което създава разликата между човек и човек, между глупак и мъдрец. 

Има, обаче, също и запис в природата, който съдържа нашите минали животи с точност до минута. Обученият ясновидец, който е способен да чете в миналото на природата, може да проследи миналите животи на един човек в обратен ред, както например, филмова лента се върти назад. Той ще види първо настоящия живот на този човек, неговото раждане, преди това пребиваването му в невидимите светове, след това смъртта от предишния живот, лентата ще се развие обратно през старостта, зрелостта, младостта, детството и бебешката възраст, назад към това раждане, и така нататък през различните животи.

Когато духът, спускайки се за прераждане, е привлякъл към себе си своето вещество (или материя) от Света на Мисълта и слиза в Света на Желанията, не се ли озовава отново в Чистилището? 

Отговор: Трудността за задаващия въпроса се състои в това, че той не е разбрал напълно какво всъщност представлява Чистилището. Чистилището се намира в долните области на Света на Желанията, но тези области не са Чистилище за онези, които няма от какво да се очистват. Низките желания на човек са формирани от веществото (или материята) на желанията от тази област и понеже те не могат да бъдат задоволени, човек страда. Освен това, там силата на отблъскване (или на отхвърляне) е максимална и когато Его преминава нагоре към Небесния Свят, той има в свето тяло на желанията картинни отпечатъци на лошите дела които е извършил. Тези картини, също така, са формирани от грубото вещество на желанията защото те са били създадени от страстите на човека по времето когато е извършил злодеянието което те обрисуват и центробежната сила на отблъскване се стреми да ги отстрани от неговата форма. Процесът на откъсването е това, което причинява болката която той чувства. От друга страна, когато Его преминава през тази област по пътя си към прераждане, центростремителната сила на привличане донася ново вещество на желанията в неговата форма. Тогава това не е Чистилище изобщо, нито е Чистилище за Невидимите Помощници които пребивават сред затворените духовете стремейки се да им помогнат в усвояването на уроците които ще ги направят по-добри хора. Това което прави тази област да се преживява като Чистилище, е че там духът трябва да отстрани злото. 

### <h3 id="question-72">ВЪПРОС No.72</h3>

Как може да вярвате в теорията за реинкарнация, че ние се връщаме тук в тяло на животно? Не е ли много по-красиво да се вярва в Християнската Доктрина, че отиваме на небето при Бог и Ангелите? 

Отговор: Авторът никога не е защитавал възгледите които му се приписват от задаващия въпроса, който, вероятно, въобще не е изучавал темата. Има една доктрина на едни от най-изостаналите племена от Изтока, която съдържа теорията за трансмиграция, че човешкият дух може да се инкарнира в тела на животни, но това е нещо много различно от доктрината за реинкарнация, според която човек е еволюирало същество преминаващ през училището на живота чрез повтарящи се въплътявания в тела с непрекъснато усъвършенстващо се устройство. Христос казва на своите ученици:’’Затова бъдете съвършени, както е съвършен нашият Отец на небесата’’. Това е била задължителна заповед и Христос никога не би я дал, ако беше непостижима; но всички ние знаем че не можем да постигнем това в един кратък живот. При достатъчно време и възможности постигнати чрез повтарящи се въплътявания в променена околна среда, обаче, някога ние ще завършим работата за усъвършенстването си. 

Няма достоверно описание на доктрината за трансмиграцията в нито едно свещено писание на Изтока, единственото подобие на такава идея е намерено в Kathopanishad, глава 5, стих 9, където се казва, че някои от душите, съобразно техните дела, се връщат към утробата за да се преродят, но други отиват в неподвижността. Смята се, според мнението на някои, че те могат да реинкарнират надолу дори в минералното царство. Санскритската дума, която е използвана на това място е sthanu, която също означава стълб, колона, и прочитайки по този начин получаваме същата идея, като от следния пасаж на Библията: ‘’Него ще направя стълб в дома на Господ, и той няма да излиза повече’’. Когато човечеството достигне съвършенство хората повече няма да бъдат привързани към колелото на раждания и смърти, те ще останат в Невидимите Светове за да работят от този момент нататък за повдигането на други същества. 

Освен това, трансмиграцията е невъзможно нещо в природата, защото във всяко човешко тяло има вътреживеещ (или вътре пребиваващ) индивидуален дух, докато всеки животински род е управляван от общ, или групов дух, част от който са всички животни и никой себе-съзнателен Его не може да влезе в тяло управлявано от друг. 

Задаващият въпроса пита дали не е по-красиво да вярваме в небето с Бог и Ангелите? Може би е така, но ние не се интересуваме много от това, какво би направило представите ни красиви, а търсим истината и въпреки че доктрината за реинкарнация понякога е осмивана от дървени философи като невъзможна и езическа, наистина въпросът не е в това дали е езическа или не. Когато се занимаваме с математическа задача не ни интересува кой първо я е решил; всичко което ни интересува е дали е решена правилно. Така е и с тази доктрина, не е важно кой я е формулирал пръв, тя е която ще разреши всички проблеми свързани с учението за живота по разумен и смислен начин, докато теорията че човек който, може би, никога не се е занимавал с музика и не знае елементарни неща за хармонията, веднага след смъртта си развива ненаситна страст към музиката и се наслаждава на звука на тромпет и звънтенето на арфа през вечността, по-скоро е нелепа и смешна. 

<h2 id="section-4">РАЗДЕЛ IV: Въпроси отнасящи се до УЧЕНИЕТО НА БИБЛИЯТА</h2>

### <h3 id="question-73">ВЪПРОС No.73</h3>

Защо се получава така, че всяко вероизповедание интерпретирайки библията по различен начин, намира доказателства за своите собствени идеи в тази книга? 

Отговор: Този въпрос, ако се задава от скептик, му доставя голямо удоволствие защото той вижда в него доказателство за своята идея, че всички секти грешат във вярата си и че Библията е конгломерат от глупости, докато фактически нещата са много по-различни. Ние не се борим за светостта на тази Книга и не твърдим, че тя е Света на Бог от кора до кора; ние признаваме факта, че тя е недобър превод от оригиналите и че в нея има много интерполации (леки отклонения в значението на думи и изрази) които са били вмъкнати по различно време с цел да подкрепят различни идеи, но въпреки всичко, самият факт, че толкова много истина е побрана в такъв малък обем, е източник на безкрайно възхищение от страна на окултиста, който знае какво тази Книга наистина е и той има ключа към смисъла на нейното съдържание. 

Има един факт, който скептикът пропуска да забележи. Неговата идея е, че ако дадена интерпретация е вярна, всички други интерпретации трябва задължително да бъдат грешни. Тази идея е подчертано неправилна. Истината има много лица и е безгранична; търсенето на истината също би трябвало да бъде всеобхватно и безгранично. Можем да оприличим истината на планина, а различните интерпретации на тази истина на различните пътеки водещи нагоре към върха. Много хора вървят по различни пътеки и всеки един от тях си мисли, че неговият път е единственият докато той е в подножието на планината; той вижда само малка част от планината и поради това може да бъде оправдан за това че вика на своите братя: ‘’Вие грешите; елате на моя път; той е единствено верният, който води към върха’’. Но когато всички тези хора напреднат нагоре, те ще видят че пътеките се събират на върха и че накрая те всички са едно. 

Подчертано може да се каже, че нито една система от истини, която изобщо е била в състояние да заинтересува голям брой хора и да задържи вниманието им за значителна продължителност от време, не е била лишена от своя истина; и дали разбираме или не, във всяко вероизповедание има зърно от божествено учение което непрекъснато повдига привържениците му нагоре към върха на планината и поради това трябва да имаме в най-голяма степен толерантност към всяка вяра. 

### <h3 id="question-74">ВЪПРОС No.74</h3>

Какво се има пред вид като Втори Аспект на Триединния Бог? 

Отговор: Бог е един, точно както преминаващата през атмосферата светлина се разлага на три основни цвята – червено, жълто и синьо – така също Бог когато се проявява, или се отразява в природата, е троичен в своето проявление. Има първо Създаващ принцип, след това има Съхраняващ принцип и на трето място има принцип на Разрушаване на формите които са били създадени, били са опазвани през времето когато са били полезни, след това трябва да бъдат разрушени с цел материалът от който са били изградени да може да бъде използван за строежа на нови форми. 

Тези три принципа на Бог са били наричани с различни имена в различните религии и много мастило и много пачи пера са били изразходвани през по-късни времена за защита или заклеймяване на идеята за Троичността, която би трябвало да се открие от всеки който задълбочено я търси в природата. В западния Свят (Християнството) ние сме свикнали да наричаме Втория аспект на Триединния Бог, обединяващия съхраняващ принцип, Христос; и това е много подходящо в този смисъл, защото Христос дойде като учител на Любов и Всеобщо Братство, което трябваше да замести нациите които воюваха една срещу друга, и Самият Той каза, че има дори още по-висока фаза, когато Царството което Той ще създаде ще премине към Отеца и всички ще бъдат едно в Него. 

### <h3 id="question-75">ВЪПРОС No.75</h3>

Записващите Ангели индивидуални Създания ли са? 

Отговор: Да, те са могъщи индивидуалности, представители на Великите Планетарни Ангели и като такива те се грижат за раждането на човек помагайки му в избора на околна среда и определяйки за всеки живот точната съдба която е готова да бъде отработена в последствия. Те ръководят звездните влияния по такъв начин, че да улеснят всеки човек в ликвидирането на минали задлъжнявания към другите, помагайки му, също така, да ожъне наградата за каквито добрини той е сторил през минали животи. 

В тази дейност Записващите Ангели са подпомагани от могъщо множество от действащи сили и от природни духове, които още не са индивидуализирани, но работят под ръководството на тези Велики Същества несъзнателно, много подобно на начина по който животните биват ръководени от груповите духове. 

### <h3 id="question-76">ВЪПРОС No.76</h3>

Дали Ангелите и Архангелите ни наблюдават индивидуално както и колективно, така че да знаят всичко за нашия живот? 

Отговор: Боговете на Ума (mind*), които Павел нарича ‘’Силите на Тъмнината’’ защото те са били човечеството от тъмния Сатурнов Период, когато вселената току що е била излязла от състоянието на хаос, работят само с човек. 

() - mind* - може да се преведе като ум, разум, разсъдък, но имайки пред вид, че умът е основата на разума и разсъдъка, думата е преведена като ум; но може да се преведе и като ’’съзнание’’ и тук е трудността да се разбере какъв точно смисъл е искал да и предаде авторът. 

Архангелите, които са били хора през огнения Слънчев Период, когато вселената се е състояла от ‘’материя на желанията’’ сега работят като помощници на груповите духове на животните и като расови духове на човечеството, защото тези групи от създания имат тяло на желанията. 

Ангелите, които са били човечеството на Лунния Период, работят върху човек, животно и растение, защото през Лунния Период вселената се е състояла от ‘’етер’’ и виталното тяло на трите по-горе споменати царства е изградено от такава материя. Затова, Ангелите помагат на жизнените функции, като усвояването на храната или асимилацията, растежа и размножаването и при работата си с човечеството те са родови духове. Те предизвикват нарастване на броя на членовете на семейството, нарастването на стадата и на добива от нивята. 

Човекът, от своя страна, който е малко по-ниско от Ангелите, работи с минералите, които се намират в химическата област на Физическия Свят, съставени от газове, течности и твърди тела. За минералите той представлява това, което са за нас По-висшите Създания. Той постепенно ги събужда за живот, като ги моделира в къщи, мостове, железопътни линии и т.н. 

През бъдеща инкарнация на земята, когато тези минерали ще са станали подобни на растения, човек ще се е научил да работи с живота и ще бъде за тях същото, което са сега Ангелите за нас. И така, съществува безкрайна прогресия, по- висшите винаги помагат на по-малко еволюиралите, докато всички достигнат съвършенство. 

Отговаряйки на въпроса по-точно, можем да кажем, че Архангелите работят с нациите и расите на земята, докато Ангелите се занимават с родовете и индивидите в семейството. ‘’Ангелът Хранител’’, обаче, не е точно създание от по- напреднал еволюционен стадий, а е по-скоро персонифицирано въплъщение на нашите добри дела през всичките ни минали животи, което въпреки че е невидимо за нас, винаги е с нас подтиквайки ни към правилни действия и към повече добри дела. 

### <h3 id="question-77">ВЪПРОС No.77</h3>

Имат ли Ангелите крила, както са изобразявани на картини? 

Отговор? Не, никой от тях няма такива птичи крила, както са представени на изображенията, но има някои класове от Създания в Духовните Светове, които притежават подобни на крила части. Те, обаче, не служат за летене или придвижване в пространството, а са потоци от сила които могат да бъдат отправени в различни посоки, както ние използваме нашите ръце или крака. По такъв начин, един Архангел, който е тласнал армиите на два народа в битка, може да изпрати поток от духовна сила в дадено направление сковавайки в страх войниците от едната армия и може да изпрати друга сила която да вдъхне смелост в противниковата войска, като по този начин влияе на сражението по неподозиран за участниците начин. 

### <h3 id="question-78">ВЪПРОС No.78</h3> 

Дали Розенкройцерите приемат Библията за ‘’Словото на Бога’’ от кора до кора? 

Отговор: Със сигурност не, и по-точно, в изключително ограничената интерпретация на някои хора които мислят, че книгата която е на наше разположение сега е единствения оригинал даден на човечеството. В най-добрия случай, тя може да е една от книгите на Бога, защото има много други свещени писания които имат претенции да бъдат признати и не може да бъдат пренебрегнати защото немного на брой некомпетентни авторитета смятат, че така наречените апокрифни писания трябва да бъдат изхвърлени на боклука. 

На първо място, трябва да се има пред вид, че Старият Завет е бил написан на староеврейски език през различни периоди от време и от много автори и преди Ездра не е било направено обединяване на тези писания в една книга. От тези писания сега не е останала и следа. Освен това, много отдавна, 280 година преди новата ера, староеврейският език е бил изоставен, що се отнася до ръкописни текстове и е започнал основно да се използва Septuagint, или Гръцкия Превод. Това е била единствената съществуваща Библия по времето когато Христос е бил роден. По-късно, някои от писанията на староеврейски език са били събрани и сравнени детайлно от Масоретите, секта която е съществувала около 700та година от новата ера. Това е най-добрия и най-точния текст. 

Английският превод, който е най-използван сега, е версията на крал Джеймс, но Негово Височество не е бил загрижен толкова за точността на превода, колкото за мира и спокойствието, и актът за превеждане на Библията е забранил на преводачите да превеждат който и да било пасаж по начин който би внесъл смущение в съществуващите вярвания. Това е било направено с цел да бъдат предотвратени размирици или въстание в неговото царство, и от четиридесет и седем преводачи само три са владеели добре староеврейски език и двама от тях са умрели преди да бъде завършен превода на Псалмите. Няколко книги са били игнорирани, като апокрифни, а оригиналното значение на думи е било променено – за да ги нагоди към суеверието на онези времена. Мартин Лутер, в Германия, е превеждал от латинския текст, който от своя страна е бил преведен от гръцки език и затова вероятността да бъдат предаден неправилен смисъл нараства по много различни начини. Към всичко до тук, може да бъде прибавен и факта, че в староеврейски език не са били идентифицирани гласните и думите не са били отделяни една от друга, и по този начин, като се вмъкват прекъсвания или разстояния в текста по различен начин, почти от всяко изречение могат да се получат думи и изречения със съвсем различен смисъл. Взимайки пред вид тези факти, ясно е, че вероятността да имаме точна версия на оригинала е наистина малка. 

Нещо повече, истинските автори не са имали намерения да направят Библията открита ‘’Книга на Бога’’, което ясно се вижда в следния цитат на Зохар: ‘’Тежко му на този, който вижда в Тора (законът – Библията) само прости стихове и обикновени думи, защото ако наистина тя съдържа само такива, ние бихме били в състояние дори днес да съставим Тора по-достойна за възхищение. Но не е така; всяка дума в Тора съдържа възвишен смисъл и сублимна тайна… Стиховете в Тора са одеждите на Тора… Тежко му на този който възприема тези одежди на Тора за самата Тора… Обикновените хора обръщат внимание само на одеждите и стиховете на Тора; те не знаят нищо друго; те не виждат какво е скрито под одеждата; знаещите не обръщат внимание на одеждата, а на това което тя покрива…’’. 

С други думи, те не обръщат внимание на буквалния текст, а се интересуват само от духовния смисъл. Но, както в една нива засята с картофи, има не само растенията картофи а също така и почва, в която те са скрити, така също и в Библията перлите на окултната истина са скрити в одежди. Окултистът който е постигнал способността да открива тези перли е получил ключа и ясно ги вижда. За другите, те остават скрити дотогава докато не положат усилия да придобият ключа. Затова, докато историята за странстванията на децата на Израел и общуването им с някакъв Бог е отчасти истина, има и духовен смисъл който е далеч по-важен отколкото самата история. Освен, че съдържат добре описан в общи линии живота на човек наречен Христос, евангелията са система указания за посвещаване, показваща опита през който всеки трябва да премине в бъдеще по пътя към истината и живота. 

Този път е бил провидян от различни хора, които са писали Библията и които, поради това, са били пророци и ясновидци, но само толкова колкото е било възможно за тяхното време. 

Една нова ера ще изисква нова Библия, ново слово. 

### <h3 id="question-79">ВЪПРОС No.79</h3>

Какво е становището на Розенкройцерите относно създаването на света за седем дни? 

Отговор: В Библията има два разказа за създаването на света. Единият от тях започва в първия стих на началната глава и завършва с третия стих на втората глава от Битие. Другото описание започва в четвъртия стих. 

Тези два разказа за създаването на света изглеждат съвършено различни в няколко отношения. Първото описание твърди, че в началото земята е била покрита с вода; второто твърди, че тя е била суха. В първото се казва, че човек е бил създаден последен; във втората версия се казва, че той е бил първото създание. Тези несъответствия изглеждат непримирими и доставят на скептика огромно удовлетворение когато ги разказва с надменна усмивка на съжаление към горките невежи глупаци които вярват на такива глупави безсмислици. Обаче, двете описания в действителност не са несъвместими, те се допълват и не са в противоречие с научните факти. Първото описание засяга генезиса на формите, второто засяга еволюцията на съзнанието. Човешката форма, в сегашното и състояние, е върха на еволюцията, изградена на базата на всички по-примитивни форми които са изчезнали. Животът, който е човек, мислителят, е без начало и край, вечен както е Самият Бог, и този живот е бил тук преди всички форми, като се казва във втория разказ за сътворението. 

Относно времето, за което е казано, че това създаване на форми е било извършено, Розенкройцерите не твърдят, че то е било осъществено за седем дни от по двадесет и четири часа, а че в нашия план на проявяване са необходими седем велики трансформации на земята, които улесняват пълната еволюция на себе-съзнанието и душевната сила на еволюиращите духове. Три и половина от тези периоди са били използвани за придобиване на тела-носители; останалите ще са необходими за еволюцията на съзнанието. 

Началният стих на Библията излага твърдението, че в началото земята е била тъмна и без определена форма. Това е било Сатурновия Период, когато е започнала да се формира огнената мъгла на коренната субстанция на вселената. 

В третия стих ни се дава информацията, че Бог е казал: ‘’Да бъде светлина’’, пасаж, на който са се подигравали като демонстриращ невежеството на авторите и на несъвместимостта на така описаното с научните факти; защото, казва ученият: ‘’След като Слънцето и Луната не са били създадени преди четвъртия ден, как е възможно да има светлина преди това?’’. Не става въпрос за света, такъв какъвто е сега, твърда маса. Той сега, разбира се, че ще бъде тъмен без външен източник на светлина, през онези времена светът е бил в процес на създаване и съответно на небуларната теория, първо е трябвало да съществува етап на тъмна топлина, на който ние сме дали името Сатурнов Период. По-късно мъглата се е възпламенила и е започнала да свети; светлината е от вътре и не зависи от външни източници, от Слънцето и Луната. Вторият етап от развитието на нашата планета се нарича Слънчев Период. 

След това четем, че Бог е казал: ‘’Нека водите да се разширят за да се раздели вода от вода’’( от Библията на крал Джеймс). Употребената тук дума ‘’разширение’’ е преведена като ‘’небесния свод’’ в официалната версия, но ние използваме текста на Масоретите, който е преведен от способни преводачи, които не са били длъжни да спазват ограниченията наложени от царския декрет, който е спъвал преводачите на крал Джеймс. Използването на израза ‘’разширение’’ прави Библията непротиворечаща на небуларната теория, защото когато в космическото пространство се появи материя в състояние на огнена мъгла, се образува влага при контакта на външната част на огнената маса със заобикалящото я пространство, което е студено. Тази влага се нагрява и се разширява в пара, която се изтласква навън от огнения център, там тя се охлажда, кондензира се и гравитира обратно към източника на топлина. Така, че разширението на водите разделя вода от вода, плътната влага остава близо до огненото ядро, а парата отвън. Този етап от втвърдяването на земята се нарича Лунен Период. 

Продължаващото нагряване до кипене на водата обграждаща огненото ядро, накрая предизвикало изкристализиране и се появила твърда земя. Четем, че ‘’Бог е нарекъл сухата твърд Земя’’. 

През първата част на настоящия период земята е била толкова тъмна както през Сатурновия Период. Тогава са съществували само минерални субстанции (химическите елементи от таблицата на Менделеев). Този етап се нарича Поларианска Епоха. 

Огненият Слънчев Период намира своето съответствие в Хиперборианската Епоха, която е описана в стиховете 11 – 19 като време през което са били създадени растения, а земята е станала планета осветявана от вън от слънцето и луната. Така завършва описанието на работата, която е била извършена през четвъртия велик ден на развитието на нашата земя. 

През Лемурианската Епоха условията са същите като през Лунния Период, огнено ядро и атмосфера от огнена мъгла, също така генезис на по-нисшите класове животни, описана в Библейския разказ като работата на петия ден. През Атлантската Епоха са били създадени гръбначните бозайници и човека, както е описано в началото на шестия ден, и когато човек е станал мислещо същество през Арианската Епоха, Боговете си починали, оставяйки го да работи сам върху спасението си под господството на двойката закони за Прераждането и Причинно-следствената връзка. 

### <h3 id="question-80">ВЪПРОС No.80</h3>

Библията учи, че душата е безсмъртна по един авторитарен начин. Философията на Розенкройцерите учи същото, претендирайки че се позовава на разума. Няма ли категорични доказателства за безсмъртието? 

Отговор: Задаващият въпроса греши като казва, че Библията проповядва безсмъртието на душата. Никъде не се споменава думата безсмъртие или небесен живот, в смисъл на притежание на човека, в Стария Завет. Изрично се твърди, че ‘’Небесата са на Господ, но той е дал земята на човеците’’: псалм 115, 16ти стих. Изрично е споменато, че ‘’душата която извършва грях ще умре’’. Ако душата беше безсмъртна, това би било невъзможно. В Новия Завет думата ‘’безсмъртен’’ или ‘’безсмъртие’’ е използвана само шест пъти. Смисълът и’ е като на нещо желано или като атрибут на Бога. 

Що се отнася до духа, обаче, нещата са различни и въпреки това, където се говори за него думата безсмъртен не се използва. За безсмъртието е загатнато по същия начин както за доктрината за прераждането в много пасажи, но доктрината за прераждането има предимство пред доктрината за безсмъртието на човешкия дух, защото доктрината за прераждането е спомената определено поне веднъж в Матей 11 : 14, където Христос казва за Йоан Кръстител: ‘’Това е Илия’’. В това учение доктрината за безсмъртие също е загатната, защото ако духът на Илия е бил прероден като Йоан Кръстител, той би трябвало да е победил смъртта на тялото. Учението за безсмъртието през онези времена е било тайно учение, а дори и в днешно време то трудно може да се възприеме преди човек да е встъпил в пътя на посвещаването и там да е видял безкрайността на живота. 

Би могло да се твърди, обаче, като отговор на въпроса, че всичко се върти около това какво означава ‘’категорично доказателство’’, и каква е компетентността на човека, който търси доказателство. Не може да бъде доказана една тригонометрична задача на малко дете, но ако му се даде време да порасне и да получи необходимите знания, ще бъде лесно да се докаже задачата. Нито пък можем да докажем съществуването на цветовете и светлината на човек който е бил роден сляп; това са факти (истини) които той не може да възприеме поради липса на необходимите способности. Но ако той придобие способността да вижда чрез подходяща операция, ще бъде излишно да доказваме пред него тези факти, той сам ще види тяхната истинност. По същите причини, никой не би оценил доказателствата за безсмъртието на духа, докато не е станал способен да вижда духа; тогава за него ще бъде лесно да получи истинско доказателство за безсмъртието на духа, неговото съществуване преди раждането и оставането му след смъртта. Преди да е придобил тази способност, човек трябва да се задоволи с приемливи смислени логически заключения, които могат да се получат по много начини. 

### <h3 id="question-81">ВЪПРОС No.81</h3>

Дали има някаква достоверна информация в Библията за теорията за прераждането? 

Отговор: Да, има много достоверна информация, въпреки че е изложена явно само на едно място. Ако еврейските свещеници не са вярвали в теорията за прераждането, те не биха изпратили да попитат Йоан Кръстител: ‘’Не си ли ти Илия?’’, както е записано в първа глава на Йоан в 21 стих; и в Евангелието на Матей намираме думите на Христос относно Йоан Кръстител които са недвусмислени. Той казва: ‘’Това е Илия’’. Също така, по-нататък когато те са при Планината на Преображението, Христос казва: ‘’Илия е дошъл и те са му направили каквото сме чули’’, по-нататък се казва, че учениците му ‘’знаеха, че той говори за Йоан’’, който след това е бил обезглавен от Ирод. 

В Евангелието на Матей, 16та глава 13ти стих Той пита своите ученици ‘’за кого Ме човеците мислят, Мене, Сина Човечески?’’ и отговорът който Му дават е: ‘’едни – за Йоана Кръстителя, други – за Илия, а някои за Йеремия или за едного от пророците’’. Забележително е, че Христос съвсем не им противоречи, защото той е бил учителя и ако те са се позовавали на една грешна идея – доктрината за прераждане, би трябвало да бъде негово задължение да ги поправи. Но той не е направил това. Нещо повече, според горния пасаж, той точно така е мислил. 

В Библията, също така, са споменати случаи, когато определен човек е бил избран да направи нещо преди раждането си. Един Ангел е предрекъл идването на Самсон и неговата мисия да убие филистинците. Господ е казал на пророка Йеремия: ‘’Преди още да излезеш от утробата, аз те осветих и ръкоположих за пророк на народите’’. Йоан и Христос са имали предназначените си мисии още преди да са били родени. Един човек се избира за определена мисия поради специфичните му способности. Съвършенството предполага усилия и практика, а практика преди раждането би трябвало да е била осъществена в предишен живот. Следователно, доктрината за прераждане се излага косвено, по заобиколен път, в тези цитирани примери. 

### <h3 id="question-82">ВЪПРОС No.82</h3>

Според Библията, само на човек е дадена душа. Защо, тогава, казвате, че животните имат групов дух? 

Отговор: В първата глава на Битие, стих 20, четем че Бог казал: ‘’И рече Бог: да произведе водата изобилие от движещи се създания които имат живот’’*. Думата използвана от Староеврейски език е nephesh, което означава ‘’дихание’’. Тази дума също така е използвана във втората глава, стих 7, където се казва: ‘’И създаде Господ Бог човека от земна пръст и вдъхна в лицето му дихание за живот (nephesh); и стана човекът ‘’nephesh chayim‘’, дишащо създание. Не жива душа, както е преведено (в английската версия**). Преводът на крал Джеймс е бил модифициран от хора, които не са имали грижа за истината, а за предубедени идеи. Те са се съгласили да използват думата ‘’душа’’ в полето като вариантна на думата в глава 1, стих 20, където е описано създаването на животните, така че дори в днешните Библии е прието че животните имат душа. 

() - * В българската Библия, която е превод от гръцката, пише ‘’жива душа’’, за животните

() - ** Текстът в българската Библия е: ‘’И рече Бог: да произведе водата влечуги, живи души; и птици да полетят над земята по небесната твърд. (Така и стана.)   

Обаче, този превод не е верен; nephesh означава дихание, а не душа; староеврейската дума за душа е neshamah. Душа не е синоним на дух, който на староеврейски е Ruach, така че в Битие не се споменава духът нито на човек, нито на животно, защото духът не се създава, той е. Формите на животното и човека, които са съставени от дихание имат начало и това е, което Генезис (Битие) описва. Тази идея се съгласува перфектно с думите на Соломон в Еклисиаста 3:19, където се казва (доколкото се отнася до тялото направено от кал) човек няма превъзходство над животното защото както умира единият, така умира и другият; те всички имат един дъх (nephesh) и като умира единият, така умира и другият. Всички отиват на едно място (а именно, Светът на Желанията). 

Ако задаващият въпроса приема само английската дума и версия на Библията, все едно че тази книга е била написана директно на нашия език, би било справедливо да се попита: ако мъжът е получил душата си, както е описано в Библията, от къде е получила своята душа жената; или тя е без душа? 

### <h3 id="question-83">ВЪПРОС No.83</h3>

Вярно ли е, че Ева е направена от Адамова част? 

Отговор: Измежду четиридесет и седемте преводачи на Библията на крал Джеймс, само трима са владеели староеврейски език и двама от тях са умрели преди да бъдат преведени Псалмите. Освен това, на староеврейски език, в частност при стария стил на писане, никога не е била определена позицията на гласните и поради това на дадена дума могат да бъдат дадени различни значения в зависимост от начина на вмъкване на тези позиции. Конкретна за историята за реброто на Адам, думата е преведена като ‘’ребро’’ по един начин се чете tsad, което наистина означава ребро, но по друг начин се чете tsela, което означава страна. Окултното учение твърди, относно създаването на земята и човека, че е имало времена когато човек е бил като Бог или Елохим които са го създали, еднополов.Той е бил едновременно мъж и жена, хермафродит, способен да създава друго същество от себе си. По късно е станало необходимо за неговата бъдеща еволюция, да бъде създаден мозък, и докато преди това той е излъчвал от себе си двойната създаваща сила, активна и пасивна (или положителна и отрицателна), половината от нея е била задържана за изграждането на мозък, ларинкс и нервна система, като органи на мисленето и инструмент за управление с помощта на който духът може да манипулира своя организъм и да се изразява посредством глас. Някои от духовете са задържали активната (положителната) създаваща сила и са отделили пасивната, женската сила, докато други са задържали женската или пасивната (отрицателната) сила и са отделили активната мъжката. Така че, може да се каже, че Бог им е отнел една страна от тяхното същество, но не реброто. Това значение на думата има същото право да бъде признато за вярно, както и преведеното ребро и също така има предимството да обясни необяснимия по другия начин факт. 

### <h3 id="question-84">ВЪПРОС No.84</h3>

Ако Бог е създал човек по свой образ и подобие, предполага се перфектен, защо са били необходими различните епохи преди Падението на Адам и Ева? 

Отговор: Задаващият въпроса е под влиянието на неправилно разбрани факти. В Библията се казва, че Бог е видял своето творение и че то е било ‘’добро’’, но не съвършено. Ако е било перфектно, не би трябвало да бъде необходимо да се прави нищо повече и еволюцията би била излишна. Човешкият род не е станал наистина човешки до късната част на Лемурианската Епоха, когато духът е започнал да влиза в телата. Човечеството на това време, Адам и Ева, се различавало много от сегашното човечество. То също е резултат от еволюционен процес, защото не съществува мигновено сътворяване. Онези същества са прогресирали през етапи на растение-подобни и животно-подобни състояния на развитие от минералното царство, от където са започнали, и не е било само една двойка хора, както обикновено се разбира от ортодоксалната религия, а човечество което е било мъж и жена в един индивид по описаното в Библията време. Казано е, мъж и жена Той ги създаде; и нещо повече, не е било тогава за първи път когато хората са били на земята, или когато земята е била населена с хора, както може да се разбере от Битие 1:28, където на тях им се заповядва да отидат и отново да се намножат на земята, показвайки че земята е била жилище на други създания преди пришествието на тези които се наричат Адам и Ева. Josephus казва, че Адам означава ‘’червена земя’’ и на староеврейски ‘’Admah‘’, думата от която произлиза Адам, означава ‘’твърда земя’’; това обяснява нещата много добре. Adm (както фигурира в текста на староеврейски), не е дошъл на земята преди тя да се втвърди, но е дошъл преди земята да се охлади достатъчно, както е сега, така че земята през онова време наистина е била червена в огнено състояние. Той е бил тук и преди. През по-ранните епохи, преди Лемурианската, духовете са се реели над огнената земя и са помагали да бъде изградена и оформена както е сега. Човешките духове, през онова време, са учили такива уроци за каквито сега ние нямаме понятие. Ние сме били в безсъзнание през онова време, но сме работили също така добре както например нашите храносмилателни органи извършват необходимите за смилане и усвояване на храната био-химични процеси, въпреки че ние не взимаме пряко участие с нашето съзнание в тях. Трябва да е ясно, обаче, че както усилията на децата в детската градина и началното училище са най-важната основа за по- късното обучение в гимназията и университета, така по-ранните епохи са били камъните в основата на нашето сегашно съществуване. Те са толкова необходими, колкото е необходимо научаването на азбуката преди опитите за четене. 

### <h3 id="question-85">ВЪПРОС No.85</h3>

Какъв е бил греха или падението в Рая? 

Отговор: Когато за първи път земята е излязла от състоянието на хаос, тя е била в тъмния и червен етап известен като Поларианската Епоха. Човечеството в началото е излъчило и развило плътно тяло, съвсем различно от нашия сегашен носител, разбира се. Когато състоянието на земята е станало огнено, както през Хипербореанската Епоха, виталното тяло е било добавено и човек е станал подобен на растение, ако може така да се каже, той е имал същите тела-носители каквито нашите растения имат сега и същото подобно на тяхното съзнание, каквото ние имаме по време на сън без сънища когато плътното и виталното тела са изоставени в леглото. 

По онова време, през Хипербореанската Епоха, тялото на човек е било като един огромен балон от газ, реещ се извън огнената земя, той е изхвърлял подобни на растение спори, които след това са израствали и са били използвани от други идващи същества. Тогава човекът е бил двуполов, хермафродит. 

През Лемурианската Епоха, когато земята до известна степен се е охладила и са започнали да се образуват острови от кора всред кипящи морета, тогава и човешкото тяло започнало постепенно да се втвърдява и да заприличва повече на тялото което виждаме сега. То е било подобно на тялото на човекоподобните маймуни, къс торс с огромни ръце и крака, петите са се издавали назад и почти никаква глава – поне горната част на главата изцяло е липсвала. Човек е живеел в атмосфера на пара, която окултистите наричат огнена-мъгла и не е имал бели дробове, но е дишал през нещо като тръбички. Имал е подобен на мехур орган вътре в тялото, който е изпълвал с нагрят въздух за да може да прескача огромни пропасти когато изригвания на вулкани са разрушавали земята на която той е живеел. На задната част на главата му се е издавал един орган който сега е изтеглен вътре в главата и е наречен от медиците пинеална жлеза, или трето око, въпреки че никога не е бил око, а локализиран орган на усещане. Тогава тялото не е притежавало чувство за усет, но когато човек се е доближавал твърде близо до катер на вулкан, горещината е била регистрирана от този орган за да го предупреди да се отдръпне преди тялото му да бъде унищожено. 

През това време, тялото вече до такава степен се е било втвърдило, че за човек е било невъзможно да продължава да се размножава чрез спори и е станало необходимо той да развие орган за мислене, мозък. Творческата сила, която сега използваме за да строим железници, кораби и др. във външния свят, тогава е била използвана вътрешно за строеж на органи. Както всички сили тя е била положителна и отрицателна (или активна и пасивна). Единият полюс е бил изпратен нагоре за да образува мозъка, оставяйки другия полюс на разположение за създаването на друго тяло. И така човек не е бил вече цялостен създаващ субект. Всеки един е притежавал само половината от творческата сила за създаване на потомство и затова за него е станало необходимо да търси своя допълващ субект във външния свят. 

Но тогава: ’’техните очи не са били отворени’’, и човешките същества от онова време са били несъзнателни един за друг във Физическия Свят, но с добро чувство и съзнание в Духовния Свят. Затова, под ръководството на Ангелите, които са им помагали особено що се отнася до размножаването, те са били събирани заедно в големи храмове в определени периоди на годината когато силовите линии протичащи между планетите са били благоприятни и където се осъществявал акта на създаване като религиозна жертва. И когато този древен мъж Адам е извършвал сексуален контакт с жената, духът за момент прониквал през плътта и ‘’Адам познал (или усетил) своята жена’’, той я е усещал физически. Това е което Библията излага, използвайки този целомъдрен израз във всичките свои издания, ние четем че ‘’Elkanah познал своята жена Hannah, и тя роди Samuel‘’. Дори в Новия Завет когато Ангелът идва при Мария казвайки и, че тя е на път да стане майка на Спасителя, тя отговаря: ‘’Как ще бъде възможно това, аз не съм познала мъж?’’. 

Грехът е действие противоречащо на закона и докато човечеството се размножавало под ръководството на Ангелите, които са познавали космическите силови линии, освобождаването от бременност е било безболезнено, както е сега при дивите животни които се размножават само в подходящи периоди от годината ръководени от груповия дух. Но когато човек, действайки съобразно съветите на определени духове, които са били в еволюцията си между хората и Ангелите, започнал да създава по всяко време през годината и винаги, несъобразявайки се с космическите силови линии, този грях ‘’яденето от дървото на познанието’’ е причинил болезненото раждане, както Ангелът е казал на Ева, той не я е проклел, а просто е казал какъв ще бъде резултата от невежото и безразборно използване на създаващата потомство функция. 

### <h3 id="question-86">ВЪПРОС No.86</h3>

Дали Дървото на Живота, за което пише в Библията, е същото като философския камък на алхимиците? 

Отговор: И да и не. За да се разбере за какво става въпрос, трябва да се върнем назад в историята на човечеството. Имало е времена, когато човек е бил двуполов и е притежавал способността да сътворява тяло без помощта на друг човек. Но когато се наложило да бъде изграден мозъка за да може човек да създава чрез мисъл и във физическия свят, едната половина от сексуалната сила е била задържана за изграждане на орган на мисленето. След това е възникнала необходимостта всеки да търси сътрудничество с друг човек, който притежава противоположния полюс на създаващата сила, противоположен полюс на силата която той има на разположение за полова функция. Още не притежавайки мозък и защото ‘’техните очи не са били отворени’’, те разбира се, са били без съзнание във физическия свят и не са били в състояние да управляват живота си сами. Затова Ангелите са ги събирали на едно място в определени периоди от годината когато планетните силови влияния са били благоприятни за да се извърши репродуктивния акт като религиозна жертва, при което те са давали част от своите тела за създаването на тяло-носител на друг дух. При този близък контакт, духът за първи път е прониквал навън през булото на плътта и Адам познавал своята жена. По-късно, когато съзнанието на човек се е фокусирало малко повече върху Физическия Свят, малко на брой измежду хората са започнали смътно да възприемат телата, за които ние сега сме в пълно съзнание; тези най-напреднали индивиди са започнали да проповядват истината за тялото, казвайки на другите че те притежават едно физическо тяло, защото мнозинството от хората тогава са били безсъзнателни за този инструмент, както ние сега сме без съзнание че имаме стомах, когато той е в добро състояние. 

След това е станало ясно, че тези тела умират и е възникнал въпросът измежду най-напредналите индивиди, как едно такова тяло може да бъде заменено. Решението е било дадено на човек от определена група духове, които са били изоставащи от еволюцията на Ангелите, полубогове както би могло да се нарекат. Тези Луциферови Духове, или просветители (даващи светлина), просветили зараждащото се човечество за неговата способност да създава тяло по всяко време. Но тези тела не били съвършени тогава – те не са перфектни и сега - и разбира се, създаването на тела без да се взима под внимание състоянието на планетните сили е имало за резултат дори по-лоши тела, отколкото биха могли да бъдат създадени, плюс болезненото раждане пророкувано от Ангела. 

От тогава създаващата репродуктивна функция е била прилагана неограничено от невежия човешки род. Но, поради това, че съществува смъртта, за Ангелите е било възможно да обучават хората между смъртта и новото раждане как постепенно да правят по-добри тела. Ако човек е бил научил, през това далечно минало, как да подновява своето витално тяло, както е бил научен да създава плътен носител за свое собствено удоволствие, тогава смъртта наистина би била невъзможна и човек би станал безсмъртен като Бог. Но тогава той би обезсмъртил своето несъвършенство и би направил прогреса невъзможен. Подновяването на виталното тяло, това се има пред вид в Библията когато се казва ‘’ядене от Дървото на Живота’’. По времето когато човек е просветен за своето възпроизвеждане, той е бил духовно същество чиито очи още не са били заслепени от материалния свят и ако е бил научил тайната за витализиране на своето тяло по желание, това би унищожило еволюцията. Така че, вижда се че смъртта, ако идва по естествен път, не е проклятие, а нашия най-добър приятел, защото ни освобождава от един инструмент чрез който повече не можем да учим. Тя ни извежда от една околна среда която сме надраснали, така че да можем да се учим да строим по-добро тяло в по-съвършена среда в която можем да осъществим по-голям напредък към целта, която е съвършенство.

По този път най-накрая ще дойде времето когато човек ще бъде способен да притежава силите на живота. Тялото, което е направил за себе си, ще стане чисто и ще му служи за много по-дълъг период от време, отколкото преди. Тогава той ще започне да се стреми към философския камък, elixir vitae, или което и да е название реши да използва. Алхимиците са се стараели да направят този чист свят носител, но не посредством химически процес в лаборатория, както повечето хора незапознати с тази материя, предполагат. Тази идея е трябвало да бъде завоалирана защото те са живели в епоха когато господстващата и назадничава църква би ги осъдила на смърт, ако истината е била известна. Когато са говорили за превръщане на основните метали в злато, те са изказвали истина не само от материална гледна точка, но и от духовна, защото златото винаги е било символ на духа и тези алхимици са се стремили да одухотворят своите тела, които са съставени от материя, базов материал. 

Навсякъде, чистият и красив символ на прозрачността е даден за силата на чистотата.В Стария Завет четем за Храма на Соломон, който е бил построен без ‘’звук на чук’’. Най-красивото място там е било изляното море. Хирам Авий, майсторът-строител, като свое крайно постижение е успял да разтопи металите които са разпространени на земята, в една сплав прозрачна като стъкло. В Новия Завет накрая четем за един красив град в центъра на който има море от стъкло. В страните на изтока, посветеният се стреми да стане диамантена душа, чиста и прозрачна. На Запад Философския камък е символ на пречистена душа извлечена от телата които са били трансмутирни и одухотворени (спиритуализирани, превърнати в душа). Душата която влиза в грях, ще умре, но чистата душа е обезсмъртена чрез elixir vitae, ‘’Дървото на Живота’’, във витално тяло, което ще остане за хилядолетия като тяло-носител на духа.

Господ се е отнесъл с уважение към Авел и неговото кърваво приношение, но към Каин и неговия чист и сладък дар, Той се е отнесъл с неуважение. Защо? 

Отговор: Задаващият въпроса не е разбрал правилно същността. Това което Авел е предложил не е било кърваво приношение. Никъде не се твърди, че Авел е убил дори едно животно. Легендата на окултистите - свободните масони, част от която ще изложим, разказва историята: 

Едно време много отдавна, Елохим създал Ева, той се съединил с нея и тя родила Каин; той я изоставил преди раждането на Каин и затова Каин бил ‘’син на вдовица’’. След това Елохим Йехова създал Адам, който се съединил с Ева и тя родила Авел. След време Каин и Авел направили своите приношения на Йехова, Авел донесъл от своите стада създадени от Бог, докато Каин донесъл това което е бил изработил със собствените си ръце, зърно. И така, Йехова приел дар който Авел е взел готов създаден от природата, но презрял жертвоприношението което било резултат от творческата способност на Каин. Каин убил Авел и бил прокълнат. Адам отново се съединил с Ева и тя родила Сет. 

От Каин и Сет са произлезли два класа от хора. Потомците на Каин са били Тубал-Каин и Хирам Авий, сръчни майстори строители, които са умеели да създават нещата със собствените си ръце, притежавайки вътре в себе си божествената способност да творят, способност да направят така, че да пораснат два стръка трева там където преди е растял само един стрък, и от тях произлизат всички хора които работят с ръцете си и се стремят да завоюват земята и нейните ресурси. 

От Сет са произлезли царете и свещениците, които са получили своята мъдрост наготово от Боговете и са боравели с нещата такива каквито са. Един от тях е бил Соломон, най-мъдрия сред хората, но самият той не е работил за придобиването на тази мъдрост, той я е получил като дар от Бога. Тези два класа и сега могат да бъдат открити на земята и се борят за превъзходство. Единият от тях, е прогресивната светска власт, другият е консервативната църковна власт. 

Затова, причината поради която Йехова е приел приношението на Авел е защото Авел е използвал съществуващи неща, намерени и взети; той е бил син на човек и не се е стремял към божественото творчество. Но Каин е имал божествена природа, той е имал вътре в себе си творчески инстинкт; това не се е харесало на Бог.

Какво е езотерическото значение на Ковчега на Завета? 

Отговор: В най-началните глави на Библията, може да прочетем за Падението в Рая, когато човек взел в свои ръце създаващата репродуктивна сила, използвал я е невежо и по такъв начин е прегрешил пред законите на природата. Размножаването е способност на виталното тяло което е отражение на духа на живота, вторият аспект от тройния дух в човек. 

Херувимите са описани като поставени на стража с огнен меч, когато човек е бил изгонен от Рая, за да не би той да яде от Дървото на Живота и да стане безсмъртен, защото те са били великата творческа йерархия която е властвала на земята през Слънчевия Период когато се е породило виталното тяло и духа на живота е бил събуден за осъзнаване. 

След това е започнало дългото странстване през пустинята на материята и ковчегът на завета е бил символ на човека през неговата миграционна фаза на съществуване. По време на странстването през пустинята, шините които са били използвани за да се носи сандъка, винаги са били оставяни на мястото им за да се покаже, че той не е намерил трайно място за да бъде оставен, но когато е достигнал до Храма на Соломон, неговото странстване приключило и шините са били махнати. 

Като символ на човека, ковчегът е съдържал Книгата на Закона, дадена на човек да го научи да действа правилно. Там е бил Жезълът на Арон, напъпило дърво, жезъл на силата, символизиращ духовната мощ латентна у всеки човек. Този жезъл наподобява копието на Парсифал, което е било инструмент на унищожение в ръцете на Клингсор, Черният Магьосник, също така и в ръцете на Римския войник, но чистият духовен Парсифал го е използвал да излекува раните на Амфортас. Жезълът на Арон е бил използван от Египтяните за предизвикване на нещастия и мъка и след това е бил скрит вътре в ковчега, символ на факта че човек от преди притежава духовната сила с която някога е злоупотребявал и която сега е скрита вътре. 

Там е имало гърне с мана. Това не било храна за тялото, както се обяснява по материалистически начин. Думата мана е почти всеобща. В санскитски език се среща ‘’ manas’’, мислителят. В немски, английски, в скандинавските езици и в много други, се среща същата дума ‘’man‘’ за да изрази мислителя. Поставянето на съда с манната вътре в арка, възспоменава времето когато Его е влязъл във формата която е създал и е станал един вътреживеещ индивидуален дух. 

‘’Падението’’ в условията на плътна материя, е това което прави необходимо размножаването или регенерирането на плътни тела. Когато човек си е присвоил силата за създаването на ново тяло по всяко време, той е бил изгонен от Етерната Област за да не би да си присвои и тайната за витализиране на несъвършените тела които създава и да направи еволюцията невъзможна. 

В първата част на нашия отговор се твърди, че Херувимите са създатели на нашите витални сили, така че те трябва да ги пазят докато човек се научи самият той да има контрол над тях. Затова се казва, че те са били поставени в градината на Еден с Огнен Меч и от най-голяма важност е фактът, че пред вратите на Храма на Соломон са стояли Херувимите държащи в своите ръце вече не Огнен Меч, а разцъфнало цвете. Цветът е размножителния орган на растението, което извършва акта на размножаване по един чист и непорочен начин и когато човек се научи как да стане чист и непорочен, така че всяка форма да се зачева непорочно, той може да влезе в Храма на Бог както ковчегът на завета е влязъл в Храма на Соломон, и той ще може да остане там, както отстраняването на шините символизира, и както пророчески е написано в Откровението където духът казва:’’Този който е победил, аз ще направя стълб в дома на Бога; защото той никога вече няма да си отиде’’. 

### <h3 id="question-89">ВЪПРОС No.89</h3>

Дали има някакво окултно значение в различните Християнски празници през годината? 

Отговор: Да, годишните празници имат най-дълбок окултен смисъл. От материалистическа гледна точка, планетите се възприемат като големи масивни тела които движейки се по своите орбити се подчиняват на така наречените слепи закони, но за един окултист те се явяват като Велики Духовни Същности, движещи се в космическото пространство както ние се движим по света. 

Когато наблюдаваме как някой човек жестикулира, ние придаваме определено значение на жестовете му. Ако той си завърта главата на дясно и на ляво, на нас ни е ясно че той отказва дадено предложение, но ако той кима, ние подразбираме че той е съгласен. Ако той маха с ръце, като дланите му са обърнати към него, знаем че той дава знак някому да дойде при него, но ако той си обърне дланите навън, разбираме че той предупреждава някого да стои далече. Когато става въпрос за космическото пространство, обикновено не смятаме че има някакъв смисъл в различните позиции на планетите, но за окултиста различните феномени в небесата имат най-дълбок смисъл. Те са подобни на човешките жестове. 

Кrisna означава помазвам и в древните времена всеки който е имал специална мисия е бил помазван. Когато през зимата слънцето е под екватора в надира на своето движение, духовните импулси в света са най-силни. За нашето материално благополучие, обаче, Слънцето трябва отново да се придвижи в северната хемисфера, и така, ние наричаме времето когато Слънцето започва своето пътуване към север Рождество Христово (Коледа), рожденият ден на Спасителя помазан да спаси нас от глад и студ, което щеше да се случи ако то би останало в точката на надира завинаги. 

Когато Слънцето се движи към екватора, то преминава през знака Водолей, човекът с вода, по това време земята се напоява от дъждове, което символизира покръстването на Спасителя. Следва преминаването на Слънцето през знака Риби, рибите, през месец март. Запасите от миналата година са изконсумирани и храната на хората е оскъдна, и така настъпват дългите пости на Lent през които яденето на риба символизира тази позиция от слънчевото движение. След това настъпва Passover, когато Слънцето е пресякло екватора. Това е времето на Великден, когато Слънцето е в своята източна* позиция и пресичането на екватора се символизира с разпъването на кръста** на Спасителя; след това Слънцето навлиза в знака Овен, овенът, и става Агнеца Божи, който е даден за спасението на света по времето когато растенията започват да поникват. За да се отрази жертвата благотворно на хората, обаче, той (Слънцето) трябва да се издигне в небесата където неговите лъчи ще имат силата да накарат гроздето и зърното да узреят, и така,имаме празника на Възкачването на Спасителя до трона на Отеца, който е в деня на лятното слънцестоене през юни. Там Слънцето остава за три дена, когато изразът ‘’Тогава той ще се върне’’ влиза в сила, Слънцето започва своето движение на запад. По времето когато то навлиза в знака Дева, девицата, имаме празника Assumption и по-късно когато то напуска знака Дева, рождението на девицата, която изглежда сякаш да е била родена от Слънцето. 

() - източна* - на английски език Велик Ден е Easter, а изток - east, авторът обръща внимание на еднаквия корен на тези две думи.   

() - разпъването на кръста** - подобно, на английски думата пресичане е crossing, а разпъване на кръста е crossification или crucifixion.   

Еврейският празник на Храмовете*** е ставал по времето когато Слънцето е пресичало екватора по пътя си към зимните месеци и заедно с този празник е ставало претеглянето на зърното и прибирането на гроздето, които са били даровете от слънчевия Бог на богославещите го хора. 

() - *** - The Jewish feast of Tabernacles.   

Следователно, всички годишни празници са свързани с движението на звездите през космическото пространство 

### <h3 id="question-90">ВЪПРОС No.90</h3>

Аз разбрах, че вие казвате че Христос е бил въплътен само един път в Исус; не е ли бил преди това въплътен в Гаутама Буда и още по-рано в Кришна?

Отговор: Не. Исус е бил дух принадлежащ към нашата човешка еволюция, такъв е бил и Гуатама Буда. Авторът няма информация относно Кришна, но е склонен да вярва, че той също е бил дух принадлежащ към човешкия род, защото индийските истории за него описват как той е отишъл на небето и какво се е случило там. Христовият дух, който е влязъл в тялото на Исус след като самият Исус го е освободил, е бил лъч от космическия Христос. Ние може да проследим Исус назад през неговите предишни инкарнации и може да го следваме до днешния ден. Христовия дух, точно обратното, изобщо не може да бъде открит измежду човешките духове. 

Може да се каже, че преди идването на Христос, той е работил върху земята отвън, много подобно на това както груповият дух работи с животните отвън, ръководейки ги и помагайки им докато те станат достатъчно индивидуализирани за да могат да бъдат дом за обитаване от индивидуален дух. Преди идването на Христос, не е имало вътреживеещ (или обитаващ) дух в земята, но по времето когато жертвата на голгота е била дадена и Христовият дух е бил освободен от тялото на Исус, той е влязъл в земята и сега е вътреживеещ Земен Дух, за който Павел казва: ‘’стене затворен чакайки деня на освобождението’’, защото противно на общоприетото схващане жертвата на голгота не е приключила със смъртта на тялото на Исус; всъщност, би могло да се каже, че това е било само началото; жертването ще продължи до тогава, докато ние развием алтруизъм и любов, които ще освободят Земния Дух от сковаващите условия на материалното съществуване, когато необходимостта да ни ръководи и напътства ще е отминала. 

### <h3 id="question-91">ВЪПРОС No.91</h3>

Казано ни е, че ‘’Бог толкова много обичал света, че дал своя единствен възлюбен Син, така че който вярва в Него няма да умре, а ще има вечен живот’’. Как можем да съчетаем тази идея с думите на Христос, ‘’Аз дойдох не да донеса мир, а меч’’? 

Отговор: Казано е, че ‘’законът и пророците са били преди Христос’’, и има четири стъпала по които човек се изкачва до Бога. Първо, когато съзнанието му се събужда за Физическия Свят и е на етапа на съществуване като първобитен човек, той се озовава заобиколен от други хора, които под влиянието на силно стресиращите условия са принудени да се борят за живот, хора за които ‘’силата е правото’’; тук той се учи да се уповава на своята собствена сила която да го спасява от дивите животни и от другите хора. Но той осъзнава около себе си и природните сили, и от тях се страхува защото узнава способността им да убиват и своята собствена немощ да се справя с тях. Затова той започва да почита Бога, желаейки да омилостиви Бога от който се страхува с кръвни жертвоприношения. 

След това идва времето когато той започва да гледа на Бог като на директно намесващ се, даващ или наказващ, който ще го награди тук и сега за подчиняването на неговия закон и ще го накаже веднага за неподчинението му. Мощен съюзник срещу враговете, но и силен враг също така и затова от него трябва да се страхува. И така, той го почита и възхвалява и принася в жертва животни от страх и защото представляват ценност за него. 

След това настъпва етапът когато се е научил да почита един Бог от Любов и да принася в жертва себе си ден след ден през целия си живот, за една награда в бъдещо състояние, в което той трябва да вярва чрез вяра, и което дори не е ясно очертано. 

Накрая човек ще достигне етапа когато ще познае своята божественост и ще върши добро заради самото добро, без мисъл за страх и без влияние отвън. 

Евреите са достигнали втория от тези етапи и са живеели под господството на закона. Християнската религия постепенно работи за третия етап, но още не е освободена от втория. Всички ние сме все още под закона създаден от Бог с цел да обуздаем нашето тяло на желанията чрез страх, но за да напреднем в духовното си развитие от тук нататък, ние трябва да направим чувствително нашето витално тяло което се поддава лесно на въздействието на любовта, но никак не е възприемчиво за закона, който управлява природата на желанията. 

С цел да се подготви този идващ етап, духовниците които са били по-напред в развитието си от обикновените хора, са били държани отделени от тях. Чуваме, че на Изток само определена каста, Брахмините, са имали позволение да влизат в храмовете и да извършват службите там. Сред евреите, само Левитите са имали позволение да се приближават до святото място и сред другите нации е било така. Духовниците винаги са били отделна класа на която не е било разрешено да сключва брак с представители на обикновените хора. Те са били отделени от другите и отделно съсловие във всяко отношение. 

Това е било така, защото водачите на човечеството са могли да използват само родова линия при която е съществувала известна разхлабеност между виталното тяло и плътното тяло. И така те са отглеждали това духовно съсловие и са събирали принадлежащите към него хора в храмове регулирайки техния живот, в сексуален и във всички възможни аспекти. Но когато Христос е бил освободен от тялото на Исус и е проникнал Своята Същност вътре в цялата земя, завесата е било разкъсана, като символ на факта, че необходимостта от каквито и да било специални условия е отминала. От тогава етерът на земята се променя. Непрекъснато повишаващата се скорост на вибрации дава възможност за съществуването на алтруистични способности. Началото на тези изключително мощни вибрации е предизвикало затъмнението, за което се казва че се е появило по време на разпъването на кръста. Това съвсем не е било затъмнение, а една светлина с голяма интензивност, която е заслепила хората за известно време докато скоростта на вибрациите се е понижила при потапянето в плътната физическа земя. Няколко часа по-късно сияйният Христов Дух е потънал достатъчно дълбоко в земята за да бъдат възстановени нормалните условия. Но тази сила вътре, постепенно набира надмощие и вибрациите на етера се ускоряват повишавайки алтруизма и ускорявайки духовния растеж. Затова условията сега са такива, че не съществува необходимостта от специална или привилегирована група от хора, а всеки един може да се стреми да встъпи в пътя на посвещаването. 

Старите условия отмират трудно; под управлението на Йехова, Духът на Луната, човечеството е било разделено на нации и за да бъде в състояние да ги ръководи, било е необходимо понякога Той да използва една нация срещу друга, защото човечеството тогава не е било способно за любов – то би се подчинявало само на силата и страха. Преди да може да се установи Всеобщото (или Универсалното) Братство на Любовта, е необходимо нациите да бъдат ликвидирани, по същия принцип по който ако имаме няколко сгради, изградени от тухли, и искаме да построим от тях една голяма сграда, първо е необходимо да ги разрушим до съставните им части за да имаме на разположение единични тухли за общата сграда. Затова Христос казва: ‘’Аз дойдох не да донеса мир, а меч’’. 

Ние трябва да надрастнем патриотизма и да се научим да казваме като тази велика душа Томас Пейн: ‘’Светът е моята родина, и да върша добро е моята религия’’. До тогава, трябва да има войни и колкото повече, толкова по-добре, защото по този начин толкова по-скоро ужасът ще стане достатъчно ужасяващ за да наложи мир. 

През святата нощ, когато детето Христос е било родено, ангелите са пеели: ‘’Мир на земята и благоговеене измежду човеците’’. По-късно детето пораснало и казало: ‘’Аз не дойдох за да донеса мир, а меч’’, и Християнската религия е била най-кървавата от всички религии на човешкия род. Тя е носила опустошение и мъка със себе си навсякъде, но накрая от всичко това ще се роди денят, когато песента на Ангелите ще стане истина и думите на Христос за любов към ближния, изречени по друг повод, ще се изпълнят с живот. Когато мечът е свършил своята работа ще бъде изкован в плуг и няма да има повече война, защото няма повече да има нации. 

### <h3 id="question-92">ВЪПРОС No.92</h3>

Какво се има пред вид вечно спасение и проклятие? 

Отговор: Ортодоксалните религии твърдят, че тези които са имали праведен живот са спасени, така да се каже, те ще отидат на небето, не много ясно дефинирано място, и тези които не са успели да постигнат това спасение ще бъдат напъхани в един ад, за който не се знае много, освен че е ужасно място. Добрите и лошите остават на съответните си места след като са получили присъдата; няма избавление за изгубените души и никаква заплаха за пропадане за тези които някога са били спасени. 

Такава интерпретация е погрешна в основата си. Ако е взет гръцкия речник като еталон, защото очевидно, смисълът зависи от думата преведена като ‘’вечно’’. Тази дума е aionian и в речника е дадена със значение: ‘’дълго време, един неопределен период, времето за един живот’’. Какъв е истинският смисъл на цитирания пасаж, бихме си задали този въпрос, и за да се открие какъв е смисълът ще е необходимо да се разгледа задълбочено и обширно същността на живота. 

В началото на проявлението, Бог, един могъщ пламък, диференцира голям брой пламъци или искри в зародишно състояние вътре в Себе си, не от Себе си, защото признат факт е, че ‘’в Него ние живеем и се движим и имаме своето съществувание’’. Нищо не може да съществува извън Бог. Така вътре в Себе си, Бог диференцира тези безбройни души. Всяка от тях е потенциално божествена, всяка съдържа всичките му сили и способности, както семето съдържа в себе си растението, но както семето трябва да бъде заровено в пръстта за да израсне растението, така също е необходимо тези божествени искри да бъдат потопени в материални тела-носители за да могат да научат уроци които могат да се усвоят само в такова отделно самостоятелно съществуване, както е на този свят. 

Светът може да се разглежда като тренировъчно училище за еволюиращите духове. Някои от тях са започнали по-рано и са изпълнявали прилежно задачите които са били поставени пред тях: като следствие от това, те са прогресирали бързо. Други са започнали по-късно и са изоставащи. Поради това, те са изостанали в развитието си от своята раса, но абсолютно всички ще достигнат желаното съвършенство. Като следствие на по-горе изложените факти, съществува определен брой класове от тези странстващи духове, и преди дадена група или клас от духове да може да се придвижи на следващата стъпка в еволюцията, необходимо е те да са постигнали определено ниво на опитност (или жизнен опит). Те са спасени от условията на по-ниското ниво, които те са надраснали. След като са овладели определен обем от опитност, те преминават в друга по-горна раса, друга епоха. Но сред мнозинството винаги има изоставащи и те са осъдени да останат в същия клас докато не достигнат нивото на растеж необходимо за преминаване в по-горен клас. Този план (или схема) е подобен на метода по който децата в училище преминават в по-горен клас след годишните изпити, ако са постигнали определено ниво на знания, ако не, те са определени да изостанат – не завинаги, но само докато друг годишен изпит докаже, че те могат да се класират. 

Горе изложеното не е изкривено или неправилно тълкуване на смисъла на думата aionian. Тя е използвана и на други места в Библията по начин потвърждаващ нашето твърдение. Например, в писмото на Павел до Филемон, в което той пише че му връща роба Онесимус с думите: ‘’Може би беше добре, че ти трябваше да го освободиш за известно време за да може да ти бъде върнат завинаги’’. Думата ‘’завинаги’’ е същата дума aionian, която е преведена ‘’вечно’’ във връзка с проклятието и спасението на душата, и ясно се вижда, че в този случай тя може да означава част от времето за живот, защото нито Павел нито Филемон биха могли да живеят вечно. 

### <h3 id="question-93">ВЪПРОС No.93</h3>

Какво е учението на Розенкройцерите относно Непорочното Зачатие? 

Отговор: Доктрината за Непорочното Зачатие е, може би, една от най- възвишените мистерии на Християнската Религия и може би поради тази причина е пострадала от прекалено материалистичното и’ тълкуване, повече отколкото всяка друга мистерия. В еднаква степен е пострадала и от неумелите си защитници и от подигравките на невярващите. Когато, например, наблюдаваме в църквите изображение на Бог нарисуван като един старец седнал горе на небето с тръба в устата си издухвайки детето Исус към Мария, това е повече от смешно, това е абсурдно! 

Популярната, но погрешна идея гласи, че преди около 2000 години един индивид наречен Исус Христос е бил роден от майка без участието на земен баща и този инцидент се възприема като уникален случай в историята на света. В действителност, той не е уникален, непорочното зачатие се е случвало много пъти в световната история и ще стане универсален начин в бъдеще. 

Очакваната предвидима човешка история е написана на звездите – човек, бидейки миниатюрно копие на големите звездни светове. Там идеалът, прототип на непорочното зачатие, със сигурност се случва всяка година. Слънцето е дарител на живот в света; също така то е светлината на света и така както най-напредналите същности (или космически духовни проявления) които са спасители на човешкия род се появяват когато на земята владее най-голямата духовна тъмнина, така слънцето се ражда отново през зимното слънце-стоене и започва своето пътуване към екватора през най-тъмната нощ на годината, нощта между 24ти и 25ти декември. По това време зодиакалният знак Дева изгрява на източния хоризонт за всички северни ширини, където се намират най-гъсто населените области на земята.

Така, светлината на света всяка година се зачева непорочно от божествената девствена майка и засиява по пътя си на север за да даде своя живот на човечеството, като предизвиква узряването на житото и гроздето. По аналогия, духовните учители се раждат тогава когато духовната тъма е най-голяма и дават на човек хляба на живота който храни душата. 

Човек не събира грозде от тръни и винаги се случва едно и също нещо; едно долно създание трябва да бъде родено от майка която също е долен човек, а за да се роди спасител, трябва да бъде избрана чиста девствена майка. Но когато казваме ‘’девствена’’, нямаме пред вид девственост в популярния смисъл. Всички ние имаме физикална девственост в ранните години на своя живот, но духовната девственост е качество на душата придобито през живот с чисти мисли и възвишени стремежи. Тя не зависи от състоянието на тялото. Истинската девица може да роди няколко деца и да остане ‘’девствена’’. 

Дали детето е заченато в грях или непорочно, зависи от неговите присъщи душевни качества, защото ако Его който трябва да се роди е чист и целомъдрен, ще бъде роден от майка от същата чиста и красива природа. И физическият акт, който за повечето хора се диктува от страст и желание за сексуално задоволяване, поради чистотата и непорочността на душата се извършва в духа на молба и жертво приношение. Така детето се зачева без греха на страстта; чрез непорочно зачатие. 

Такова дете никога не е случайно. Неговото идване е било предизвестено и е било очаквано с удовлетворение и радост, и има много случаи в днешно време, когато някои хора се доближават много до Непорочното Зачатие; това са случаи когато двамата родители са чисти и целомъдрени; когато те осъществяват половия акт в дух на чиста любов; когато майката не е била тормозена по време на бременността и така детето е родено по почти толкова чист начин като символичното непорочно рождение. След време, когато човечеството ще става в все по-голяма степен алтруистично, страстта ще бъде заменена от чиста любов и всички хора ще бъдат създавани чрез непорочно зачатие.

Не е ли била Звездата на Витлеем комета? 

Отговор: Не. Звездата на Витлеем свети в среднощния час на всяка нощ както е светила през нощта за която пише в Библията и може да бъде видяна от всеки човек измежду мъдреците днес, въпреки че е скрита за всички останали. 

Ключът за тази мистерия е следния: 

Евангелията не са просто истории на живота на личности; те обрисуват по драматичен начин и в символи това което се случва по пътя на познанието и напредъка; те са инструкции за посвещаване. 

През лятото, когато цялата земя полага усилия да създаде хляба на живота за всички които живеят върху нея, слънцето е високо на небето, изпращайки от там животворящите си лъчи към нашата планета. Тогава всички физически активности са на преден план и човек е напълно погълнат от материалните дейности необходими за неговото съществуване. Но когато през зимата слънцето е под екватора и природата е потопена в сън, духовните влияния изпращани от слънцето са най-мощни. С напредването на физическата тъмнина, духовната светлина се разгаря все по-ярко и кулминира в раждането на спасители през най- тъмната нощ на годината, между 24ти и 25ти декември, времето когато слънцето започва своето пътуване на север за да спаси човешкия род от студ и глад, които биха настъпили ако то останеше на южните географски ширини. 

През тази нощ на годината духовните вибрации са най-силни. Тя е Святата Нощ на годината, върховната. През тази нощ за ново-посветения е най-лесно да влезе в съприкосновение с духовните вибрации в пълно съзнание. Затова е било обичайно да се приемат ново-посветените в храмовете през тази Свята Нощ. Там те са били привеждани в транс под ръководството на мъдреци и обучавани да напускат тялото си в пълно съзнание с един волеви акт. Тогава земята е ставала прозрачна за тяхното зрение и те са виждали зад нея слънцето в среднощния час – ярко пламтящата звезда. Не, разбира се, физическото слънце а духовното слънце, което е истинската Христова звезда, защото космическият Христос е най- високо Посветения измежду сияйните слънчеви духове, Архангелите. 

### <h3 id="question-95">ВЪПРОС No.95</h3>

Какво са били даровете на мъдреците? 

Отговор: В Библията се казва, че те са били злато, мирта и тамян. 

Златото винаги е било смятано за емблема на духа в древните легенди и символизъм. В историята за Пръстена на Нибелунгите, на базата на която Вагнер е създал опера, ние научаваме как рейнските русалки са играели в тяхната водна среда на дъното на река Рейн. Водата е била осветена от греещо злато. Тази легенда ни връща назад във времето, когато хората на мъглата са живеели в условията на чудната ранна Атлантида, когато те са били едно голямо братство, невинни като деца и Универсалният (или всеобщият) Дух още не е влязъл в отделни тела. 

Златото лежащо на скалата на дъното на реката е символ на Универсалния Дух огряващ цялото човечество. По-късно то е откраднато и претопено в пръстен от Алберих, Нибелунгът, който лъжливо се заклева в любов за да притежава този пръстен. Тогава златото става символ на отделния Его в днешния лишен от любов период на егоизъм. Човекът, който е станал мъдър и разбира злото на себелюбието, предлага злато на Христос като символ на своя стремеж да се върне към Универсалния дух на Любовта. 

Вторият дар, миртата, е ароматично растение от арабските страни, което се среща много рядко. То е символ на душата. Има легенди за светци, чиято святост е била толкова голяма, че те са излъчвали аромат. Смята се, че това са набожни измислици, но това е наистина факт, че човек може да стане толкова свят че да започне да излъчва прекрасен мирис. 

Третият дар, тамянът, е символ на плътното тяло, което е било преобразувано в етерно чрез свят живот, защото тамянът е излъчване на изпарения от физически обект. Министърът на вътрешните работи на Сърбия, един от конспираторите които замислиха цареубийството в страната преди по-малко от 10 години, е написал следното в своите мемоари. Получава се, според него, така че когато са предлагали на хора да участват в тяхната конспирация и са горили тамян, те неизменно са имали успех във вербуването им. Той не знае защо, той просто споменава това като любопитно съвпадение. Но за окултиста нещата са ясни. 

Никой дух не може да функционира в който и да е свят без тяло-носител изградено от материята на този свят. За да функционираме във Физическия Свят, за да дишаме и да се движим, ние трябва да имаме плътно тяло и витално тяло; двете тела са направени от различни групи физическа материя: твърди тела, течности, газове и етери. Ние можем да придобием такива тела по обикновения начин, минавайки през утробата до раждането, или ние можем да извлечем етер от тялото на един медиум и временно да го използваме за материализиране, или ние можем да използваме изпаренията на тамян. В Католическата църква, където се призовават определени духове, тамянът доставя телата в които те могат да действат пред събраното паство, както обезплътени духове са действали в полза на сръбската афера за цареубийство. 

И така, разбираме че даровете на мъдреците са дух, душа и тяло, като служба и преклонение пред човечеството. Да дариш себе си, е като да се стремиш да правиш като Христос, да Го следваш в Неговите стъпки. 

### <h3 id="question-96">ВЪПРОС No.96</h3>

Не е ли бил Исус евреин? Ако е така, какво е имал пред вид когато казва: ‘’Преди да беше Аврам, Аз съм’’? Защото дори и да се е преродил, Аврам е бил бащата на Еврейската раса. 

Отговор:През миналото, а дори и до ден днешен, на патриотизма се гледа като на един от първостепенните добродетели, но от окултна гледна точка има само Един Дух, и расите са само преходна фаза в схемата на еволюцията; всъщност много опасна фаза, защото докато през Периодите и Великите Епохи на еволюцията има изобилие от време и водачите на човечеството имат възможност да доведат повечето от духовете в групата на класиралите се за издигане на по- високо ниво, расите и нациите са родени и ще умрат за толкова кратко време, че съществува голяма опасност духовете да се закотвят в расовите тела и да престанат да следват голямата част от човечеството в своя напредък. 

Точно това се е случило с евреите. Техния патриотизъм е бил толкова интензивен, че никой евреин не се е възприемал като индивидуалност. Първо, той би казвал за себе си че е ’’Аврамово семе’’. Второ, той смята че принадлежи на определен род, и най-накрая, може би той е Соломон Леви или Мойсей Коен. 

Христос се е борил с тази идея за идентичност с расата като е казал: ‘’Преди да беше Аврам, Аз съм’’. Его е съществувал преди Аврам, Аврам е бил една инкарнация на един Его, един дух. Той и еврейската раса произлязла от него, са били просто тела, но Его които са обитавали тези тела са съществували преди расовите тела. Затова Христос съветва слушателите си да виждат през преходното вечното. 

На друго място Той казва: ‘’Докато един човек не изостави баща и майка, той не може да ме следва’’. Бащата и майката са също расови тела. Ние нямаме право да изоставим близките си които зависят от нас за да следваме духовно извисен живот; ние сме длъжни да изпълним всичките си задължения тук, преди егоистично да започнем да изучаваме духовно извисения начин на живот, но не трябва да се идентифицираме с расата, с нацията или със семейството в което сме родени. Всеки един от нас е индивидуален дух, който е съществувал преди телата които наричаме родове и ще съществува след като тях вече няма да ги има. Пропускайки да се съобразяваме с това, ние може да застинем във формата и да останем с рода, вместо да прогресираме. Точно това са направили евреите. Техният силен патриотизъм е причината за това те като духове да реинкарнират в еврейски расови тела в продължение на хилядолетия. 

Водачите на човечеството са прилагали различни начини да ги накарат да се амалгамират с другите, така че да се осъществи прогрес, но винаги напразно, и Христос е бил изпратен при тях поради същата причина поради която и Booker T. Washington е бил изпратен при негрите. Въпреки че е бил по-напреднала душа отколкото неговите расови братя, той е бил прероден в черно тяло за да му даде възможност да помогне на негрите по най-ефикасен начин. Ако е бил въплътен в бяла кожа, винаги щеше да има елемент на покровителство. Подобни причини са наложили раждането на Христос като евреин. Имало е надежда, че те ще приемат Неговото учение като учение на един от техния собствен род. Но вместо да почита техните традиции и да благоговее пред Аврам, Той отрекъл техните идеали. Той говорел за нови небеса и нова земя, Той защитавал приоритета на личността пред рода и затова те не биха могли да приемат нищо от Него – ‘’те избраха Варнава’’. 

### <h3 id="question-97">ВЪПРОС No.97</h3>

Исус е бил кръстен на тридесет години, приемайки ‘’Христовия Дух’’. Моля, обяснете това кръщаване. 

Отговор: Земята не винаги е била такава каквато е сега. Науката твърди, че е имало времена когато тя е била смес от огнена мъгла. Библията ни връща дори по-назад и дава описание на времето когато земята се е нажежила и е започнала да свети като огън; и време когато преобладавала тъмнина. 

Всички тези четири епохи или етажи от развитието на земята са съществували. Първо е била фазата на тъмнината, която е наречена ‘’Поларианска’’ Епоха в Розенкройцерската терминология. Тогава субстанцията, която сега формира земята, е била тъмна маса, гореща и газообразна. През втория етап, наречен Хипербореанска Епоха, тази тъмна маса се възпламенила. Казано е ‘’Бог каза: Да бъде светлина, и беше светлина’’. След това е настъпил етапа когато високата температура на тази огнена мъгла в контакт със студеното космическо пространство е генерирала влага, и тази влага е била най-гъста близо до огненото ядро, където отново допълнително е бивала нагрявана до изпаряване и парата се е движила в посока от центъра към периферията – ‘’Бог разделил водите от води’’, разделена е плътната вода, която е най-близо до ядрото, от леката пара отвън. Най-накрая се е появило вкоравяване, което се случва винаги когато вода се нагрява до кипене отново и отново и в следствие на това е била образувана кората на земята, сушата. 

Когато било завършено формирането на тази кора не е имало вода на повърхността на земята, но както пише в Библията ‘’мъгла се повдигна от повърхността’’ и още не е имало нито едно растение на повърхността на земята. Тогава, обаче, е започнал да се появява растеж и зараждащото се човечество започнало живота си там. Но хората не са били устроени така както сме ние днес. тяхната фигура е била много различна от сегашната и те са били много далеч назад в развитието си, отколкото сме ние сега. Фактически, тяло и дух не са били перфектно съединени, духовете са се реели частично извън тялото и затова ‘’очите на човека не са били още отворени’’. 

Стари народни приказки, каквито има в Германия и на други места в Стария Свят, наричат тези хора Нибелунги. ‘’Niebel‘’ означава мъгла и ‘’ungen‘’ означава дете. Те са били ‘’децата на мъглата’’ защото тогава ясната атмосфера която замята има днес, не е съществувала; слънцето изглеждало като улична лампа през много мъглив ден, поради гъстотата на мъглата която се издигала от земята. 

Хората, живели през този етап, не са имали такова ниво на умствено развитие както сега. Те не са могли да виждат обектите извън и около тях, но те са имали едно вътрешно възприемане. Те са виждали душевните качества на всичко което е живеело около тях и те са възприемали себе си повече като духовни, отколкото като материални. По това време изобщо не е имало нации, човечеството е представлявало едно голямо братство. Всички са се намирали частично извън своите тела и поради това в съприкосновение с Универсалния (или Всеобщия) Дух, чието съществуване сега изглежда съмнително в отделността на егоцентризма, което предизвиква всеки човек да се чувства различен и отделен от останалото човечество; където братството е забравено и властва себичността. 

Когато един човек ще е напреднал толкова, че да може да оцени голямата благодат на братството, когато той ще полага усилия да преодолее егоизма и да култивира алтруизъм, на него ще му бъде позволено да премине през обреда на кръщаването. Той влиза във водата като символ на своето връщане към идеалните условия на братството, които са съществували когато целият човешки род е живял, с други думи, във водата. Затова виждаме Христос, вестителят на Универсалното Братство, в началото на своята мисия стъпващ във водата на Йордан и кръщаван там. Когато се издига от водите, Универсалният (или Всеобщият) Дух е кацнал върху него като гълъб и от този момент нататък, той вече не е Исус а Христос Исус, бъдещият спасител на Света напоен с Универсалния Дух, който в бъдеще ще отнеме всичкото зло на себелюбието и ще възстанови цялата благодат на братството за човечеството, което ще се осъществи когато Универсалният Дух стане свойствен за всички хора.

Във вашето учение вие твърдите, че ние оставаме средно около една трета от земния си живот в Чистилището, за да могат да бъдат изкупени нашите грехове преди да отидем на небето. Как тогава вие съвместявате това учение с казаното от Христос към умиращия крадец: ‘’Днес ти ще бъдеш с мен в Рая’’? 

Отговор: Новия Завет е бил написан на гръцки, един език в който не се употребяват никакви препинателни знаци. Препинателните знаци в нашата Библия са били вмъкнати по-късно от нашите преводачи на Библията и пунктуацията, често, много радикално променя смисъла на едно изречение, както следният разказ ще илюстрира: 

Когато миряните от някаква църква са се събрали за молитва, някой е дал на пастора молба за молитва написана на лист, която той е прочел по следния начин: ‘’Един моряк е отплавал в морето, неговата тъща желае молитвите на паството за неговото безопасно завръщане при съпруга и дете’’ (A sailor going to sea, his mother-in-law desires the prayers of the congregation for his safe return to wife and child). Молбата не е имала никакви препинателни знаци, но би се подразбрало, че тъщата на младия мъж е загрижена той да се завърне безопасно при съпругата и детето си и затова желае молитвите на паството. Ако пасторът я беше прочел без запетайката, би се подразбрало че морякът отишъл да посети своята тъща желае молитвите на паството за своето безопасно завръщане при съпругата и детето си, и някой естествено би си помислил че въпросната дама е самия дявол, щом е било необходимо младият мъж да моли за молитвите на паството преди да се срещне с нея*. В този смисъл, ако думите на Христос се четат по следния начин: ‘’Наистина ти казвам днес, ти ще бъдеш с мен в Рая’’, това ще значи, че крадецът ще бъде с Христос през някакво неопределено бъдеще време. Но ако се сложи запетая пред думата днес, както е в Библията, ще се получи смисъла който е известен на хората. 

() - sea = море; sea = виждам, посещавам, срещам се с  

Че този смисъл е напълно погрешен, може да се види от забележката на Христос веднага след възкръсването му, когато казва на жената: ‘’Не ме докосвай защото още не съм се възнесъл при моя Отец’’. Ако Той е бил обещал на крадеца че той би бил с него в Рая през същия ден на разпъването на кръста и три дена по-късно заявява, че Той още не е там, Христос би могло да бъде обвинен в лъжливо обещание, което разбира се е невъзможно. Поставянето на запетаята, както предположихме, напълно променя смисъла на двата пасажа и между другото Петър ни казва, че в промеждутъка от време Той е работил с духовете в Чистилището. 

### <h3 id="question-99">ВЪПРОС No.99</h3>

Какъв е езотеричният смисъл на двамата крадци и на кръста? 

Отговор: Противно на общоприетото мнение, четирите евангелия съвсем не са биографията на Исус Христос; те са Инструкция (Формула) за посвещаване на четири различни Езотерични Школи, и за да бъде завоалиран езотеричния им смисъл, изложени са и живота и мисионерството на Христос. Това лесно може да бъде направено защото всички посветени, като действащи лица на космическата сцена, имат подобни преживявания. Истина е написаното за Христос, че е говорил на множеството с притчи, но скрития смисъл е бил даден на учениците му в уединение. Павел също е давал мляко на слабите и месо на силните. Никога не е съществувало намерение тайните символи да бъдат предоставени на обикновените хора, или Библията да бъде направена ‘’разтворена книга на Господ’’, както хората винаги са вярвали че е. 

Когато четем в паметта на природата, откриваме, че по времето на разпъването на кръста не е имало само двама, а повече на брой разпънати. Хората по това време са били осъждани на смърт за най-малкото престъпление и винаги е имало много които са страдали при тази варварска смърт. Затова, тези които са искали да завоалират скрития смисъл на евангелията, лесно са можели да намерят какво да представят като приказка и да забулят местата които наистина са съществени в епизода за разпъването на кръста. Тази част от историята която се отнася до крадците, поради това, е наистина несъществен епизод, без да има изобщо нищо общо с езотерическия смисъл. 

### <h3 id="question-100">ВЪПРОС No.100</h3>

Какво означава кръста? Дали той просто е един инструмент за мъчения, както обикновено се смята в ортодоксалната религия? 

Отговор: Както при всички други символи, значенията на смисъла на кръста са много. Plato дава едно от тези значения като казва: ‘’Световната душа е разпъната на кръст’’, с други думи: На света има четири царства – минерала, растението, животното и човека. 

Минералното царство одушевява всички химически субстанции от всякакъв вид, така че кръстът, направен от какъвто и да е материал, е на първо място символ на това царство. 

Вертикалната по-долна част на кръста е символ на растителното царство, защото токовете на груповите духове които дават живот на растенията идват от центъра на земята където се намират тези групови духове и достигат нагоре периферията на нашата планета и космическото пространство. 

Горната част вертикала на кръста е символ на човека, защото жизнените токове на човешкото царство се спускат надолу от слънцето през вертикалния гръбнак. Затова човек представлява обърнато растение, защото както растението поема храната си чрез корените предвижвайки я нагоре, така човек поема храната си чрез главата предвижвайки я надолу. Растението е целомъдрено, чисто и безстрастно и протяга своя творчески орган , цвета, целомъдрено и без срам нагоре към слънцето, прекрасно нещо. Човек обръща своя изпълнен със страст размножителен орган към земята. Човек вдишва животворящия кислород и издишва отровния въглероден двуокис. Растението поема отровата издишана от човек изграждайки тялото си с нея и ни връща еликсира на живота, пречистения кислород. 

Между растителното царство и човешкото царство се намира животното с хоризонталния гръбнак и в хоризонталния гръбнак токовете на живота на груповия дух на животното действат, защото те кръжат около глобуса. Затова хоризонталната част на кръста е символ на животинското царство. 

В езотеризма, кръста никога не е бил разглеждан като инструмент за мъчения и до началото на шести век не е имало изображения на разпънат Христос. Преди това символът на Христос е бил кръст и едно агне легнало до основата му, за да предаде идеята, че по времето когато е бил роден Христос, Слънцето в точката на пролетното равноденствие е пресичало екватора в знака Овен, Агнето. Символите в различните религии винаги са били създавани по такъв начин. Когато слънцето вследствие на прецесията е пресичало пролетното равноденствие в знака Телец, Бикът, е била основана религия в Египет при която са се молели на Бика Апис по същия начин както ние почитаме Агнеца Божи. Чували сме за още по-стари времена, когато Norse God Thor подкарал своите кози близнаци по небето. Това е било времето когато пролетното равноденствие се е намирало в знака Близнаци, Близнаците. По времето на раждането на Христос, пролетното равноденствие е съвпадало приблизително със седмия градус на Овен, Агнето, затова нашият Спасител е бил наречен Агнец Божи. Имало е дискусия през по-ранните векове относно целесъобразността на това да имаме агне като символ на нашия Спасител. Някои твърдят, че пролетното равноденствие по време на Неговото раждане е било в действителност в знака Риби, Рибите, и че символът на нашия Спасител трябва да бъде риба. В памет на тази дискусия и сега митрата на епископите има формата на глава на риба. 

### <h3 id="question-101">ВЪПРОС No.101</h3>

Не би ли могла мисията на Христос да се изпълни без такъв жесток метод като разпъването на кръст? 

Отговор: Би могла, разбира се, да се изпълни без точно този метод разпъване на кръст, но е било абсолютно необходимо кръвта да изтече. Има духовни учители на различни нива и на тях са им необходими различни условия за изпълнението на техните задачи. Някои учители, като Мойсей и Буда, са се появили сред даден народ и са му помогнали до определено ниво, като при това те самите са израствали; и двамата споменати учители са постигнали в своето развитие нивото, при което техните тела са започнали да излъчват светлина. Известно е, че лицето на Мойсей така е светело, че е трябвало да използва покривало. Буда е започнал да свети по време на смъртта си. Христос е постигнал нивото на излъчване на светлина по време на своето преображение и много важна част от Неговата работа, Неговото страдание и смърт, се е извършила след преображението. И докато за Мойсей, Илия, Буда и други по-ранни учители е станало необходимо да се раждат във физическо тяло отново и отново за да понасят греховете на своите хора, Христос се е появил само веднъж във физическо тяло и не трябва отново да използва за себе си такъв инструмент. Защото, когато духът напуска тялото по естествен начин, той взима със себе си определени нечистотии докато бавно се измъква от замръзващата кръв. Дори в такова чисто и непорочно тяло, каквото е било тялото на Исус, е имало нечистоти и насилствената смърт която е предизвикала кръвта да изтече освобождавайки Его на Христос от кръвта с бързо изтръгване, изоставяйки зад него каквито нечистоти е могла да има, е позволила на Христос светкавично да излезе от тялото на Исус без бремето на плътта което обикновено съпровожда живота в плътното тяло. 

На същия принцип, факт е, че въпреки че в днешно време има войни за които трябва да съжаляваме поради хуманни съображения, все пак, факт е и той е известен на окултиста, че тези войни са изчистили в значителна степен кръвта на расата, така че постепенно човешкият род става все по-малко изпълнен с ярост и долни страсти и все по-духовен. Също така, може да се каже, че на този факт се дължи осъществяването на изкупление при заколване на животни. Когато човечеството е преминавало през етапа на животинско царство, хората не са имали червена изпълнена със страсти кръв, каквато имат нашите животни; ние не сме били така високо развити. Днешните животни, въпреки че са след нас в еволюцията, се намират на по-висока точка от спиралата и докато ние сега страдаме под закона на причинно-следствената връзка защото трябва да победим страстите си със своя собствена сила, то на животните им се помага и те се намират под надзора на техните групови духове. И когато те ще достигнат човешкото ниво през Юпитеровия Период, те ще бъдат по-висше човечество, освободени от страстите , които са превърнали този свят в такова страдалческо място. Така, че природата винаги превръща всяко зло което сме извършили в по- висше добро. 

Затова в отговор на въпроса, бихме могли да кажем, че в случая на Христос, насилствената смърт е била необходима защото е позволила Христовият Дух да се отдели от тялото на Исус без да задържи нито една от нечистотите придружаващи този просто човешки носител.

Според учението на Розенкройцерите, кога Христос ще дойде отново? 

Отговор: Библията казва, и това е истината, че ‘’деня и часа никой не знае’’, и хората които са се опитвали да фиксират определена дата или определена година за Второто Пришествие, не са разбрали напълно същността на мисията на Христос на земята. Неговото учение е било дадено на човечеството за да може да се премахне закона ‘’Око за око, зъб за зъб’’ – за да може закона на страха (от Бога) да бъде заменен от закона на любовта. ‘’Законът и пророците са били до Христос’’, казано е, но на нас ни е известно, че дори днес законът съществува и е необходим. Затова, очевидно е, че закона не е премахнат с физическото идване на Христос. Явяването на Христос вътре в нас, във вътрешното естество на човек, това е което ще премахне закона. Павел казва за това пришествие като за ‘’Христос да се роди в теб’’, и докато Христос не се е създал в нас, ние не сме готови за Второто Му Явяване. Angelus Silesius е написал: 

```
‘’Дори хиляда пъти да беше роден Христос във Витлеем,   
Но не и в теб самия, твоята душа ще бъде изгубена.   
Напразно ще разчиташ на кръста на Голгота,   
освен ако той не е отново забит в теб.’’   
```

Второто Идване на Христос зависи от това, колко скоро достатъчен брой хора ще са станали като Христос и са настроени на вълната на Христовите принципи, така че както два камертона, настроени на един и същи тон звучат едновременно когато единия от тях е бил ударен, те ще бъдат в състояние да отговорят на Христовите вибрации които ще се появят при завръщането на Спасителя. Поради това, датата на това събитие не може да се определи. Всеки път, когато ние полагаме усилия да бъдем като Христос и да прилагаме Неговото учение, ние ускоряваме Идването Му, затова, нека да се стремим. 

### <h3 id="question-103">ВЪПРОС No.103</h3>

Какъв е смисъла на казаното, че Христос е бил направен висш свещеник завинаги по заповедта на Мелхиседек? 

Отговор: Казано е, че Мелхиседек е бил цар на Салем, а също така и висш свещеник. Казано е също, че неговият сан е бил много по-висок от този на Арон, защото санът му е бил несменяем и непроменим, докато този на Арон и Левитите е бил обект на чести промени. 

През времето за което имаме исторически сведения, винаги е съществувало разделение между светската и духовната власти. Мойсей е бил светски управник и водач на еврейския народ, докато Арон е бил свещеник който се е грижил за неговото духовно благосъстояние и по-нататък през вековете това разделение между църквата и държавата е ставало дори по-ясно изразено, понякога предизвиквайки големи конфликти и кръвопролития, защото интересите на двете власти винаги са се явявали диаметрално противоположни. Но по времето на Мелхиседек, цар на Салем, чийто превод означава ‘’мир’’, не е имало такова разделение, двете длъжности са били комбинирани в една личност. Историята на Мелхиседек, Същество без земно родословие, насочва разбира се, към времето на ранна Атлантида, когато човечеството още не е било разделено на враждуващи нации, а е било едно голямо мирно братство и водачите на хората са били Божествени Същности които са били едновременно царе и свещеници. 

По-късното разделение между църква и държава е бил един от най-резултатните източници на вражда и войни за човечеството защото всяка от тези сили се е борила за надмощие над другата, защото истината без предубеждение е, че никой който не е толкова духовна личност като един свещеник, не може да бъде способен да управлява като цар и никой който не е така мъдър, като един цар би трябвало да бъде, не може да бъде способен за духовно водачество на хората като духовно лице. Ако тези две качества отново ще са обединени в една личност на водач, наистина ще цари повсеместен мир и универсално братство. Христос е бил предвестник на това, като водач способен да обедини църквата и държавата като цар и свещеник след заповедта на Мелхиседек. Неговото Второ Пришествие открива ерата на мир и щастие, където символичният Нов Ерусалим, градът на мира (защото Jer-u-salem означава ‘’ще има мир’’), ще царства над народите на земята, обединени в универсалното братство. Ще има Мир на Земята и Благоволение между Човеците. 

### <h3 id="question-104">ВЪПРОС No.104</h3>

Какво е имал пред вид Христос когато е казал:’’Всички които дойдоха преди мен са били крадци и разбойници’’? 

Отговор: В Библията четем за два големи града, по странен начин подобни, но всъщност напълно различни. Единият е Вавилон, гнездото на безпорядък и смут където хората са престанали да бъдат братя и са се разделили един от друг. Той е разположен върху седем хълма до река и е управляван от цар Луцифер – ‘’дневната звезда’’ – даряващият светлина. Неговото падение от небето е силно оплаквано в 14та глава на Исая, по-късно научаваме за пропадането на този голям град, който е станал непоносимо лош, наречен още блудница, предизвикал война, неприятности и опустошения за всички хора на земята. 

След това, по напълно противоположен начин, ни се разказва за друг град, наречен Нов Ерусалим, имащ почетното положение на мост. В този град няма течаща река, а има стъклено море. Той също е разположен върху седем хълма и е управляван от друг дарител на светлина, който е наречен ‘’светлината на света’’, и това е град на мира чиито порти никога не се заключват, въпреки че в него е скъпоценното Дърво на Живота. Този град не е от този свят, той е град който се е спуснал от небето. 

За да се разбере тази символика е необходимо да се върнем назад в далечното минало, когато човекът – в процес на формиране, не е бил достигнал още нивото на развитие което има днес. Когато той за първи път е дошъл на тази земя, плътното тяло е било изградено през Поларианската Епоха и е било витализирано чрез проникването му от виталното тяло през Хипербореанската Епоха. През онова време, човек е бил като Ангелите, мъж-жена, комплектна творческа единица, способен да създава от себе си посредством излъчването на цялата създаваща потомство (творческа) сила – която е любов. 

По-късно, за човека е станало необходимо да развие мозък и за да бъде осъществено това, половината от творческата сила е била обърната нагоре за да изгради необходимите органи. От тогава насам, човек трябва да желае и да търси кооперирането с някой, който притежава другата половина на предоставената за размножаване сексуална сила. Сега вече, той обича егоистично за да придобие и притежава сътрудничеството на някой друг за размножаването; другата половина от творческата сила, с която той строи своя мозък и ларинкс, той също използва егоистично за да мисли, защото той се стреми към и желае да придобие познание. 

Преди, човек е излъчвал цялата си творческа сила безрезервно, несебелюбиво. След разделянето на сексуалната сила човек е станал себелюбив и поради това, чрез взимането за себе си каквото му трябва, е станал използвач спрямо себеподобните си. 

Ангелите са били човечеството на Лунния Период и от тогава насам са достигнали сегашното си високо ниво на развитие, но както навсякъде има изоставащи, така също и при Ангелите е имало някои които не са могли да достигнат това високо ниво на развитие – клас (или група) от същества които са били в развитието си след Ангелите, но пред хората. Те са се намирали в незавидно положение защото не могат да следват настоящия път на развитие на Ангелите, но също така не могат да потънат толкова ниско в материята като хората. Те не са могли, както и Ангелите, да си помогнат с мозък защото не са имали способността да изградят такъв за себе си (не могат да строят тяло от физическа материя), затова когато хората развили главен и гръбначен мозък, те са видели една възможност при жената, която изразява отрицателния полюс на създаващата сила, въображението, качество което и’ дава възможност да строи тяло в утробата. За да могат да получат достъп до нейното съзнание, тази интелигенция се е възползвала от известна обърканост и смущение, след което са разтревожили жената относно упражняването на нейното качество въображение. 

По онова време очите на хората още не са били отворени; те са били духовни същества и не са осъзнавали напълно че притежават физическо тяло. Жената е била първата, която смътно осъзнала че тя и другите притежават такъв инструмент и тя забелязала, че понякога някой от нейните приятели, за когото преди това тя схващала че има такова физическо тяло, го е загубил и тя е започнала да се безпокои поради това. Тя не е могла да получи никаква информация от Ангелите, но тази интелигенция, която се е появила вътре в нея в змиевидния гръбначен мозък я е осведомила по въпроса и ‘’змията казала на жената: Не каза ли Господ да не ядеш от всяко Дърво в Градината?’’, на което тя отговорила, че на тях им е забранено ‘’да ядат от Дървото на Познанието’’ под смъртна заплаха. Но змията и’ казала: ‘’Няма да умреш, защото Господ знае, че в деня когато ядеш от дървото, твоите очи ще се отворят и ще станеш като боговете, ще познаваш доброто и злото’’. Жената си осигурила участието на мъжа, според инструкциите на Луцифер, осветляващия, и от тогава техните очи са били отворени, те са познали доброто и злото. Но преди това човек не е осъзнавал притежаването на своето тяло; то е отпадало от него от време на време както листата окапват от дървото, без това да му причинява неудобство защото неговото съзнание е било фокусирано в Духовните Светове през цялото време. Но Луциферовите духове са искали да го завладеят, да имат опорна точка в неговите главен мозък и гръбначен мозък. Те са го подстрекавали да се освободи от игото на Ангелите и да вземе в собствените си ръце създаващата ново физическо тяло функция. При често повтаряната и невежа злоупотреба с тази функция, съзнанието на човек е било изтеглено от Духовните Светове и фокусирано във Физическия Свят. След това се е появила смъртта във всичките и сегашни ужасни аспекти, защото сега човек смята своя земен живот за единствения реален живот. Когато той приключи, човек навлиза в едно състояние за което той не знае нищо и от което той, следователно, се страхува. 

Затова, след като той е послушал Луцифер, фалшивия дарител на светлина, човек е станал подвластен на скръб, болка и смърт.. Ограбена му е невинността и душевния мир. Христос е дошъл на света за да спаси човечеството от скръб и смърт. Затова Той нарича себе си истинската светлина, а другите които са дошли преди него, Той характеризира като крадци и грабители, защото те са отнели човешкото духовно зрение, макар и да са му отворили физическите сетива. 

### <h3 id="question-105">ВЪПРОС No.105</h3>

Какво е имал пред вид Христос когато е казал: ‘’Ако някой не приеме Царството Божие като малко дете, никога няма да встъпи в него’’? 

Отговор: В света около нас ние виждаме човешкото царство, където всеки полага усилия да запази и поддържа своята позиция и зависи от своите собствени представи и способности да отстоява тази позиция срещу всички които влизат в контакт с него. Ако му се представи някоя нова идея, неговата мисловна нагласа обикновено са настройва скептично. Той се страхува, че ще бъде заблуден. 

Отношението на едно малко дете към заобикалящия го свят, по отношение на това какво вижда и чува, е точно обратното на това на възрастните. Малкото дете няма това непреодолимо чувство за превъзходство на собствените знания, то е искрено незнаещо и поради това е отворено за обучение, това е качеството към което насочва Спасителят в цитирания пасаж. 

Когато ние встъпваме в пътя на духовно извисен живот, първо трябва да забравим всичко което сме знаели, живеейки на този свят. Трябва да започнем да гледаме на нещата по коренно различен начин, и ако ни се представи едно ново учение, ние трябва да се стараем да го приемем независимо от фактите които сме признавали и съблюдавали преди. Необходимо е да бъдем напълно непредубедени. Разбира се, не трябва направо и безрезервно да повярваме че ‘’черното е бяло’’, но ако някой сериозно твърди, че даден обект който до тогава сме смятали за черен е наистина бял, нашият ум трябва да е остатъчно отворен за да ни предпази от това, прибързано да отсъдим и веднага да кажем: ‘’Защо, аз знам че този обект е черен’’. Ние трябва да поискаме да изследваме отново този обект, за да видим дали няма някоя гледна точка от която предмета който ние сме смятали за черен, да изглежда бял. Само след като сме направили основно проучване и сме установили, че предметът е наистина черен от която и да е гледна точка, можем да се върнем към първоначалното си мнение. 

Няма нищо по-забележително у едно дете от неговата гъвкава нагласа на ума, което го прави така податливо на обучение. И ученикът, който полага усилия да води духовно извисен начин на живот трябва винаги да се старае да държи ума си в такова свободно състояние, защото когато нашите убеждения и представи станат установени и непроменяеми, нашият прогрес се прекратява. Това е голямата истина, която Христос се е старал да поднесе на своите слушатели когато е изрекъл фразата предизвикала въпроса. 

### <h3 id="question-106">ВЪПРОС No.106</h3>

Не е ли ял Христос риба? Защо тогава Розенкройцерите са вегетарианци? 

Отговор: След Възкресението Христос се е появил пред Своите ученици когато те са били в заключено помещение. Те на са Го разпознали веднага и не са повярвали, че това е неговото материално тяло. Но тялото в което Той се е явил е било виталното тяло на Исус и за Него е било възможно, както и за всеки друг способен да функционира в такъв носител, да притегли материя от химическата област около Себе си и да изгради перфектно осезаемо плътно тяло за един момент. За да ги убеди, че е истински, Той е помолил за нещо за ядене и са му дали парче медена пита и малко риба. Твърди се, че той е ял, но не и че е ял от рибата, а някой който е бил възпитаван сред стриктни вегетарианци като Есеите (Essenes) не би ял от рибата и не би ял изобщо месо сервирано пред него. 

Също така, приписва се на Буда, че той е умрял след като е преял с глиганско месо, което е във висша степен забавно за всеки на който е известен факта, че той е учил своите ученици на прост и естествен начин на живот – да подържат тялото си с най-чиста и добра храна получавана директно от земята – и той се е трогвал до болка от страданията на човек или звяр. Езотеричният ученик разбира, че в далечното минало глиганът е бил символ на езотерични знания. Всеки може да дава от тези знания; колкото повече даваме, толкова повече ще имаме, поне същото количество знания остава за нас. Тази истина е отразена в старо-скандинавската митология: Във Валхал, войните които са се сражавали в битката за добро, са били седнали около маса пирувайки с месо от глиган, което било такова, че колкото пъти си отрязвали парче от месото, толкова пъти то моментално израствало наново, така че винаги е имало много без значение колко е било взето и колко е било изядено. Буда през своя земен живот е поглъщал огромно количество от това свещено познание и когато е умрял е бил заситен от него. 

Освен това, задаващият въпроса има погрешна представа. Розенкройцерите не учат, че всеки трябва да стане вегетарианец изведнъж. Всъщност, те учат, че вегетарианският начин на хранене произвежда изобилие от енергия, много повече отколкото месните храни. Тази енергия не е само физическа, но и духовна, така че ако човек води заседнал начин на живот и начин на живот който е ориентиран към чисто материални дейности, заангажиран, може би, в бизнес-трансакции или в други подобни бизнес области, тази духовна енергия няма да може да намери отдушник и ще доведе до нарушения в системата на организма. Само тази, които водят активен живот на открито, където изобилието от енергия генерирана от вегетарианската храна, може да бъде изразходвано, или които превръщат тази енергия в духовни усилия, могат да се чувстват добре при вегетарианския начин на хранене. Освен това, ние признаваме, че наследството от много генерации е направило човек отчасти месояден, така че що се отнася до болшинството от хората, промяната от смесена към вегетарианска храна трябва да става постепенно. Храната която е подходяща за даден човек, може да не е добра за друг, има стара поговорка която гласи: ‘’Храната на един човек е отрова за друг’’, и затова не могат да бъдат дадени бързи и твърди правила които да бъдат приложими за всички хора. Затова, всичко което ядем, както и всичко останало отнасящо се до нашата личност, трябва да се определи индивидуално от нас самите. 

В Библията ясно е казано, че не е това което поемаме с уста, което ни осквернява. Ако ние се тъпчем неистово с лоша храна, силното желание е това, което е грях, но не самата храна. Ако човек се намира някъде, където не може да се снабди с чиста храна която би желал, той би трябвало да приеме храната която е на разположение, дори и да е месо, без омраза и без да се гнуси, със същата благодарност с която приема чистата храна. Тя няма да го оскверни поради неговата душевна нагласа. 

### <h3 id="question-107">ВЪПРОС No.107</h3>

Щом като Христос е нахранил множеството с риба, защо за нас да е неправилно да я използваме, или пък месо, за храна? 

Отговор: Природата на един звяр е такава, че го кара да изяжда всяко животно което среща на пътя си и неговият организъм е устроен така, че той трябва да има такъв начин на хранене за да съществува, но всичко се намира в процес на развитие; винаги се променя в нещо по-висшо. Човек, в неговите минали състояния на развитие, също е приличал на зверовете, в определени аспекти; обаче, той трябва да стане Богоподобен и затова той трябва все някога да престане да унищожава за да може да започне да създава. Евреите са били все още в такова състояние, че тяхната животинска природа е била силна и са имали нищожна нагласа за алтруизъм. Те стриктно са се придържали към закона ‘’Око за око и зъб за зъб’’ и никога не са проявявали милост. Ние сме достигнали малко по-напред по пътя на еволюцията и алтруизмът излиза на преден план все повече и повече. 

Казано е, че във вселената няма друг живот освен този на Бога. Че ‘’В него ние живеем и се движим и съществуваме’’. Неговият живот одушевява всичко което съществува и затова, естествено, разбираме че когато отнемаме живот ние унищожаваме формата създадена от Бог за свое собствено проявление. По- ниско стоящите в схемата на еволюцията животни развиват душевност и притежават усещания.Тяхното желание и стремеж за придобиване на опитност ги кара да изграждат техните различни форми и когато им отнемаме формите, ние ги лишаваме от възможността да натрупват жизнен опит. Ние спъваме тяхната еволюция, вместо да им помагаме. Има извинение за канибала който не знае какво прави когато изяжда себе подобните си. Сега ние изпитваме ужас от канибализма и ще дойде денят когато ще чувстваме същото отвращение при мисълта, че ще направим стомасите си гробове на трупове от убити животни. 

Естествено е, че трябва да желаем най-добрата храна, но всяко животинско тяло съдържа в себе си отровата на разложението. Венозната кръв е изпълнена с въглероден двуокис и други вредни продукти по техния път към бъбреците или порите на кожата за да бъдат изхвърлени като урина или пот. Тези лоши субстанции се съдържат във всяка част от плътта и когато ядем такава храна ние изпълваме нашите собствени тела с токсични отрови. Много заболявания са резултат от използването на месни храни. 

Когато се позоваваме на Библията като достоверен източник за това, че е разрешено да се яде месо, би трябвало да спазваме и нейните забрани и да престанем да ядем свинско, което е най-отвратителната храна изобщо. Признат факт е, че ортодоксалните евреи които не са употребявали забранените в Библията храни, имат устойчивост срещу туберкулоза и рак. 

На много места в Библията, където се споменава ‘’месо’’, пределно ясно е, че не става въпрос за месна храна. В глава Битие (Genesis) където за първи път се казва каква трябва да бъде храната на човек, се казва че той би трябвало да яде от всяко дърво и растение което ражда семена: ‘’и това ще бъде твоята храна’’. Най- еволюиралите хора през всички времена са се въздържали от месна храна. Например Даниил, който е бил свят и мъдър човек, се моли да не бъде принуждаван да яде месо, а да дадат на него и на хората които го придружават, варива. Казано е за хората на Израел в пустинята, че са имали ‘’силно желание за месо’’, и поради това техният Бог им е бил сърдит. 

Има езотеричен смисъл в случая с нахранването на множеството с риба, но разглеждайки го от чисто материалистичен аспект, ние можем да обобщим пунктовете на които се спряхме в нашия отговор, като повторим че по някое време ние ще надрастем използването на месна и рибна храна, както сме се издигнали над канибализма. Каквото и позволение да е било дадено в миналото ни на варвари, то ще изчезне в алтруизтическото бъдеще, когато по-изтънчена чувствителност ще събуди у нас по-пълно осъзнаване на ужаса на доставяне удоволствие чрез месоядство. 

За най-пълно изчерпване на въпроса ‘’Дали Библията оправдава месоядството’’, бихме насочили питащия към малък памфлет със същото заглавие издаден от Unity Society of Kansas City, Missouri, който предоставя доводи за и против с великолепно безпристрастие и показва че е било само като отстъпка към по-горе споменатото силно желание за месо, а не че тази практика е била въобще толерирана. 

### <h3 id="question-108">ВЪПРОС No.108</h3>

Моля, обяснете защо обреченото теле не е било заколено за праведния син, вместо за прахосника. Не е ли било това даване на награда за лоши дела? 

Отговор: Историята за сина прахосник е притча с която Христос е искал да поучи, а не е истинска случка. Това е история, която разказва за пътуването на духа през материята. Има различни класове и групи от духове. Някои, но не всички, са преминали през училището за натрупване на жизнен опит чрез преживявания, светът. Те са се спуснали от техния висок дом в Света на Бога постепенно все по- надълбоко и надълбоко в морето на материята, която ги ослепява. Накрая, те се намират облечени в плътната материя на Физическия Свят. Това е повратната точка когато те се събуждат; когато завършва безсъзнателния път на инволюцията; когато се придобива себе-съзнание плюс съзнание за външния свят. Но вътреживеещият дух няма намерение да остане на този свят. Отново събуденото съзнание за присъщата му божественост го кара отново да се чувства привлечен към висшите сфери и той казва: ‘’Аз ще се повдигна и ще отида при моя Отец’’. 

След това следва трудната работа за отстраняването(обелването) на различните тела-носители в които е бил обгърнат и издигането му нагоре за съзнателно единение с Бог. Докато е зает с тежката задача ‘’Отецът се докосва до него от далече’’; все още слабият вътрешен глас започва да му говори за божествената слава и накрая, когато или еволюцията на човешкия род е била завършена или самичък духът е поел по краткия път на посвещаването, настъпва единението с Бог и с другите братя, които още не са отишли в училището за опитност. Естествено, радостта е много по-голяма при завръщането на някой, който е победил в битката за добро и се е върнал в небесния си дом, отколкото за някой който още не е започнал да се стреми към прогрес. 

### <h3 id="question-109">ВЪПРОС No.109</h3>

Защо Господ е похвалил несправедливия пристойник както е изложено в шестнадесета глава на Св. Лука? 

Отговор: Задаващият въпроса би трябвало да прочете тази глава внимателно. Тя ни разказва за един неверен управител, който е доведен пред своя господар, който подозира че сметките на управителя са неточни. Този лъжлив управител се е спазарил с длъжниците на своя господар за да се подсигури за деня когато ще бъде уволнен. В стих 8 се казва, че ‘’lord* похвали лъжливия пристойник’’. Когато е предал приготвените сметки, той би трябвало да ги е нагласил така умело, че господарят му е бил измамен, защото ‘’lord’’* на този човек – неговият господар – е бил единственият който го е похвалил, което се вижда от факта че думата lord е изписана с малка буква, докато винаги когато става въпрос за Христос се използва главна буква. 

() - lord* - на български означава господар и Господ. И на български език коренът на двете думи е един и същ – Гопод-ар.

Моля обяснете какъв е смисъла на прегрешаването срещу Светия Дух? 

Отговор: Най-общо казано, Светият Дух е творческата сила на Бог. Като потвърждение на това, имайте пред вид пасажа в символа на вярата ‘’Заченат от Светия Дух’’, който, Габриел е казал на Мария, че ще се спусне върху нея. Всичко което съществува, съществува благодарение на тази сила, и лъч от този атрибут на Бога се използва от човек за размножаване на рода. Когато се злоупотребява с това, ако може така да се каже, когато се използва за чувствено задоволяване, било то в самота или при порочна връзка, със или без легален брак, това е греха срещу Светия Дух. Този грях, казано ни е, не се прощава; той трябва да бъде изкупен. Човечеството като цяло сега страда поради този грях. Отслабеният организъм, болестите които наблюдаваме около нас, са били предизвикани от многовековна злоупотреба и докато не се научим да обуздаваме нашите страсти, няма да има истинско здраве за човешкия род. Ние сме родени от родители които са мислили, че е било правилно да задоволяват страстите си по всяко време и винаги. Като следствие от това, ние сега страдаме, а с нашето отношение към секса повечето от нас и сега подаряват на децата ни същите болести. Така греховете на бащите са Божие наказание за децата от генерация на генерация и ще продължават да носят мъка и страдания докато не разберем, че всяко дете има правото да бъде родено при добри условия и да има добри условия през периода на развитие преди раждането.

Християнското верую базира ли се върху божествен достоверен източник? 

Отговор: Съществуват три форми на Християнското верую. Една от тях е известна като Апостолско Верую, въпреки че то не е съставено от апостолите, но се предполага че обхваща техните вярвания. Другото верую е било съставено и прието на Council of Nice и се казва Nicene Creed. Athanasian Creed е с още по- късна дата. Те нямат по-голям авторитет на божествени източници, отколкото всяко друго човешко твърдение относно Библията. 

Самата Библия дава верую, впрочем, в пасажа който твърди че няма дадено никакво друго име освен името на Исус Христос в което човек може да бъде спасен и това е в хармония с окултното учение, защото Йехова е бил авторът на всички стар расови (или родови) религии където страхът от Бог е бил използван срещу желанията на плътта и закона е бил наложен за да ги обуздае. Расовите религии действат поучително срещу природата на желанията, в изложения смисъл, но след време ще бъдат изместени от Религията на Христос. Тази религия на братство и любов ще премахне страха породен от закона на Йехова. Тя ще премахне нациите, с техните закони, с конфликти и борби, чрез влияние и въздействие върху виталното тяло, така че човечеството да бъде подбудено към действие чрез любов, вместо посредством закон. Това обаче не края. Когато царството бъде напълно установено, Той ще трябва да го предаде на Отеца. Религията на Отеца ще бъде нещо по-висше дори от Религията на Сина. 

### <h3 id="question-112">ВЪПРОС No.112</h3>

Как вие съгласувате закона за причинно-следствената връзка с доктрината за опрощаване на греховете? 

Отговор: Невъзможността да се повярва в прощаването на греховете е накарала много хора да повярват твърдо само в закона за причината и следствието, срещащ се в страните на Изтока под името Карма. Понеже в източните религии учението за този закон и за закона за прераждането е по-ясно представено, отколкото в религията на западния свят, Християнството, има също така много хора които мислят, че тези източни религии са по-добри и по-близо до научните принципи отколкото религията на Запада, която проповядва, както популярно се интерпретира, че Христос е умрял за да изкупи нашите грехове и следователно вярата в Него ще ни донесе изкупление. 

В същност, обаче, Християнското учение също формулира доктрината, че ‘’каквото посеем, такова ще пожънем’’, и затова то проповядва двата закона, за причинно-следствената връзка и прощаването на греховете. Тези два закона имат жизнено важно въздействие върху развитието на човешкия род и има причини за това, че източните религии притежават само част от пълното учение което се съдържа в Християнската Религия. 

През онези ранни времена, когато на човечеството са били дадени религиите на Изтока, човек още е имал по-духовна природа, отколкото материалната същност на днешните хора от Западния Свят. Хората от Изтока са знаели, че живеем много животи в различни фигури и форми тук на тази земя. В Изтока, те и днес са напълно обзети от тази идея и като следствие от това, те не са трудолюбиви. Те са много по-заангажирани с мислите си за Нирвана – невидимия свят- където те ще могат да пребивават в мир и доволство, отколкото да се възползват от сегашните материални условия за напредък. Като последствие, техните земи са безводни и необработени, реколтите им са оскъдни и често унищожавани от палещото слънце и опустошителни порои. Те страдат от глад, те умират с милиони, но въпреки това те проповядват закона за причинно-следствената връзка, те изглежда са в неведение за това, че тяхното мизерно съществувание е вследствие на леност и безгрижие относно материалните дадености. Защото, естествено, ако те не са работили тук, те няма да има какво да асимилират в небесния живот между смъртта и новото раждане, а както един орган или крайник който не се използва постепенно атрофира, така и една страна която не се разработва и усъвършенства от духовете които са инкарнирани там, постепенно атрофира и става ненужна като дом на човешкия род. Необходимо е било за еволюцията, човечеството да навлезе в този материален свят и да развие всички негови ресурси. 

Поради това, Великите Водачи са взели различни мерки да ни накарат временно да забравим духовната страна на нашата природа. На Запад, където се намират първенците на човешката раса (или род), те са диктували женитби извън рода. Те са дали на Запада една религия, която не проповядва определено и ясно прераждането и закона за причинно-следствената връзка. Те, също така, са въвели използването на алкохол, който има парализиращо въздействие върху духовната чувствителност на човек. Посредством тези мерки ние в Западния Свят временно сме забравили, че има и друг живот освен този тук на земята и като следствие от това ние се посвещаваме с най-голямо усърдие на работата да направим този свят най-полезен за нас, като мислим че това е единствената ни предоставена възможност. Затова, ние сме превърнали Западния Свят в истинска градина; ние сме създали за нас между инкарнациите една земя, която е изключително плодородна и богата на минерални ресурси които са ни нужни за нашите различни индустрии и така, ние сме завоювали този видим материален свят. 

Очевидно е обаче, че религиозната страна на човешката природа не трябва да се изоставя напълно и понеже Христос, великият идеал на Християнската Религия, е изпратен при нас като пример за следване и ние не може да се надяваме, че ще станем като Христос само в рамките на един живот, за който знаем че е единствения който имаме, трябва да ни бъде дадена доктрина за компенсация, в противен случай ние бихме се отчаяли в напразните си и безуспешни усилия. Затова на Западния Свят е била проповядвана доктрината за опрощаване на греховете чрез праведноста на Христос. 

Също така, очевидно е, че никоя доктрина която не се базира на истински природни закономерности не може да има възраждаща сила, и затова учението за прощаване на греховете трябва да има солидна база за да отмени закона за причинността; тази база е следната: 

Когато наблюдаваме материалния свят около нас, ние възприемаме различните проявления на природата, ние се срещаме с други хора и влизаме в различни взаимоотношения с тях и тези всички образи, звукове и сцени се възприемат от нашите сетивни органи. Обаче не всички, защото обикновено ние сме изключително слаби наблюдатели за детайлите. За съжаление, истина е когато се казва: ‘’имаме очи които не виждат и уши които не чуват’’. Поради тази причина, ние губим много от нашите преживявания. Освен това, нашата памет за съжаление е недобра, ние можем да извикваме от паметта си много малко и повечето от преживяванията ни са загубени за нас защото ги забравяме. Нашата съзнателна памет е слаба. Обаче има и друг вид памет. Както етерът и въздухът пренасят до фотографската плака в една камера образа на един изглед без да бъде пропуснат и най-малкия детайл, по същия начин въздухът и етерът които пренасят това което се случва във външния свят до нашите сетивни органи, пренасят и предават в белите дробове и от там в кръвта действителната картина и запис на всичко с което сме влизали в съприкосновение. Тези картини (или изображения, или информация) се запомнят в една миниатюрна частица (или атом) наречена семенен атом, която се намира в лявата камера (ventricle) на сърцето, и този малък атом може да се смята че е Бележника на Записващите Ангели където са описани всички наши дела. След това този запис се копира в Отразяващия Етер на виталното тяло. 

В течение на един обикновен живот, човек преминава в Чистилището след смъртта и изкупва греховете записани върху този атом. По-късно, той асимилира всичко добро, запомнено там, на Първото Небе и работи върху своята бъдеща околна среда на Второто Небе. Но един вярващ набожен човек осъзнава всеки ден своите прегрешения и това което е пропуснал да стори. Той се замисля върху събитията през този живот всеки ден и се моли от цялото си вярващо сърце да му бъдат простени греховете които е извършил. Тогава картините, в които са били запомнени греховете на извършеното или пропуснатото да бъде извършено, избледняват, тези сектори се изтриват от записа на живота му ден след ден. Защото целта на Бог или на природата не е ‘’непременно да се плати и изравни’’, както би било ако винаги влизаше в сила законът за причинността който неминуемо и абсолютно точно изисква възмездие или заслужено наказание за всяко прегрешение както и награда или компенсация за всяко добро дело. Стремежът на Бог е ние да се учим от нашите преживявания тук делата ни да бъдат справедливи и добри. Когато сме разбрали, че сме сторили зло и сме решени да се поправим, значи сме научили урока и няма необходимост да бъдем наказвани. 

Поради това, доктрината за прощаването на греховете е действителен факт в природата. Ако ние се разкайваме, молим се и се променяме, греховете за които сме се разкаяли, за които сме се помолили и сме се променили, така че вече да не ги извършваме, тези грехове са ни простени и са изтрити от записа на живота ни. В противен случай, те се изкореняват със съответните болки в Чистилището след смъртта. Затова доктрината за Кармата, или законът за причинно- следствената връзка, както се проповядва на Изток, не посреща всички човешки нужди. Обаче, Християнското учение, което обхваща двете, и закона за причинността и доктрината за прощаването на греховете, е по-пълно учение като метод прилаган от Великите Водачи за наше напътствие. 

### <h3 id="question-113">ВЪПРОС No.113</h3>

С каква сила Петър е вдигнал Доркас от мъртвите? 

Отговор: Петър не е вдигнал Доркас от смъртта, нито Христос е вдигнал Лазар или някой друг, нито пък е претендирал за това. Той е казал: ‘’Той не е мъртъв, той е заспал’’. 

За да бъде разбрана тази материя, ще обясним какво се случва по време на смъртта и по какво смъртта се различава от състоянието на транс, защото двете личности които споменахме, са били в състояние на транс когато предполагаемото чудо се е случило. 

Когато човек е в будно състояние, когато Его функционира в пълно съзнание във Физическия Свят, разположението на различните му тела-носители е концентрично – те заемат едно и също пространство – но през нощта когато тялото лежи и спи, се осъществява едно разделяне. Его, облечен в ума и тялото на желанията се извлича от плътното тяло и виталното тяло, които остават в леглото. По-висшите тела се реят близо над тях. Те са свързани към по-плътните тела със сребърната нишка (или корд). Една тънка блестяща нишка която приема формата на двойка фигури подобни на шестици, като единият край е закачен към семенния атом в сърцето, а другият, към централното завихряне (чакра) на тялото на желанията. 

В момента на смъртта, тази нишка се скъсва при семенния атом в сърцето и силите (или енергията) на този атом се придвижват по продължение на пневмогастричния нерв през третия ventricle на мозъка и от там навън през процепа между допиращите се occipital и parietal кости на черепа, по хода на сребърната нишка и влизат в по-висшите носители. Едновременно с това скъсване, виталното тяло също се освобождава и се присъединява към по- висшите носители които се реят над умрялото тяло. Там то остава за около три и половина дни. След това по-висшите носители се освобождават от виталното тяло което се разлага едновременно с плътното тяло, в обичайните случаи. 

По време на това последно разделяне, сребърната нишка също се прекъсва по средата и Его е освободен от връзката с материалния свят. 

По време на сън Его, също така, се извлича от плътното тяло, но виталното тяло остава заедно с плътното тяло и сребърната нишка остава непокътната. 

Понякога се случва Его да не влезе в тялото на сутринта за да го събуди както обикновено, той остава отвън за време вариращо от един до неопределен брой дни. В този случай казваме, че тялото е в естествен транс. Но сребърната нишка не е скъсана в нито едно от двете споменати места. Ако тези прекъсвания са станали, никакво възстановяване не е възможно. Христос и апостолът са били ясновидци, те са видели, че не е имало никакво прекъсване в споменатите случаи, затова е казано: ‘’Той не е умрял, той е заспал’’. Те, също така, са притежавали способността и силата да накарат Его да се върне в своето тяло и да възстановят нормалното състояние. Така са били извършени от тях така наречените чудеса. 

### <h3 id="question-114">ВЪПРОС No.114</h3>

Вярвате ли в преображението? 

Отговор: Със сигурност, но има преображения и преображения. Има едно преображение което се случва по време на ‘’ривайвал-събирания’’ (revival meetings) с биенето на тъпани, с пляскането на ръце, с пеенето на църковни химни и с настойчивото викане на ревайвалиста: ‘’елате преди да е станало късно’’. Всички тези спомагателни средства за преобразяване предизвикват интензивно хипнотично въздействие, което засяга емоционалната природа на много хора по такъв начин, че тези ‘’грешници’’, така наречени, не могат повече да се задържат по местата си и са форсирани в буквалния смисъл да се подчиняват на командите и да се приближат напред до ‘’банката на опечаления’’ (mourner’s bench). Този начин на преобразяване има обикновено много малка стойност. Ривайвалистите откриват, че е много лесно да променят хората по този начин. Изключително трудният проблем е, като един от тях го формулира: ‘’да го направиш трайно’’, защото когато жертвата на хипнотизатора ривайвалист напусне събранието, влиянието постепенно отслабва и рано или късно човек си възвръща предишното поведение. И, въпреки че тези ‘’върнали се към порока’’ може да не чувстват никакво угризение на съвестта когато се върнат към порока, следващото ривайвал-събиране ги привлича към ‘’банката на опечаления’’ отново със същата сигурност както един магнит привлича игла. Те отново и отново се променят и редовно се връщат към порока винаги след като е имало ривайвал- събиране, за забавление на обществото, което е в неведение за това, че става въпрос за случай на лека форма на хипнотизъм. 

Има и друг вид преображение, обаче, винаги придружено от планетарни влияния, и в съответствие със силата на тези влияния преображението, или промяната в живота, ще бъде повече или по-малко пълна и радикална. Това показва, че душата е достигнала определена точка в нейното пътуване, където се чувства привлечена към възвишения начин на живот. Непосредствената причина за преображението може да бъде църковна служба, лекция или книга, стих от Библията, или нещо в природата, но това е само видимата физическа причина за нещо което вече е действителност на духовно ниво. От този момент, мъжът или жената ще придобие нов начин на живот, ще изостави настрана старите грешни навици и пристрастия, ще следва нова линия на мислене и напредък. Това може да промени напълно манталитета му и отношението му към живота, а също така и към обкръжението му. Всъщност, много често едно пътуване го извежда от неговата привична околна среда за да предостави подходящите условия за посяване на ново семе. 

### <h3 id="question-115">ВЪПРОС No.115</h3>

Имат ли някаква стойност изповедта и опрощаването? 

Отговор: Ако задаващият въпроса има пред вид изповед и опрощаване както се практикуват в Католическата Църква, може да се твърди, че свещеникът със сигурност няма силата да опрощава греховете на изповядващия се и практиката на изповядване поради задължаване от страна на църквата, в най-добрия случай е обикновена демонстрация на разкаяние. 

Ако, от друга страна, изповядването се прави в дух на спазване на предписанията, който е истинският начин на изповед, тогава положително има стойност защото както едно малко дете, което е направило нещо лошо, изпитва угризение на съвестта и съжалява, така и ние може да се чувстваме във висша степен разкаяли се за греховете си, когато сме пропуснали да направим добро и когато сме извършили зло. 

В същност, често добрите родители обръщат внимание на факта, че понякога мълчаливото разкаяние не е достатъчно за детето, което чувства нужда да отиде при родителите и да изповяда прегрешението си. Когато е получена прошка от родителите, неговата съвест се успокоява. Същото е и с детето на Господ. Ние грешим и съжаляваме за греховете си; ние решаваме да не правим повече такива неща; но ако може да признаем пред някого в който имаме доверие и да получим неговото съчувствие и уверение, че това лошо деяние няма да бъде използвано срещу нас, ще ни стане по-леко на съвестта. Този принцип е бил основание за предписанието в Библията: ‘’Изповядвайте греховете си един на друг’’. Човекът, на който ще се изповядаме, разбира се, ще бъде човек към когото изпитваме голям респект и любов и в този момент той се явява за нас представител на Бога или на нашата собствена по-висша природа и поради това, получавайки неговото съчувствие, ще изпитаме голямо облекчение. Но, също така ще почувстваме, че решението което сме взели да не извършваме отново този грях, се подсилва от факта, че го имаме за свидетел. Ако изповядването се прави по този начин и по този начин се получава опрощаване, тогава без съмнение има много полезен ефект. 

### <h3 id="question-116">ВЪПРОС No.116</h3>

Имат ли някаква стойност ритуалите на латински използвани в Католическата Църква? Не би ли било по-добре да се преведат, така че хората да могат да ги разбират? И не са ли за предпочитане импровизираните служби и молитви използвани в Протестантските Църкви, пред ритуалите и стереотипните масси на Католиците? 

Отговор: Понастоящем цялото човечество е толкова напреднало в еволюцията, че е над закона, в определени аспекти. Повечето хора спазват закона ‘’Не кради’’, например.

Законът е спирачка за природата на желанията, но там където съществува желание за постигане на окултен или по-скоро за духовен напредък, трябва да бъде завършено, също така, и одухотворяването на виталното тяло. И това се постига чрез използваното в изкуството и религията често повтаряно въздействие, защото за виталното тяло е характерно повторението, както се установява при наблюдения над растенията които имат само плътно и витално тела. Техните стъбла и листа следват едно след друго в определен ред нагоре, те прорастват едно след друго. Виталното тяло е което е изградило прешлените на гръбнака на човек един след друг при непрекъснато повторение. И паметта, например, която е едно от свойствата на виталното тяло, се развива и затвърдява чрез непрекъснато повторение и преповтаряне. 

Когато протестантите са се отделили от Католическата църква, те наистина са изоставили много от злоупотребите, но също така са изоставили почти всичко ценно. Те са се отказали от ритуалите, които всеки може да разбере независимо от лошото произношение на някои свещеници. Знаейки ритуала, паството е можело да изпрати своите мисли в същото направление както мислите на свещеника който чете и по този начин огромно количество от идентична духовна мисъл е бивало концентрирано и излъчвано към общността за добро или зло. Сега, вярващите в Протестантската Църква слушат импровизираната молитва и проповед на своя свещеник, който обикновено не мисли особено за духовната работа която е стои пред него, а повече за това как да подбере по-благозвучни фрази за да погъделичка слуха на своето паство. Хората забравят това което той е казал още преди да са напуснали църквата. Тези които посещават Католическата Църква разбирайки ритуалите и днес са в състояние да обединят своите мисли в духовен конклав и да запазят в паметта си това което са преживели. Така че, всеки път те прибавят по малко към одухотворяването на своите витални тела, докато членовете на Протестантската Църква са повлияни само емоционално и този ефект скоро изчезва. Библията ни учи да се молим непрекъснато и много хора се присмиват казвайки, че ако Бог е всезнаещ Той знае от какво се нуждаем и без нашите молби, а ако не знае, Той не би могъл да бъде всемогъщ и затова нашите молби няма да бъдат изпълнени и няма смисъл да се молим. Обаче, това предписание е базирано на познанието за виталното тяло, което има нужда от повторения за да може да бъде одухотворено. 

Толкова за ритуала. Колкото до използването на латински език, в първа глава на Йоан се твърди, че в началото беше словото… и без него нищо не е направено. Словото е звук. Ако поставим пясък или дребни семена върху месингова или стъклена плоча и след това прекараме лък от цигулка по ръбовете на плочата, ще генерираме звук и този звук ще предизвика образуването на геометрични фигури от пясъка или семената, фигури подобни на кристална решетка. Всеки различен звук образува специфична фигура. Така че, ако определен звук генерира определен ефект който желаем да получим, ние не може да променим звука без също така да се промени и ефекта. Ако издаваме определен звук казвайки ‘’Deum‘’ и след това преведем Deum и кажем Бог, звукът ще бъде много различен и след като даден звук предизвиква определен ефект върху нашите невидими тела, ефектите които са били генерирани от латинския ритуал ще са загубени за Протестантските Църкви които са променили ритуала на английски или въобще са го отменили. 

Често за хората е загадка, по какъв начин Католическата църква запазва мощното си влияние върху своите хора и би могло да се каже, че ако се изоставят ритуалите на латински език, това би изчезнало след десетина години. Нещо повече, истински окултни ритуали не са преведени на английски дори сред Розенкройцерите, ритуали на латински, обаче не тези на Католическите Църкви, често се използват по време на службите. 

### <h3 id="question-117">ВЪПРОС No.117</h3>

Каква е същността на мъченичеството? Дали мъчениците наистина стават светци? 

Отговор: Човек се повдига за единение с Бога чрез четири велики стъпки или етапи. Първо, той се мъчи или се жертва на Бог от който той се страхува и затова се старае да се държи прилично пред него, така че неговият Бог да не го нарани. След това, той се научава да възприема този Бог като мощен съюзник срещу своите врагове и като Бог, който му дава всички хубави неща, стига само да му се подчинява и да му принася в жертва материалните ценности които притежава. На третата стъпка, него го учат да принася в жертва себе си чрез водене на праведен живот и очаква да бъде награден в някакво бъдещо състояние наречено небе, където той трябва да живее във вечно щастие като компенсация за старанието му по време на земния живот. Мъчениците са живеели през този етап, и те са вярвали в това и са били напълно погълнати от идеята за истинността и славата на небесата. Затова на тях им е било лесно да пожертват живота си и след това да се доберат веднага до бъдещото блаженство. 

В действителност, ако мъченичеството би могло да отключи едно небе с вечно блаженство, това би бил възможно най-лесния начин да се получи наградата. Може би е нужна смелост за да се умре, обаче необходима е много по-голяма смелост за да се живее. Ние сме много склонни да мислим, че ако човек е дал живота си, той е дал всичко което има и често чуваме хората да казват за някой който се е самоубил, че ‘’той си е изплатил всичко’’. Всъщност, самоубийството е израз на най-голямата страхливост и мъченичеството би трябвало да предизвиква в много по-малка степен възхищението ни, отколкото живота на хората които ден след ден се стараят да следват духовните напътствия на Библията и водят благопристоен начин на живот. Разбира се, наистина е прието, мъчениците да будят възхищение за това че са останали верни на вярата си пред лицето на смъртта и мъченията. Без съмнение, те ще имат огромни възможности за духовен растеж в по следващи животи, възможности от които са били лишени когато са били изгорени на клада или умъртвени по някакъв друг начин. И бихме могли със сигурност да кажем, че те са били светци и свети хора в такъв смисъл, че тяхната вяра им е била по-скъпа от живота, но твърдо държим на това, че един църковен декрет не е в състояние да направи от един грешник светец.

В една от вашите лекции вие изложихте становището, че е неправилно да се изпращат мисионери в чужди страни; че религиите, изповядвани от така наречените езичници, са понастоящем добри за тях, но че тези мисионери са нанесли за сега малка вреда. Как тогава ще обясните заповедта на Христос към своите Апостоли: ‘’Вървете по целия свят и проповядвайте евангелието на всяко същество’’? 

Отговор: Смисълът на думите на Христос, очевидно, трябва да се търси в интерпретацията на думата ‘’свят’’. Ако под тази дума разбираме цялата земя, може би е правилно да се изпращат мисионери в чуждите страни; но в Библията се казва, че учениците, към които заповедта е била отправена, са се върнали след като са изпълнили своята мисия, показвайки, че думата свят от заповедта не би могло да е замислена като цялата земя. В тази връзка, думата ‘’свят’’ по-скоро трябва да получи интерпретацията ‘’polity‘’, която също може да бъде намерена в някои речници като друг израз на свят. И днес дори, може да се намери географски нос в Испания който се казва Cape Finisterre - краят на земята. Затова този термин, по времето когато Христос е изрекъл тази заповед, не би могъл да обхваща цялата земя, както ни е известна днес. Становището, поради това, не противоречи на учението на Библията. Неправилно е да се изпращат мисионери при хора, които наричаме ‘’езичници’’, защото тяхното развитие до настоящия момент е такова, че те не могат да разберат една религия която проповядва любов към ближния си, една религия която дори ние не сме се научили още да прилагаме в живота си. Освен това, великите Записващи Ангели, които са ангажирани в човешката еволюция, са в състояние да преценяват нашите нужди и да поставят всеки един в обкръжението където той ще намери влияния в най-голяма степен водещи към напредък, също би трябвало да вярваме, че те са дали на всяка нация спасителна религия, която е най- подходяща за тяхното ниво на развитие. Затова, ако човек е бил поставен в страна където се изповядва Християнската Религия, тази религия съдържа идеала към който той трябва да се стреми, но да се правят опити да се наложи тя на други хора които са поставени в други области, би значило да поставим нашата преценка, като по-висша, над преценката на Бог и неговите действащи сили Записващите Ангели. Между другото, както беше казано, мисионерите са навредили малко на хората при които са били изпратени, но те биха могли да направят много добро тук, у дома. Не е нужно да напускаме дома ни за да търсим езичници които имат нужда да бъдат поучавани с Библията. Професор Wilbur L. Cross от Йейл споменава например, че в една група от четиридесет студенти нито един не могъл да каже кой е Юда Искариот; че той имал студент евреин, който никога не бил чувал за Мойсей и че е получил като най-добър отговор на въпроса за същността на Pilgrim Progress, отговора че това е основата на историята на Нова Англия. Ако мисионерите бяха изпратени при тези езичници, може би щяха да направят малко добро. 

По-голяма вреда, обаче, има когато Източният Свят изпраща своите мисионери тук да ни накарат да приемем Хиндуизма и сходни на него религии, защото често тези Хиндуисти проповядват дихателни упражнения които предизвикват психични заболявания или туберкулоза, защото нашите западни тела съвсем не са пригодени за практикуването на такива упражнения. Най-безопасно е да се изповядва религията на нашата страна, да се изучава и да се използва тази религия, оставяйки на другите народи привилегията да правят същото по отношение на техните собствени религии.

### <h3 id="question-119">ВЪПРОС No.119</h3>

Практикуването на способности на медиум вредно ли е за здравето? 

Отговор: Когато един човек става медиум за обезплътен дух който влиза в тялото му, какъвто е случаят на транс-медиумите, когато този дух влиза в притежание на това тяло и го използва както собственикът би го ползвал, тогава се нанася малка вреда или никаква, при условие че контролиращият дух не злоупотребява с възможностите му. В действителност, съществуват някои случаи когато контролиращият дух може да се грижи по-добре за тялото отколкото притежателя му и може понякога да подобри здравословното му състояние. Но духовете, които имат високо етична природа, обикновено не контролират медиум, по-възможно е привързани към земята, груби и низки духове, като например индианците и други с подобна природа, да придобият контрол над медиумистичната личност и когато са в притежание на тялото те биха могли да го използват за задоволяване на желанията си за пиене на алкохол и секс. Така те причиняват увреждания на организма и влошаване състоянието на инструмента. 

В случаите на материализиращ медиум, бихме могли да кажем, че въздействието винаги е вредно. Материализиращият се дух влиза в жертвата и след това изтегля етера на виталното тяло през далака защото разликата между материализиращия медиум и обикновения човек се състои във факта, че връзката между виталното тяло и плътното при медиума е изключително хлабава, така че е възможно това витално тяло да бъде извлечено на голямо разстояние. Виталното тяло е носителят където слънчевите токове ни дават жизненост. Лишено от оживяващия принцип, тялото на медиума по време на материализирането понякога се свива до почти половината от своя нормален размер; плътта става мека и отпусната и искрата на живота едвам мъждука. Когато сеансът е приключил и виталното тяло върнато обратно, медиумът се е събудил и е в нормално съзнание. Тогава той изпитва чувство на ужасно изтощение и понякога, за нещастие, започва да пие алкохол за да съживи виталните сили. В този случай, разбира се, здравето много скоро ще пострада и медиумът ще стане заклет алкохолик. По всякакъв начин практикуването на медиумистични способности трябва да се избягва, защото освен опасността която съществува за инструмента, има и други и далече по-сериозни съображения засягащи по-висшите тела и които по- специално са във връзка със състоянието след смъртта. 

### <h3 id="question-120">ВЪПРОС No.120</h3>

Къде медиумите правят своите така наречени пътувания на душата, какво е това което напуска физическото тяло и може ли то да живее в будно състояние за да събира информация? 

Отговор: Един медиум е пасивен или неволеви ясновидец и е под контрола на един дух от Света на Желанията. Във Физическия Свят той или тя може да се сравни с жертвата на хипнотизатор. Що се отнася до хипнотизатора, той се вижда от своята жертва в будно състояние, докато медиумът не вижда духа който я хипнотизира докато не е изведена от своето тяло. Тогава тя е облечена в тялото си на желанията и затова обикновено не е в състояние да си спомни преживяванията си. 

Всичко което се случва с нея става докато физическото тяло е в транс. Това което напуска физическото тяло е Его облечен в ума и тялото на желанията, същото разделяне се осъществява и при обикновен сън без сънища, с тази разлика обаче, че физическото тяло не е оставено без собственика си, а контролиращият дух обикновено влиза във физическото тяло на медиума, влиза в притежание на това тяло и го използва както желае, често пагубно за медиума. Аащото, когато един такъв контролиращ дух е бил, например, алкохолик или леконравен човек през земния си живот, често се случва той да използва тялото на медиума за да задоволява желанието си за пиене на алкохол или за низките си сексуални инстинкти. Не можем достатъчно сериозно да внушим на хората, че това физическо тяло е нашия най-ценен инструмент, и че е пагубно за всеки да го изоставя на разположение на хипнотизатор или на контролиращ дух и да разчита на милостта им. Що се отнася до медиумите, съществува и още по-голяма опасност, защото понякога контролиращият дух не е обикновен човешки Его, а елементал който не може нормално да функционира във Физическия Свят. Когато медиумът по време на смъртта си влиза в Света на Желанията, елементалът е придобил такава власт над тялото на желанията на медиума, че може да лиши собственика от неговото тяло на желанията. Това тяло е носителят който е източник на подтик и воля за действие, затова когато един Его е лишен от този инструмент, нищо не може да го накара да се реинкарнира. Елементалът може да задържи това тяло за много дълъг период от време, дори за милиони години, и така докато другите хора напредват, този нещастен Его, лишен от своето тяло на желанията е изоставен инертен и може би ще изостане много от своя род, преди да бъде освободен от плена на това същество. Затова, практикуването на медиумизъм представлява най-сериозната опасност за душата, която е известна на автора или която той е в състояние да възприеме, освен практикуването на черна магия. 

### <h3 id="question-121">ВЪПРОС No.121</h3>

Аз съм преживял много полети на душата и по време на едно от тези пътешествия водачът ми ме въведе през порти в един кристален град и след това в един храм пълен с етерни хора като ми каза: ‘’Това е Свещения Град на Бога’’. Бихте ли били така любезни да ми кажете къде е това, защо има порта и стени около града и защо всичко изглеждаше като кристал? 

Отговор: Една от особеностите на обектите в Света на Желанията, които са изградени от материя от Света на Желанията е, че те са изключително пластични и много лесно се моделират от мисълта. За секунда един предмет приема най- различни форми в зависимост от мисълта която го одушевява и когато много хора на земята мислят по един и същи начин всичките им мисли се обединяват, съсредоточават се и образуват едно внушително цяло. 

Затова, в по-долните области на Света на Желанията, мислите на хората които вярват в подобен на пещ огнен ад, правят от веществото на желанията такова място на мъчения. Там можем да видим дяволи с рога, копита и опашки които бодат нещастните грешници с вили и често се случва умиращите хора, които са живели с тази представа и са вярвали в нея, със страх да съгледат това място което е било създадено с тяхна помощ. Също така, в по-горните области на Света на Желанията съществува един град, такъв какъвто Вие го описвате, Новият Йерусалим с порти от перли, с море от стъкло и с величествен бял трон на който седи една мисловна форма на Бог, създадена от тези хора и изглеждаща като един старец. Възможно е Вие да сте посетили това място, което е постоянна отличителна черта на Света на Желанията и ще остане такава до тогава докато хората продължават да мислят за Нов Йерусалим по този начин, защото тези форми нямат друг живот освен поддържащите мисли на човечеството. И след време, когато човечеството е надрастнало това поверие, градът създаден от техните мисли ще престане да съществува. Това, че изглежда като кристален, се дължи на изключителния блясък на веществото на желанията от което е изграден. Старите алхимици са наричали Света на Желанията ‘’астрал’’ и ‘’звезден’’ заради това. 

### <h3 id="question-122">ВЪПРОС No.122</h3>

Телата на желанията, изоставени от предвижващите се Его, не се ли използват от елементали за да заблуждават приятелите и роднините на покойниците? Как те могат да бъдат открити и разпознати? 

Отговор: Когато духът си е отишъл след смъртта, и след престоя му в чистилището за по-кратък или по-дълъг период от време, встъпвайки на Първото Небе той все още има със себе си тялото на желанията което е използвал през земния си живот, но когато се издигне на Второто Небе това тяло на желанията бива изоставяно по същия начин както са били изоставени виталното и плътното тела по време на смъртта или малко след това. Но докато плътното тяло се разпада и разлага и става безжизнено и непотребно веднага след като духът го е изоставил, процесът е различен при тялото на желанията. Материята от която е изградено това тяло е в много по-голяма степен витализирана от Универсалния Дух*, така че то си запазва способността да се движи наоколо дълго време след като духът го е изоставил. Черупката бива привлечена посредством магнитно въздействие към тези с които тя е била свързана през земния живот и споменът за този преминал живот много чести й позволява да позира успешно като починалия близък човек. Такъв е случаят при използването й от елементално същество. 

() - ‘’Универсален Дух’’ – в смисъл на Дух на Унивеса или Всеобщ Дух.   

Тези празни черупки, одушевени от елементали, отговарят много задоволително на повечето феномени явяващи се на спиритически те сеанси. Капеща вода във вратовете на присъстващите, отместващи се столове, маси и други подобни, са образец на това какво може да бъде направено посредством тези празни черупки когато са в притежание на елементали. 

Колкото до това, как могат да бъдат разкрити и разпознати от нас, очевидно е че докато нашите покойни приятели и роднини през живота си на земята са притежавали здрав разум, те не биха могли да имат нищо общо с безсмисленото и глупаво държание на тези празни черупки и съответното ни общуване с тях, защото духът който в действителност е бил нашият близък човек си е отишъл оставяйки обиталището си празно. Поради това можем да ги преценяваме по думите и действията, както преценяваме хората тук. 

### <h3 id="question-123">ВЪПРОС No.123</h3>

Биха ли могли елементалите да приемат формата на гръбначни животни или влечуги и какво може да се направи за да не им се позволява това? 

Отговор: В този материален свят всички форми са стабилни и не се променят лесно. Светът на Желанията е много по-различен в това отношение. Вълшебните приказки и магическите превръщания както в приказката за Пепеляшка са действителен факт в Света на Желанията защото формите се променят според желанието на одушевяващия ги живот със светкавична скорост, което е много объркващо за някой който влиза в този свят като новопосветен. Затова е необходимо ясновидеца да бъде обучен за да не се изуми от вечно изменящата се форма която може да приеме всевъзможен вид във всеки момент от време. Ако сме в състояние да видим одушевяващия живот, без значение каква форма приема той в дадения момент, няма да бъдем заблудени. 

Както всичко останало в Света на Желанията, елементалите имат способността за промяна на външния си вид и този факт е причината за възприемането като истински на толкова много странни измислици или видения от необучени ясновидци. Нищо не може да се направи за да се попречи на елементалите да променят вида си, но можем да ги изпъдим както гоним мяукаща под прозореца на спалнята ни котка. 

### <h3 id="question-124">ВЪПРОС No.124</h3>

Как можем да се предпазим от обсебване? 

Отговор:Обсебване е състоянието когато един дух е влязъл в постоянно притежание на нечие тяло след като собственика е бил изгонен навън. Но понякога хора които са придобили навика да прекаляват с алкохол или с някакъв друг порок търсят начин за оправдание твърдейки че са обсебени. Когато някой човек твърди това за себе си, почти винаги можем да бъдем сигурни че това е нищо друго освен оправдание, защото един крадец който си е присвоил нещо тук на този материален свят не би говорил наляво и надясно за своята кражба, нито пък едно обсебващо същество би си позволило да твърди този факт. Сигурно е, че едно такова същество не се интересува от това какво хората мислят за човека чието тяло то е откраднало, така че няма причина то да разказва за това и да рискува да бъде прогонено чрез ексорсизъм. 

Има един безпогрешен начин за определяне дали даден човек е наистина обсебен, а именно, чрез преглед на очите му. ‘’Окото е прозорец на душата’’ и само истинският притежател е в състояние да стеснява и да разширява ириса или зеницата на окото, така че ако заведем човека който претендира че е обсебен на тъмно място ще установим че зеницата на окото му няма да се разшири, ако наистина е обсебен. Също така зеницата няма да се свие ако го заведем на място със слънчева светлина, няма да се разшири ако го помолим да гледа към далечен обект или да се свие ако е помолен да чете дребен шрифт. На кратко, зеницата на окото няма да реагира нито на светлина нито на разстояние, когато човек е обсебен, но има едно заболяване наречено locomotor ataxia което причинява невъзможност на зеницата да реагира на разстояние, но тя може да реагира на светлина. 

Този който поддържа положителна или активна нагласа на съзнанието не може никога да бъде обсебен, защото докато отстояваме нашата индивидуалност тя ще бъде достатъчно силна за да държи чуждото влияние отвън. Но при спиритически сеанси участниците са пасивно (възприемащо) настроени винаги съществува голяма опасност. Най-добрият начин за да избегнем обсебване, е да поддържаме тази активна нагласа и всеки който има наклонност към пасивна нагласа би трябвало да избягва спиритически сеанси, гледане на кристал и други методи за извикване на духове. Във всеки случай, това е лошо занимание, защото тези които са отишли в отвъдното имат там своята си работа и не би трябвало да бъдат викани обратно тук. 

### <h3 id="question-125">ВЪПРОС No.125</h3>

Какво е това психометрия? 

Отговор: Науката твърди, че всяка частица от материята на Физическия Свят е проникната от етер, така че атомите на всяка химическа субстанция*, без значение колко е плътна, не се допират взаимно, а всеки малък атом вибрира в поле от този все-проникващ етер. Вибрациите на етера излъчвани от всеки обект пренасят до очите ни изображение на предметите които ни заобикалят. Това изображение не изчезва. Картините от всичко, което ние сме наблюдавали съзнателно, винаги съществуват в етера на нашето витално тяло и дали ги помним или не зависи само от способността ни да ги извикваме отново. 

() - Химическа субстанция* - материята изграждаща видимия свят на нашата земя, съставена от твърди тела, течности и газове.   

Също така, в етера който прониква всеки обект, съществува изображение или картина на цялото обкръжение на този обект. На стените на стаите ни са отпечатани всички сцени, всяко събитие, което някога се е случило в тази стая и въпреки че махаме старата мазилка и ламперия не възможно да се отървем от всички изображения които са отпечатани там. Ако вземем парче от мазилката на таква стая и я дадем на някой който е култивирал етерно зрение, възможно е този човек да види етерав това парче мазилка и да разкаже за всичко което се е случило там където тя е била. Ако му покажем парче от камък взето от някоя от египетските пирамиди той ще види тези пирамиди толкова добре както би ги видял на снимка, защото етерът от един обект като пирамидата, е този който осъществява отпечатъка върху чувствителната платка на фотоапарата и единствената разлика между този отпечатък и отпечатъка който ние получаваме посредством окото е, че ние можем да го фиксираме върху фотографската платка и да гледаме снимката по всяко време, докато обикновено все още не сме в състояние ясно да визуализираме картините от миналото си. Но психометристът, който може да разчита етера, притежава прекрасна картинна галерия на свое разположение. 

### <h3 id="question-126">ВЪПРОС No.126</h3>

Вярно ли е, че на спиритически сеанси понякога хора биват пренасяни телом от едно място на друго посредством невидими ръце; че цветя се внасят в стаята през затворени прозорци и врати и ако е така, как може да стане това? 

Отговор: Да, напълно е вярно че такъв феномен, за който споменавате, се случва при определени условия когато не е възможна никаква измама. Относно преместването на предмети, това може да бъде направено от духовете участващи в сеанса по различни начини. Ръце могат да бъдат материализирани и те са етерно видими или невидими. Те могат да пренасят обекти или хора от едно място на друго, но и по друг начин тези обекти могат да бъдат повдигани чрез неутрализиране на действието на закона за гравитацията само за дадения обект. Относно преминаването на цветя през една стена, затворен прозорец или друг материален обект, трябва да имаме пред вид, че тези обекти не са наистина така плътни, както обикновено смятаме. Науката приема факта, че два атома в която и да е субстанция, не се допират взаимно, а че всеки атом се върти и вибрира с различна скорост в море от етер който прониква цялата материя. Също така, добре известно е че всички субстанции могат да бъдат редуцирани до газ. Желязо, камък, вода или каквато и друга субстанция да вземем, може да се редуцира по този начин. Приемайки това, има само една крачка до идеята, че както тези субстанции се свеждат до газообразно състояние и веднага се възстановяват обратно в тяхното първоначално състояние, така и едно цвете може да бъде разложено до етер, да мине между атомите в стената и след това да бъде възстановено обратно в съществуванието си като цвете. Фактически това се случва. 

Но задаващият въпроса би могъл да каже: ‘’Да, но ако вземем една сребърна монета, разложим я в съд за да стане парченца от метали и я изпарим като газ, тя няма да приеме формата на същата сребърна монета когато я върнем обратно в състояние на метал, а ще бъде просто една буца метал’’. Това е вярно ако операцията се извършва от обикновен човек, който не е в състояние да отдели плътната материя от нейното етерно съответствие по време на процеса на разтопяване, но спиритуалните същества, които осъществяват споменатите феномени, могат да отделят етерната част и цветето от плътната материя. И тази етерна част е това което запазва формата си и образува матрицата или калъпа, които придават форма на веществото на цветето когато се появи в стаята след като е преминало през стената. 

### <h3 id="question-127">ВЪПРОС No.127</h3> 

Бихте ли били така любезни да обясните използването на планшета (planchette )? И изложете Вашето становище за това дали е препоръчително да се практикува феномена от аматьори? 

Отговор: Планшетата е малка платформа монтирана върху колела с устройство за задържане на молив във вертикално положение, така че когато ръка на медиум се положи върху платформата и тя се движи наоколо от духове, моливът да изписва техните съобщения върху лист хартия. Както всички други спиритуалистически феномени, писането с планшета се осъществява при участието на безплътен дух чрез пасивен(отрицателен) медиум. 

Когато едно същество е напуснало земния живот и е встъпило в Невидимото Отвъдно, очаква го различна от нашата еволюция в Чистилището и в различните Небеса. Връщане назад е, когато той се опитва да общува с нас тук, в обикновения случай. Затова трябва да се противопоставяме срещу всички спиритуалистически практики които довеждат безплътния дух да контактува с Физическия Свят, защото имат отрицателен ефект върху него. Комуникиращите същества, също така, представляват опасност за присъстващите с пасивна нагласа на съзнанието (отпуснати и отворени за възприемане на влияния от вън) в кръга, които предоставят своята волева сила и своите тела в определена степен. 

Разбира се, при планшетното писане цялото тяло може да не бъде в транс, въпреки че понякога е; но поне една ръка е предоставена на контрола на безплътен дух, който участващият не вижда и който може да бъде или не това за което се представя. Ако някой скитник влезе през входната ни врата и се опита да ни накара да изоставим дома си и да му разрешим да си го присвои за известно време, ние възмутено бихме отказали, но когато един непознат от Света на Желанията иска да притежава нашия най-ценен дом, нашето тяло, много хора веднага се съгласяват и се подчиняват, ласкаейки се от мисълта че ‘’скъп Ангел’’ ги е посетил. Но ‘’скъпите Ангели’’ и филантропите не са по път и над път а Света на Желанията, не са повече отколкото са тук. Никога не е прекалено често да се повтаря, че не съществува трансформираща сила в смъртта; че един невеж индианец няма изведнъж да стане мъдър само от факта че е умрял. Така както е необходимо да се учи за да се придобият знания на този свят, така също е необходимо да се учат и отишлите си духове ако имат желание да придобият познания за условията на онзи свят. И докато не са получили необходимата степен на опитност, отишлите си от този свят не са годни да ни ръководят от там, както не са били способни да ни ръководят тук. Най-безопасно е да се откажем от всички практики с пасивна нагласа на съзнанието, да съсредоточим цялата си енергия за живеене на живота и да развиваме в нас качества които ще ни позволят да встъпим в онзи свят по собствена воля – или предвижвайки се в нашите ефирни тела-носители или като ясновидци разглеждайки го докато сме все още в нашето плътно тяло. Това е напредък, когато притежаваме тази способност ние ще можем да виждаме безплътните същества лице в лице и да си направим преценка дали има смисъл да слушаме техните съвети или не. Докато не можем да правим това, ние сме в по-неизгодно положение и предпазливостта би трябвало да ни научи да се държим на безопасно положение.

Отговор: Не, вампирът е човек който абсорбира виталността на друг човек, докато това което са наричали кръволок през средновековието, е виталното тяло на черен магьосник от нисък ранг. Той придавал ужасяващ вид на своето витално тяло и частично го е подплатявал с физическа материя за да може да причинява вреда на другите хора. В старите народни приказки се разказва, че няма смисъл да се удря и отблъсква такова нещо, ударът няма да го нарани. Но ако бъде пронизано с нож или с друго хладно оръжие, то ще започне да повръща кръвта на своите жертви, ще избяга скимтейки в своя дом и там черният магьосник който се е бил превърнал във вълк, може да бъде открит страдайки от рана точно на същото място където вълка е бил пронизан. Става въпрос за любопитен случай познат на окултистите като реперкусия (repercussion*), същия феномен може да бъде наблюдаван когато дух се материализира по време на сеанс. Етерът, в който такива духове се материализират, е бил взет от тялото на медиума и ако се откъсне парче от обвивката на такъв дух, ще се установи че същото парче липсва от дрехата на медиума в края на сеанса.Този факт е бил използван от скептично настроени изследователи непознаващи принципа на реперкусията, за да обвинят медиумите в измама, които всъщност са били напълно искрени но не можели да обяснят случващото се и да отхвърлят привидно обвиняващите ги доказателства.

### <h3 id="question-129">ВЪПРОС No.129</h3>

Каква е разликата между транс-медиум, материализиращ медиум, обучен ясновидец и обикновен човек? 

Отговор: В общи линии може да се каже, че човечеството днес е разделено на две групи – тези при които връзката между виталното тяло и плътното тяло е много силна и другата група – при тях връзката е по-хлабава. Първата група е на обикновения човек, който е ангажиран в земни дела и напълно е лишен от контакт с Духовните Светове. Втората група е групата на така наречените екстрасенси и отново е разделена на две групи. Едната група е подтиквана към действие от собственото желание и воля на индивида и е активна (Макс Хайндел я нарича положителна). В тази група са обучените ясновидци и Невидимите Помощници. Другата група е пасивна (отрицателна) и се подчинява на желанието и волята на други хора или същества. От тази група са медиумите. 

Когато връзката между виталното тяло и плътното тяло на един човек е по някакъв начин разхлабена той ще бъде чувствителен към духовни вибрации и ако е положителен, той ще развие своите духовни качества по своя собствена воля, ще води духовен живот и навреме ще получи необходимото обучение за да стане обучен ясновидец и господар на своите способности по всяко време и винаги, свободен да ги използва и прилага или не, както желае. 

Ако един човек притежава това леко разхлабване между виталното тяло и плътното тяло и има отрицателна или пасивна психична нагласа, той е изложен на опасността да стане плячка като медиум на безплътни духове. 

Там където връзката между виталното тяло и плътното тяло е много слаба, така че виталното тяло може да бъде извлечено и човекът е положителен или активен, той може да стане Невидим Помощник, способен да извлече двата висши етера от своето плътно тяло и по желание да ги използва за сетивни и възприятия и памет. Тогава той може да функционира в пълно съзнание в Духовния Свят и да донесе обратно спомена за всичко което е правил там, така че например, когато той напуска своето тяло през нощта той пребивава в Невидимия Свят в пълно съзнание, както ние тук когато се събуждаме сутрин след сън и изпълняваме различните си задължения във видимия свят. 

Когато човек има тази много хлабава връзка между виталното тяло и плътното тяло и ма отрицателна или пасивна психическа нагласа, духовете които са привързани към земята и искат да се проявят тук, може да извлекат неговото витално тяло през далака и временно да използват етера от който то е съставено за да материализират спиритуални форми и да върнат етера на медиума след като сеансът е приключил. 

### <h3 id="question-130">ВЪПРОС No.130</h3>

Ако практикуването на медиум е толкова опасно, защо медиумите не престанат да позволяват да бъдат контролирани? 

Отговор: На първо място, разбира се, голямото мнозинство от медиуми не осъзнава, че съществува опасност. От части те са в неведение за огромната опасност която ги заплашва след смъртта. Тялото на желанията тогава може да бъде присвоено от контролиращия дух. Ако те биха се опитали да преустановят влиянието на контролиращия дух докато са още тук в тялото си, те биха установили че това същество ги е хванало много здраво, че е много трудно да се прекрати и спре контрола и те ще разберат че когато смъртта ги отведе в същия свят където се намира контролиращият дух, опасността е дори още по-голяма. 

Авторът познава случаи при които медиуми са отбягвали контролиращия дух и са се мъчили да се освободят от влиянието му, но не са успели да се измъкнат от мощната хватка на това същество. Те са били безпомощни. При автора са идвали медиуми за помощ и са му казвали, че почти непреодолимо са били подтиквани от своите контролиращи духове да се самоубият или да извършат убийство; че те са се молили на контролиращия дух да ги остави на мира, но без успех. Извeстни са също така случаи когато контролиращите духове безмилостно са измъквали своите жертви от леглото посред нощ против тяхното желание и са ги заставяли да слушат досадните им бръщолевения. Много рядко може да се чуе, че някой от тях е проявил милост. Обратното, авторът познава медиуми които са се разболeли вследствие на такова третиране, той е имал само един случай когато болестното състояние на медиума е накарало контролиращия дух да се вслуша в молбите на жертвата и да го освободи за няколко месеца докато оздравее. 

Така че, става ясно, че след като веднъж е започнато упражняването на медиумистичните способности, вече не е въпрос на избор за медиумите; те губят силата си за изключване на контрола на духа. Докато изпълняват заповедите на господаря си и са покорни, те може да не усещат хватката, но ако някой от тях се опита да се възпротиви, тя или той, скоро ще почувства че контролиращият дух има и захапка и шпора и е безмилостен при използването им. 

<h2 id="section-6">РАЗДЕЛ VI: Въпроси отнасящи се до ЯСНОВИДСТВОТО</h2>

### <h3 id="question-131">ВЪПРОС No.131</h3>

Каква е разликата между ясновидец, посветен и адепт? 

Отговор: Какво вижда човек зависи от чувствителността на очите му. Някои хора могат да различават обекти намиращи се на такова разстояние, което ги прави невидими за други хора. Художниците възприемат нюанси на цветовете които обикновените хора не могат да различат, а някои хора са изцяло слепи за цветовете; има дори такива които въобще не виждат – те са незрящи. 

Хората които виждат най-далечни обекти и които различават най-фините нюанси на цветовете са в по-голяма степен ясновидци, или ясновиждащи, отколкото останалите. 

Мнозинството от нас са в състояние да виждат повечето неща от нашето обкръжение, но ние получаваме много малко познания за нещата които виждаме само от наблюдаването им. Ние трябва да бъдем просветени или посветени за начина на използването на телефона, велосипеда, автомобила, пияното и т.н. 

Но въпреки че може да знаем как да си служим с тези средства при обикновени условия, ние не сме изцяло и задълбочено запознати с тяхната конструкция, така че да сме в състояние да ги изработим или да ги поправим когато се повредят. Преди да придобием необходимата квалификация за извършването на тази дейност, ние трябва да изкараме курс за специално обучение и ако дадем всичко от себе си и вложим цялото си сърце, ние може да станем експерти или адепти в нашата област. 

Ако приложим тази илюстрация към проблема който е пред нас, ние може да разберем, че един ясновидец е човек чиято чувствителност на зрението се е повишила толкова, че той възприема другия свят който е невидим за повечето от нас и че той е в състояние да вижда всичко там. 

Но той не ‘’знае всичко за тези предмети и същества’’, които вижда, само от факта че ги възприема със зрението си; не знае повече от това което ние знаем за света около нас който виждаме. Той трябва да положи усилия за да придобие тези знания. Тогава, след като е успял, той ще стане един Посветен, който разбира нещата които вижда и, в обикновения случай, може да борави с някои от тях както ние сме в състояние да свирим на пияно или да караме колело когато сме усвоили тези умения. 

Ще е необходимо допълнително обучение което да позволи на Посветения да упражнява сила върху нещата и да действа в Невидимия Свят като един Адепт. 

И така, Ясновидецът е човек който вижда невидимия свят; Посветеният вижда невидимия свят и разбира какво вижда; докато Адептът вижда, знае и въздейства върху нещата и функционира там. 

### <h3 id="question-132">ВЪПРОС No.132</h3>

Защо се получава така, че един обучен ясновидец не се подлага на някакъв елементарен но убедителен тест проведен от хора на науката, който би убедил всеки в реалността на качествата превъзхождащи обикновените сетивни възприятия? 

Отговор: На първо място, обучените ясновидци не преследват лични цели, те не се интересуват и в най-малка степен дали хората вярват или не; въпреки че за хората е много важно дали да вярват или не. За тренирания ясновидец това няма никакво значение. Той никога не се стреми към пари или някакво друго признание което светът може да му предложи ако бъде убеден, той няма желание за светска власт, той никога не парадира със своите качества или пък да се хвали и гордее с тях, а винаги говори за тях с възможно най-голямата сдържаност и мярка, когато изобщо го прави. Ако той върши нещо похвално, може би когато помага на ближните си, на него му е все едно дали тези факти ще станат известни. Той обикновено не позволява на ‘’лявата си ръка да знае какво прави дясната’’. 

Слепите хора не виждат цветовете и светлината, въпреки че те са навсякъде около тях и ако слепият човек помоли да се подложим на експерименти които биха му доказали без съмнение че ние виждаме светлина и цвят, ние бихме чудили какви опити биха го убедили в тяхното съществуване. Така и обученият ясновидец се чуди какви опити биха убедили всеки. Все още няма измислен тест който не би оставил свободно пространство за някакво друго обяснение в ума на някои хора и нещастният ясновидец който би се подложил на такива опити ще бъде принуден да ги продължава и продължава до безкрай и въпреки това поколения от скептици биха го обявили за измамник. Би се наложило да се подлага на опити провеждани от всеки един учен, пък учените не винаги вярват на собствените си очи. Ако тяхното разсъждение им подсказва, че това нещо е невъзможно, те отказват да повярват, въпреки демонстрираното. Хората на науката са принудени да се задоволяват експериментирайки в рамките на природните закони, когато например те провеждат изследванията си в областта на химията или на някоя друга наука, в областта на която те имат познания. Но те си позволяват правото да предписват условията за тестване на свръх-физическа материя за която те не знаят нищо. Когато медиуми изискват тъмна стая за своите експерименти, учените обикновено казват: 

‘’О, да, това веднага показва че те са мошеници, те искат тъмна стая за да могат да правят триковете си на тъмно без да се вижда какво правят и да не бъдат разкрити’’. Медиумите, обикновено, не знаят защо помещението трябва да бъде затъмнено и затова не могат да обяснят, но има изискване, което е в основата на желанието на медиума. 

То е следното: Светлината привежда етера в свободно вибриране и затруднява комуникиращите същества да работят с него при тези условия, да го оформят в тяло, гласов орган, ръка или някакво друго материално проявление. Колкото е по- тъмна стаята, полкова по-слабо вибрира етерът и толкова е по-лесно за тези същества да го използват както е нужно за спиритуалистическите феномени. 

Има ред други закони касаещи свръхфизическите феномени за които учените нямат концепции и това незнание веднага ги дисквалифицира за формулиране на условията. З тях обаче, пътят винаги е отворен за получаване на знания от първа ръка. Те ни казват, вземете определен брой лещи, съединете ги по определен начин, поставете ги по определен начин в тръба, насочете тази тръба с вашите лещи в определена посока към небето и вие ще видите осемте луни обикалящи около Сатурн. Ако следваме указанията им ние ще видим това което те казват че се намира там. Ако откажем да използваме необходимия инструмент ние не може да видим спътниците на Сатурн. Ние им казваме: водете такъв начин на живот и се упражнявайте, така че да можете да развиете в себе си това качество за което става въпрос. Тогава вие ще се убедите че сме казвали истината и тогава вие ще бъдете принудени да твърдите това което твърдим ние. Ако те не се съгласяват да изпълнят нашите указания, те ще останат така неубедени за съществуването на свръхфизическите области, както хората които не искат да се сдобият с телескоп може да се съмняват в съществуването на спътниците на Сатурн, това е пределно ясно за тренираните ясновидци. 

### <h3 id="question-133">ВЪПРОС No.133</h3>

Ако ясновидството представлява точно познание с висока стойност и е висше духовно качество, защо толкова често може да се срещне като притежание на хора с ниско образование и потекло; които очевидно притежават много малко духовност и които често лъжат? 

Отговор: Имало е време в много далечното минало когато човешкото тяло е било не така сложно устроен организъм както е сега, преди да бъде развита гръбначно- мозъчната система която да предостави на човек волеви контрол над неговото тяло. По това време симпатичната или неволевата нервна система се е грижила за чисто животинските функции, много подобно на това което прави днес. Тогава човек е бил в много по-голяма степен духовно същество, отколкото е сега, и неговите средства за възприемане на Духовния Свят са били органи, които сега временно не се използват. Ние имаме в нашето тяло определен брой органи на различно ниво на завършено развитие, някои от които са атрофирали защото са изразходвали своята функция. Мускулите които движат ушите при животните, например, съществуват и при човека, но те не са вече необходими и затова повечето от нас са загубили способността да ги използват. Други органи са на етап на развитие, както например сърцето, което е един неволеви мускул, но е снабден с напречно набраздени мускулни влакна като волевите мускули и в бъдеще ще бъде възможно да се регулира желаната скорост на съкращаване. 

Друга група от органи са в латентно състояние и сред тях са част от хипофизата и пинеалната жлеза. Ако нямаше да се използват в бъдеще, те сигурно биха атрофирали както всички други органи които са преустановили функционирането и няма повече да бъдат използвани. В далечното минало тези органи били свързани със симпатичната нервна система и са осигурявали на човек неволно ясновидство. Благодарение на връзката им с гръбначно-мозъчната система, в бъдеще те ще осигуряват волевия контакт по желание на човек с Духовните Светове. 

По-лесно е да се търкаля един камък по нанадолнището отколкото да се избута до върха; регресът се осъществява по-лесно отколкото прогреса и когато хората желаят развитие в отрицателен смисъл те лесно подновяват отрицателното или пасивното функциониране на хипофизата и на пинеалната жлеза и стават отрицателни или пасивни ясновидци. Но както всяко действие което се практикува посредством неволевата нервна система не може да бъде използвано по желание със силата на волята, това действие е, разбира се, спорадично при медиумите. Понякога, когато силата е на лице, могат да контактуват с Духовните Светове в ограничена степен. Друг път, когато силата е изключена, те не са в състояние да виждат. Затова те често симулират за да получат необходимото възнаграждение. 

Човек който съзнателно развива своите духовни способности контролира вибрациите на двата малки органа посредством силата на волята и той няма ‘’почивни дни’’. Той притежава способността да вижда винаги и по всяко време. Затова в неговите ръце ясновидството е точно познание, но трябва да се разбере, че както тук е необходимо да се правят проучвания преди да се придобият знания, същото е и в онзи свят. Много хора са глупаво скептично настроени спрямо преживяванията и усещанията в свръх-физическите светове, но хората които мислят, че ако човек ‘’вижда’’ в невидимите светове той веднага узнава всичко за тях, са по същия начин глупави. Един сляп човек, който е придобил способността да вижда посредством операция, може да послужи като илюстрация на факта, че ние трябва да се учим да виждаме тук във Физическия Свят, защото отначало той много често затваря очите си, казвайки че е по-лесно да се предвижва по усет отколкото посредством зрение, защото той още не се е научил да определя разстоянието до заобикалящите го обекти. Бебето, което се мъчи да хване луната или нещо друго което се намира на другия край на стаята, също демонстрира този факт. Каквото е горе, такова е и долу, преди човек да бъде обучен само наличието на ясновидство не му помага много и идеята, че защото той вижда задължително знае всичко е безсмислена. Ние, които сме наблюдавали всичко през целия си живот тук, не знаем всичко за този свят; също така и хората които ‘’виждат’’ не знаят всичко за другия свят. Освен това, формите тук са стабилни и не се променят лесно, докато наблюдението и познанието във Вътрешните Светове са усложнени поради пластичността на формите там, защото те често се променят за секунда в отговор на мислите на съществата които действат там. 

Да се развие волево ясновидство е трудна задача и затова тази способност притежават малцина, докато отрицателното или пасивното ясновидство, за съжаление е развито от много хора, които нямат високи идеали за да попречат на злоупотребата с техните способности за пари. 

### <h3 id="question-134">ВЪПРОС No.134</h3>

Какво разбирате под посвещаване и защо посветените са само мъже? 

Отговор: Обикновено под посвещаване се разбира достъп до секретен орден, обикновено след заплащане на такса, но окултното посвещаване е нещо много по-различно. 

Когато един човек е полагал усилия да води по-възвишен духовен начин на живот за известно време, пречистил е своите носители е своите тела-носители чрез умствени, морални и физически усилия, той излъчва светлина в невидимия свят и акумулира сила в себе си. След време се достига кулминационна точка когато тази сила трябва да получи изход навън. Тогава в неговия живот се появява един духовен учител който му показва силата която е култивирал, често несъзнателно, и как да я използва. Тази демонстрация се нарича посвещаване. То може да се проведе в храм или не; то може или не да бъде придружено с церемония, както условията диктуват. Нека да бъде ясно разбрано, че никаква церемония не може да даде на кандидата силите които посвещаването го учи да използва, както натискането на спусъка на незареден пистолет не може да произведе изстрел. Церемонията на посвещаването би била безсмислена ако не е кулминация на един живот на ученик на окултизма. 

Затова, очевидно е, че посвещаването е неизбежен резултат на заслужени достойнства. То никога не се продава за пари, въпреки че не липсват безскрупулни шарлатани които предлагат на всекиго да го посветят в окултно изкуство за което те самите не знаят нищо; нито пък са желани. Лековерни или неискрени хора които се надяват да придобият зловеща власт над своите събратя чрез култивирането й приемат предложението им. Ако Симон вълшебника е заслужил язвителното порицание на Петър когато се е опитал да купи спиритическа сила срещу злато, ние се чудим какво порицание заслужават тези които се обявяват за комерсиална стока, особено когато те всъщност не са в състояние да осигурят стоката която са обявили за продан. Задаващият въпроса е в заблуждение като смята, че Посветените са само мъже, поне що се отнася до Lesser Mysteries*. Има жени Посветени и понякога дори Посветени от Великите Мистерии взимат женско тяло за изпълнението на специална задача. Вярно е обаче, че тези които са напреднали толкова много, че имат избор по отношение на пола, обикновено предпочитат мъжко тяло и причината не е трудно да се разбере. Жената има положително витално тяло, но отрицателно плътно тяло и по този начин е някак си ощетена в света, както е устроен понастоящем. Стремейки се към високите идеали и водейки възвишен начин на живот ние одухотворяваме виталното тяло и го трансформираме (трансмутираме) в душа, която е винаги положителна – една сила ползваема независимо от пола – и когато Посветеният носи едно мъжко тяло също така, той е изцяло положителен във Физическия Свят и има по-добър шанс за напредък, отколкото когато използва женски носител.

### <h3 id="question-135">ВЪПРОС No.135</h3>

Не е ли задължение на някой, който е информира за същността на духовно извисения начин на живот, да даде информация и помощ на по-малко запознатите? 

Отговор: Положително, знанието е нещо което можем да дадем на другите и все пак да си останем непроменени. Фактически, когато разпространяваме нашите знания, ние помагаме на себе си и увеличаваме нашия собствен запас. Защото никой не знае нещо преди да е разказал за него и да го е обяснил на някой друг и трябва да разберем, че каквото и знание да придобием, то не е изключително само наша собственост, а трябва да се използва за всеобщо добро. Ако ние егоистично го трупаме и отказваме да осветлим другите, то ще действа против нас по същия начин както ако непрекъснато поемаме физическа храна без да се освобождаваме от отпадъците. Ще дойде време когато няма да можем повече да издържим и ще се разболеем. Така е и с хората които придобиват знания относно по-високо духовния начин на живот. Ако те ги задържат в себе си вместо да ги използват за благото на другите, много е възможно те да останат самотни или да се разстроят психически. 

### <h3 id="question-136">ВЪПРОС No.136</h3>

Каква квалификация е необходима за да стане човек Невидим Помощник? Целия живот ли трябва да отдаде в стремежа си към духовност? 

Отговор: Не, съвсем не: всъщност, никой не е оправдан за това че отдава целия си живот на духовния напредък, ако не е изпълнил всичките си задължения от материалния живот към другите. Задълженията в семейството означават да бъдем видими помощници на мъжът или жената. Които бягат от задълженията си тук, със сигурност на тях не може да се разчита, че ще изпълнят задълженията си на Невидими Помощници в отвъдното. 

Затова, търпеливото продължаване на изпълняването на всичките ни земни задължения, влагайки най-доброто на което сме способни, е първото и най-важно качество на стремящия се. Като следващо качество можем да споменем самоконтрола. Докато живеем и работим в нашите плътни тела, тялото на желанията се държи относително под контрол в затвора на плътната физическа материя. Ако загубим самообладание тук, резултатът може да бъде опасен за самите нас и за тези които са около нас, но това е несравнимо с голямата опасност съпровождаща изгубването на самообладание в отвъдния свят, защото нашето тяло на желанията, както ни е известно, може да повреди физическото ни тяло така, че то понякога може да боледува в продължение на седмици като резултат от няколко минутно изпускане на нервите. Но когато е извън плътното тяло и ако силата му се насочи към някой друг, то може светкавично да унищожи цяла армия. 

Знания също се изискват от един стремящ се. Докато не сме се запознали детайлно със състоянията след смъртта и със схемата на еволюцията, докато не сме си създали изчерпателна представа за устройството на човека и докато не сме се запознали с другите подобни на изброените въпроси, за нас няма да е възможно да даваме информация на тези които са по-малко информирани и да поемем задачите на един Невидим Помощник, това би било същото както да изпратим един неграмотен за учител в училище. 

Последно, но не най-маловажно, Невидимият Помощник трябва да бъде изпълнен с всеобхватна любов към хората. Не може да бъдем безчувствени към страданията на нашите събратя тук и в същото време в другия свят да сме изпълнени с любов и желание да им помагаме, както човек който не познава дори и една нота през земния си живот не може да стане перфектен музикант само от простия факт че е умрял или да придобие такава страст към музиката, че да иска да прекара цяла вечност свирейки на хорн или арфа. Затова повтаряме отново, за да станем Невидими Помощници там, първо трябва да се квалифицираме помагайки тук. 

### <h3 id="question-137">ВЪПРОС No.137</h3>

С каква цел човек излиза от тялото си? 

Отговор: На сегашното ниво от нашата еволюция голямата част от човечеството е привързана към своето тяло по през земния живот.Хората са поставени в малко и тясно пространство защото там могат да бъдат научени определени уроци, което може да се осъществи най-добре чрез изключване практически на всички други пространства и обкръжаващи условия от полезрението. Но идва време, когато човек е израснал достатъчно в познанията си за да е желателно да има по- широка сфера на действие. Тогава тялото става пречка и е целесъобразно да бъде напускано от време навреме. И той бива обучаван по подходящ начин от Старшите Братя да се освобождава по желание посредством волята си. Те от своя страна са били подпомагани в миналото от по-напреднали същества от други планети докато са станали способни да обучават сега други хора които са по- назад в еволюцията си от тях. 

Смисълът на излизане от тялото е да се придобият по-широки познания. Но това знание има смисъл само за това, да се помага на другите да напредват. Затова, тези които са способни да напускат телата си са известни като Невидимите Помощници. Тяхно задължение е да помагат и на живите и на мъртвите според възможностите си.

Абсолютно задължително ли е да се води живот на аскет за да стане човек духовна личност и да бъде надарен със спиритически сили? 

Отговор: Зависи какво задаващият въпроса има пред вид аскетизъм. Някои хора от Изтока се вмъкват в бъчви снабдени отвътре с остри шипове и се търкалят в тях с цел да умъртвят плътта или се бичуват и нараняват по различни начини за да придобият спиритически сили. Това със сигурност не е правилно. Те може след време да станат ясновидци и те стават, но този начин е така достоен за порицание и неговите резултати са така нетрайни, както е ефекта получен чрез взиране в кристална сфера, чрез пристрастяване към наркотици и други подобни методи. 

Трябва да разберем и осъзнаем, че това физическо тяло е нашия най-ценен инструмент и че наше задължение е да му предоставим отговорно цялата необходима грижа за да бъде здраво и да се чувства добре осигурявайки нужните условия за това. Никаква сила която се придобива посредством малтретиране на тялото ни може да бъде висша сила и затова или не се задържа за дълго или не е напълно ефикасна. 

Но някои хора под аскетизъм разбират ‘’да се води нравствен и целомъдрен начин на живот’’. Някои биха желали спиритическа сила без да жертват животинските си наклонности; те се искат да могат да литнат в небесата когато пожелаят и след това да могат да се въргалят в калта. Те искат да продължат да ядат лоша храна, да се тъпчат с месо, алкохол и тютюн, да се отдават на страстите си и на чувствените си желания по всякакъв начин и едновременно с това те искат да имат духовни спиритически сили. 

Това не може да стане. Нашите тела са нашите инструменти. А добрият майстор цени добрите инструменти и ги поддържа в най-доброто възможно състояние – остри и чисти. Когато сетивата ни са били притъпени от алкохол и цигари, когато организмът е бил принуден да изразходва цялата си енергия за храносмилане или за отделяне на отпадъците от лошата храна, може ли да се очаква че този човек ще бъде чувствителен и силно усещащ и съзнаващ? Не може да служим на Бог и на ниските желания. Изборът е наш. Ако искаме да имаме духовни сили трябва да платим цената на чистия живот, трябва да даваме на нашите тела чиста храна и да ги подчиним на правилата на прост и умерен начин на живот, трябва да се откажем от всичко което може да притъпи сетивата ни – алкохол, никотин и други подобни злоупотреби. Ако това се нарича ‘’аскетичен живот, тогава аскетизмът е абсолютно задължителен. 

### <h3 id="question-139">ВЪПРОС No.139</h3>

Всички ли деца, до навършването на определена възраст, са ясновидци? 

Отговор: Да, всички притежават ясновидство поне през първата година от живота си. До голяма степен зависи от духовното ниво на детето, също така от неговото обкръжение, за това колко дълго ще запази то тази способност, защото повечето деца споделят със своите родители и с възрастните които се грижат за тях всичко което виждат и способността им за ясновидство се повлиява от тяхното отношение. Често на децата се присмиват и нищо не може да нарани така техните чувствителни малки души. Скоро те се научават да изключват възприятията си които предизвикват присмеха на техните родители и детегледачи или се научават поне да задържат в себе си тези преживявания. Ако ги послушаме, те често разкриват пред нас чудни неща и понякога е възможно да се проследи предишния живот посредством информацията получена от малкото дете. Това може да стане, разбира се, ако детето е умряло когато е било дете в предишния си живот защото тогава то е пребивавало само за период от една до двадесет години в Невидимия Свят, така че е възможно да се провери неговата информация. Децата, които в предишния си живот умират като деца, имат много по-голяма способност да помнят миналото и да притежават ясновидство отколкото другите, защото виталното тяло и тялото на желанията не се раждат по време на физическото раждане на детето, а когато то е навърши седем и четиринадесет години, съответно, а това което не се е родило не може да умре, така че ако детето умре преди раждането на виталното тяло или на тялото на желанията, то няма да отиде на Второто и Трето Небе, а ще остане в Света на Желанията и ще бъде родено отново със същото тяло на желанията и ум които е притежавало в предишния си живот и затова ще може много повече да помни какво се е случило тогава. Авторът попадна на един такъв случай преди няколко години в Южна Калифорния. 

Един ден в Санта Барбара, един мъж на име Робертс си вървял по улицата когато едно детенце изтичало към него, обгърнало с ръце коленето му и му казало ‘’татко’’. Господин Робертс си помислил, че някой иска да му натрапи това дете и възмутено се отскубнал. Майката на детето също се смутила от действието му и го дръпнала настрани. Но детето продължавало да вика: ‘’Това е моя татко, това е моя татко’’. Поради обстоятелствата които ще станат ясни по-късно, случилото се не давало спокойствие на мислите на господин Робертс и той посетил един човек когото ще наречем ‘’Ь’’. Заедно те отишли в дома на детенцето където то живеело заедно със своите родители и след известни преговори им е било позволено да разпитат дъщеря им. Още щом момиченцето зърнало господин Робертс, то изтичало отново към него и му казало ‘’татко’’. След това, като резултат от разговор с прекъсвания през целия следобед, детето разказало следната история, която излагаме тук в свързана последователност. 

Едно време тя живеела с господин Робертс като неин баща и с друга майка в малка къща край един поток където цъфтели цветя (тук тя изтичала навън и донесла няколко върбови клонки). Там имало дъсчено мостче над потока по което й било забранено да преминава за да не падне във водата. Един ден господин Робертс напуснал майка й и нея за да не се върне никога вече. ‘’Тя стана неподвижна и умря’’, каза след това детето. ‘’Аз също умрях, но аз не умрях, аз дойдох тук!’’. 

След това господин Робертс разказал своята история. ‘’Преди около осемнадесет години той живеел със своя баща, пивовар, в Англия. Той се влюбил в тяхната прислужница, но бащата отказал да даде разрешение за женитба. Младите избягали от Лондон, оженили се, отишли в Австралия, където той разчистил малко пространство в гората за ферма и построил къща до поток където растели върби. Имало дървено мостче над потока. Родило им се детенце и когато то станало на около две години, господин Робертс един ден отишъл до едно сечище което се намирало на около една миля от хижата и там един служител на реда се приближил към него с пистолет и го арестувал заради банков обир извършен в същата вечер когато той напуснал Лондон. 

Той настоявал че е невинен, умолявал да го пуснат при своята съпруга и детето си за да се погрижи за тях, но полицаят се страхувал от капан който ще му попречи да го предаде в ръцете на властите и под заплаха на оръжието отвел господин Робертс до крайбрежието. След това, той е бил отведен в Англия, съден за обира и е бил обявен за невинен. До тогава властите не обръщали внимание на неговите непрестанни молби да се погрижат за жена му и детето му, които сигурно вече са умрели от глад в дивата провинция на Австралия. Била изпратена телеграма, организирано издирване и след време отговорът се появил. Открити били останките на любимите и господин Робертс заминал за Америка, един човек с разбито сърце.’’ 

След това на детето внимателно били показани снимки, измежду тях имало две снимки на господин Робертс и неговата съпруга. Външният вид на господин Робертс се бил променил много откакто са били направени снимките. Въпреки това, когато детето стигнало до тези снимки, тя радостно извикала: ‘’О, ето го татко!’’. Тя също разпознала на снимката своята майка, в предишния живот. Малкото дете е било само на около три години когато се срещнали с господин Робертс и не е възможно да си е измислило такава история. По-късно този случай е бил разследван от един от най-популярните вестници в Южна Калифорния, Лос Анжелис Таймс, и откритите факти са идентични с изложените тук. 

### <h3 id="question-140">ВЪПРОС No.140</h3>

Каква е разликата между бяла и черна магия и какъв ефект има практикуването на черна магия върху душата? 

Отговор: Магия е процесът при който можем да постигнем определени резултати които изглеждат невъзможни от гледна точка на познатите обикновени закони. Някои хора са опознали закони на природата които са неизвестни за повечето хора и са станали адепти служейки си с духовните сили. Те използват тази сила за да помагат на ближните си, когато това може да се осъществи в хармония със законите на тяхното израстване. Други, изучавали законите и придобили възможността да си служат със същите сили на вселената, използват своите способности за егоистични цели, за да придобият власт над ближните си. Първата спомената група е групата на Белите Магове, втората е групата на Черните. Двете групи използват и си служат с едни и същи сили, разликата е в мотивите които ги подтикват. Мотивите на Белия Маг са само любов и милост. Въпреки че мислите за отплата не са му присъщи, един чудесен душевен растеж се получава като резултат от използването на магическата сила. Той не очаква печалба от прилагането на таланта си, но получава такава в хилядократен размер. Черният Маг, от друга страна, е в окаяно положение защото казано е: ‘’душа която греши ще умре’’, и всичко което прави в противовес на законите на Бог, ще има за резултат неизбежно влошаване на качествата на душата. 

Черният Маг посредством знанията и способностите си може понякога да запази постигнатото еволюционно ниво в продължение на няколко животи, но след това настъпва момент когато душата се разрушава и Его се връща в това което може да наречем дивак. 

Черната магия в миньорния си вид, като хипнозата например, понякога причинява вродено слабоумие през бъдещ живот. Хипнотизаторът лишава своите жертви от свободното използване на техните тела. Под ударите на закона за причинно- следствената връзка, той след това е окован към тяло с увреден мозък, който препятства нормалното му изявяване. Не трябва да правим извод, обаче, че всеки случай на вродено слабоумие е следствие на такава злоупотреба на Его през миналия живот; има и други причини които могат да доведат но вродено слабоумие.

Вие говорите за западни и източни школи на окултизъм. Не е ли западната школа по-добра, и ако е така, защо? 

Отговор: Сега на земята съществуват няколко различни раси. Индийската е първата раса от настоящата Арианска Епоха, а Англосаксонската е петата. Естествено най-новото учение е дадено на най-напредналите хора. Затова западната религия, Християнството, в голяма степен превъзхожда Хиндуизма и Будизма на Изтока. Тайните учения на Изтока също не са на нивото на тези от запада. В страните на Изтока голямо ударение се поставя върху състоянието на тялото за да може то да култивира спиритически способности. Те поставят тялото в определени позиции като едновременно с това извършват трудни дихателни и други физически упражнения, които не са необходими според западния метод. Всъщност, западното тяло съвсем не е податливо на тези въздействия. Освен това, ученикът на Изтока е под абсолютния контрол на своя духовен учител когото той нарича ‘’Господар’’, и чиито заповеди той трябва да изпълнява до-най малкия детайл без да пита защо. Н запад, ние следваме учението на Христос, който е казал на своите ученици: ‘’Не ви наричам вече слуги, защото слугата не знае що върши господарят му; а ви нарекох приятели, защото ви казах всичко, що съм чул от Отца си.’’ (Йоан, 15:15). Затова духовният учител в Западния Свят е в най- близки приятелски отношения със своя ученик и винаги е готов да отговаря на неговите въпроси доколкото е в състояние в зависимост от нивото на развитието си. 

Разбира се, в Източния Свят има известен брой много напреднали хора, които са достигнали високо ниво в ученията на тяхната школа, но това ниво обикновено се постига посредством западните методи за по-кратко време и с по-малко усилия. 

### <h3 id="question-142">ВЪПРОС No.142</h3>

Каква е разликата между етерното зрение, ясновидството и зрението принадлежащо на Света на Мисълта? 

Отговор: Ако наблюдаваме човек чрез етерно зрение, ние първо виждаме неговото облекло отвън, след това подплатата отвътре, неговото бельо, неговата кожа, ребрата и различните органи на тялото му по посока на наблюдението, след това гръбначните прешлени, мускулите, кожата и дрехите му от вътрешната страна. С други думи, ние виждаме през него. Посредством етерното зрение човек може да вижда през книги, хартия, писма, стени или праз всякакъв обект на близко разстояние. Фактически, тази способност може да бъде наречена зрение от рентгенови лъчи. Само една субстанция е непроницаема за неговата всепроникваща способност. Стъклото е непрозрачно за етерното зрение както е каменната стена за обикновеното физическо зрение поради същата причина, може би, че стъклото е много добър изолатор на електричеството. 

Когато наблюдаваме човек или предмет чрез обикновено ясновидско зрение, ние виждаме неговото тяло на желанията и съставните части на другите му тела отвътре и отвън – всяка частица едновременно и по едно и също време. Трудно е да се чете книга или дори писмо с етерно зрение защото трябва да четем през други страници което замъглява тази която искаме да прочетем. Когато използваме обикновено ясновидство, изглежда като че ли книгата се е разпростряла така че можем да четем всяка страница или всяка част без да е нужно да гледаме през друга част. Но когато наблюдаваме даден обект със зрението присъщо на четирите по-долни области на Света на Мисълта, а авторът няма собствени познания за по-горните области, ние откриваме че вместо форми там има кухи празни пространства или матрици, които ни говорят разказвайки за себе си. Необходимостта от изследване и проучване не е нужна в този свят. Там узнаваме изведнъж всичко за обекта на нашето внимание. Има, обаче, една любопитна подробност във връзка със знанието придобито по този начин – то се появява в нас цялото изведнъж. Сумата от това знание е цялото и няма нито начало нито край. Поради това, обикновено е херкулесовски трудно да се разкрие в една подредена последователна концепция която да бъде изложена разбираемо за нас самите и за другите. 

### <h3 id="question-143">ВЪПРОС No.143</h3>

Безопасно ли е за човек със силно отслабена нервна система да се занимава с окултните упражнения дадени от Розенкройцерите или е необходимо този човек първо да оздравее? Може ли здравето да се възстанови посредством окултна тренировка? 

Отговор: Духовните тренировъчни упражнения направени публично достояние от Розенкройцерите са само две: сутрешното и вечерното. Вечерното упражнение представлява ретроспекция на събитията от деня в обратен ред. По време на този преглед стремящият се старае да култивира чувство на възможно най- искрено разкаяние за всичко което може да е сторил погрешно или не на място и също така да чувства интензивна радост ако е успял да коригира и поправи предишното си поведение във всяко действие през изминалия ден. Сутрешното упражнение представлява концентриране върху висок идеал, Христос, например. 

Ако човек с нервен темперамент се постарае тихо и спокойно да изпълнява тези упражнения ще почувства много благотворен ефект, особено ако се стреми да отпусне всеки мускул от тялото по време на упражненията. 

Поведението на една котка дебнеща пред дупката на мишка предлага отлична илюстрация на релаксацията. Тя застава в перфектна поза; тихо и спокойно очаква появяването на мишката. Никаква енергия не се изразходва в раздразнително нетърпение. Тя спокойно поддържа увереността си, че рано или късно добрата възможност ще се появи. Цялата й енергия е запазена за субливния момент когато ще скочи за да грабне плячката. Ако ученикът напълно отпусне мускулите си, тихо и спокойно прегледа случките от деня през вечерното упражнение и се концентрира върху един възвишен идеал през сутрешното упражнение, нервността постепенно ще изчезне и един ден благоприятната възможност ще се появи; духовното зрение ще се разгърне. 

### <h3 id="question-144">ВЪПРОС No.144</h3>

Щом здрав организъм е необходим за духовно развитие, какво е становището в учението на Розенкройцерите за човек който в настоящия момент не е в най- добра физическа кондиция? Дали перфектно здраве ще бъде един от резултатите от изучаването на тази философия и ако учението се практикува, дали това ще позволи на човек да се съхрани в добро здравословно състояние? 

Отговор: Задаващият въпроса започва с погрешна концепция, а именно, че здрав организъм е необходим за истинско духовно развитие и вероятно, също така, забравя разликата между ‘’здрав’’ и ‘’чувствителен’’. Много хора назад в развитието си притежават най-здравите физически тела, но съвсем не са чувствителни по отношение на духовните вибрации. Една илюстрация ще изясни това: Авторът е имал един будилник, евтин часовник, в продължение на много години. Понякога е бил слаган в куфар и пренасян от носачи по-най невнимателен начин и след това когато е бил изваждан от куфара след цялото тръскане и след като са се били отнасяли така зле с него, той все още върви и продължава да показва времето някак си, ако нямате нищо против грешка в плюс или минус от няколко минути. Такъв часовник е здрав, но не е точен. 

От друга страна, един хронометър който се използва на борда на кораб, е един изключително деликатен часовник. Той са поставя върху балансиращи пружини които го поддържат постоянно в хоризонтално положение компенсирайки и най- слабото движение на кораба, така че хронометърът да може да поддържа перфектно точното време защото хиляди животи понякога зависят от екстремната точност на този уред. Капитанът, който води кораба в необятния океан знае на какво разстояние източно или западно се намира от Гринуич в Англия, посредством този точен часовник – Хронометъра. Когато той изчисли разликата между 12 часа на обяд на мястото където се намира и времето показвано от хронометъра той получава точната локация на кораба, локация на която той разчита и доверява живота на всичките си пътници и милиони долари, цената на имуществото поверено на неговата грижа. Сравнението между чувствителния хронометър и грубия будилник илюстрира разликата между ‘’чувствителен’’ и ‘’здрав’’. 

Когато разбираме висшите философски учения, когато водим начин на живот на който те ни учат, нашето тяло става в най-голяма степен чувствително и за него трябва да се полагат повече грижи отколкото са нужни за тялото на един индианец или негър от джунглите на Африка. Те нямат така фино устроена нервна система както бялата раса. Тези които се интересуват от духовното развитие са особено чувствителни, затова когато напредваме става необходимо да се грижим все повече и повече за този инструмент. Но също така учим законите на неговата природа и как да се приспособяваме към тях. Ако прилагаме знанията си на практика за нас става възможно притежаването на такъв чувствителен инструмент и поддържането му в добро здравословно състояние. 

Има случаи, обаче, когато е нужно заболяване което да предизвика определени изменения в организма които са предвестник на стъпка на по-високо стъпало в духовното извисяване, а в този случай, разбира се, болестта е благословение а не проклятие. В общия случай обаче, може да се каже че изучаването на висшите философски учения винаги ще допринася за подобряване на здравето, защото ‘’знанието е сила’’ и колкото повече знаем толкова по-добре се справяме с всички обстоятелства при всички условия, ако разбира се прилагаме нашите знания на практика и живеем както трябва – ако не сме просто слушатели а също и изпълнители, защото никое учение няма да е от полза за нас ако не се включи в живота ни и не се живее ден след ден. 

### <h3 id="question-145">ВЪПРОС No.145</h3>

По какъв начин ще ни помогне в живота след смъртта, ако сме култивирали ясновидство в настоящия живот? 

Отговор: По много начини.На първо място, много хора имат голям страх от смъртта; само споменаването на думата смърт предизвиква полазване на тръпки по гърба им и те винаги се стремят да избягват тази тема. Страхът от смъртта генерира мисъл-форми от ужасен вид и когато човек напусне тялото си при смъртта за да встъпи в Невидимия Свят той вижда тези ужасни форми заобикалящи го като множество демони и понякога те могат да го накарат да загуби разсъдъка си. Те са обаче негови рожби и той не може да се освободи от тях докато не се научи, че те нямат власт над него и докато безстрашно не им заповяда да изчезнат. Тогава те се стопяват като сняг огрян от слънцето. 

Човек, който е култивирал ясновидство през земния си живот, също бива измъчван ор различни елементални създания при първото си встъпване в Невидимия Свят, които приемат също така ужасяващи форми. Те разпознават в ново посветения своя бъдещ господар и се стремят да го отклонят от намеренията му сплашвайки го, но понеже той обикновено е подпомаган и подкрепян от духовен учител и му е казано, че тези създания нямат власт над него, той много бързо преодолява страха. Когато по-късно той напуска тялото си при смъртта и встъпва в Невидимия Свят, той вече е запознат до голяма степен с това което може да види там и не се страхува да го преодолее. 

### <h3 id="question-146">ВЪПРОС No.146</h3>

Съзерцанието на Бог вътре в нас, ако се прави системно и упорито, би ли помогнало на някого в духовното му израстване и в израстването му до Адепт? 

Отговор: В настоящето, ние живеем във всекидневно трудещия се Западен Свят*, където всеки трябва да върши своята работа. Всеки от нас има работа за вършене и ако бягаме от нея за да се вглеждаме да болка в себе си, ние не само няма да израстваме, а ще дегенерираме духовно. 

() - Западен Свят* - Страните в които Християнството е официална религия.

Някои хора, за съжаление, се чувстват оправдани да изоставят земните си задължения когато си въобразят, че духовният напредък ги зове, но докато не сме изпълнили всяко задължение тук не може да има истински духовен напредък; всичко което ни изглежда като такова накрая ще се превърне във вятър и мъгла. 

Страните от Далечния Изток илюстрират като лош пример ужасните резултати които се получават в следствие на занемаряването на материалните задължения в интерес на това което те си представят че е духовна мощ. Там някои хора изтощават и деформират тялото си посредством такива практики като държане на едната ръка над главата докато изсъхне. Това не е истинска спиритуалност и не допринася за доброто на света. Казано е от едно време, че ‘’всеки тежи на мястото си’’. Но вярно е също, че това което не е предназначено да извиси всички, никога няма да повдигне индивидуално никого. Най-дълбокото и идващо от сърцето желание да се прави просто добро, е единствената валидна проява при полагането на усилията които са присъщи на култивирането на духовна сила. Известни са случаи когато майки са присъствали на сбирки на които се е дискутирало как по- добре да се грижат за дома и децата, докато междувременно са оставяли децата си сами без надзор и грижа в къщи. Тези случаи не са преувеличени или шега, те съдържат повече истина отколкото фантазия. И хората които дърдорят за духовност, които желаят да съзерцават ангела в себе си и занемаряват семейството си и другите си насъщни задължения са също като тези майки. Колкото по-скоро се събудим за реалността на факта, че никое сегашно задължение, колкото и да е скромно, не може да бъда занемарено безнаказано заради заниманията за духовния напредък колкото и да е превъзнасян, толкова по-добре ще бъде за нас и за всички около нас. Бихме посъветвали задаващия въпроса да прочете стихотворението на Longfellow ‘’Красива легенда’’. Много е подходящо за случая: Един монах е коленичил на каменния под когато му се явява красиво видение на Христос точно когато обедният камбанен звън го призовава към портата, където бедните очакват милостиня. Негово задължение е да им я дава всеки ден. Тогава в главата на монаха изниква въпроса, дали да остане при Благословения Пришълец или да го изостави заради раздаването на гладните просяци? Но един глас вътре в него му казва: 

```
‘’Изпълни дълга си, това е най-доброто,   
Останалото остави на Господа.’’   
```

Той последвал повелята на този глас изоставяйки Видението в килията си и чудейки се дали ще бъде още там когато се върне. Той е чувствал, че е правилно да изпълни дълга си към другите независимо от това, че ще причини загуба на себе си и когато, след като е раздал милостинята на бедните се връща в килията си, Видението го поздравило с думите: ‘’Ако ти беше останал Аз щях да си отида’’.

Н е ли документирано, че някои хора са развили спиритически способности, ясновидство, шесто чувство или както и да желаем да го наречем чрез нравствен живот в хармония с всемирните закони и не се ли получава така, че ученията на съвременния окултизъм, които съдържат толкова много сложна терминология, притежават тенденцията да предизвикват объркване вместо да довеждат до желания резултат? 

Отговор: Пътят на развитие във всеки случай зависи от темперамента и характера на стремящия се. Има два пътя, мистичния и интелектуалния. Мистичният обикновено е лишен от интелектуално знание; човекът следва това което диктува сърцето му и се стреми към Бога както той го чувства, повдигайки се нагоре без да съзнава някаква определена цел и накрая придобива познанието. През средните векове хората не са имали това интелектуално ниво на развитие каквото ние имаме сега и тези които са чувствали зова за възвисен живот обикновено са следвали мистичния път. Но през последните няколко стотин години, след появата на съвременната наука много повече хора със високо развит интелект населяват земята;главата напълно господства над сърцето, материализмът доминира над всички духовни импулси и мнозинството от мислещите хора не вярва на нищо което не може да види или да докосне. Затова трябва да се включи техния интелект за да може да се позволи на сърцето да повярва това което интелектът е одобрил. Като отговор на тази необходимост съвременните школи на окултизъм се стремят да направят връзка между научни факти и спиритуални истини. Материалистическата ориентация на ума е, разбира се, особено възприета в Западния Свят и Орденът на Розенкройцерите беше основан през 13тия век за да подготви антидот срещу отровата на материализма който може да бъде даван при неотложна нужда, както в този случай. Paracelsus, Comenius, Helmond, Bacon и други са предоставяли в по-завоалирана форма учението което сега ясно се провъзгласява за да демонстрира, че науката, изкуството и религията са тройно единство което не може да се разедини без да пострада нашия възглед за света. 

Истинската религия обхваща и науката и изкуството защото проповядва красив живот в хармония с всемирните закони. 

Истинската наука е артистична и религиозна в най-точния смисъл защото ни учи да почитаме и да се съобразяваме със законите които управляват нашето благополучие и обяснява защо начинът на живот съобразен с религиозните принципи води до здраве и съвършенство. 

Истинското изкуство е просветеност по своята същност както науката и възраждащо по своето въздействие както религията. В архитектурата срещаме най-субливното представяне на космическите силови линии във вселената. Тя изпълва духовния човек с мощно обожание и преклонение, породени от благоговейната концепция за властващото над всичко великолепие и величие на Всевишния. Скулптурата и изобразителното изкуство, музиката и литературата ни вдъхновяват с чувство за превъзхождащата всичко любов на Бог, безсмъртен източник и цел за целия прекрасен свят. 

Нищо по-малко от едно такова всеобхватно учение би могло да отговори на нуждите на голямата и напредваща група от хора, затова техно-насочената религия е абсолютно необходима понастоящем. 

### <h3 id="question-148">ВЪПРОС No.148</h3>

Възможно ли е да се култивира ясновидство посредством използването на наркотици, посредством взиране в кристал или посредством дихателни упражнения и дали тези методи не дават по-бърз резултат от методите които препоръчвате вие? 

Отговор: Да, възможно е да се развие определен вид ясновидство посредством който и да е от споменатите методи, но когато човек придобива шесто чувство по такъв начин той не е господар на своята способност; силата за осъществяване на ясновидство се съдържа в кристала, но не и в човека.Той е в подобно положение на човек който се учи да язди в школа за езда където конете са обучени да позволяват да бъдат яздени. Ученикът не придобива способност да се спрвя с непокорни животни, а просто язди защото животните му позволяват. 

Ако човек се научи да подчинява един див кон той ще може да подчинява и други и да язди посредством собствената си способност да бъде господар на коня. И когато човек е използвал собствената си воля вместо наркотични вещества и взиране в кристал за да покори собственото си тяло и да култивира ясновидство, той ще е придобил качество на душата което ще му позволява да го използва през всички бъдещи животи. Ако е ползвал взиране в кристал и наркотици, той ще загуби тяхната сила при смъртта си и ще трябва да чака за кристал и наркотици до новия си живот за да тренира новото тяло и затова резултатът от използването на тези методи е загуба на време и усилия. Ако вземем под внимание факта, че наркотиците и дихателните упражнения имат ужасен разрушителен ефект върху организма, ще стане ясно 1е тези методи са изобщо неприемливи. Много хора се намират в заведения за душевно болни или в санаториуми за туберкулозни поради практикуване на дихателни упражнения, а ефектът от използването на наркотици е добре известен. 

Всъщност, има различни ясновидци. Има такива които притежават такива ка1ества, че могат да бъдат уподобени на затворник в килия зад решетки. През прозореца на килията се открива някаква гледка; той не може да избегне гледането на това което се открива пред погледа му защото не може да се обърне и да избяга. Пред прозореца в килията му има и капаци които той също не може да контролира. Така че, когато капаците са отворени, той трябва да гледа всичко което минава пред прозореца независимо от това дали гледката му харесва или не.Способност от такъв вид е абсолютно проклятие защото понякога пред погледа на такъв ясновидец се разиграват ужасни сцени. Авторът си спомня случая на един господин който притежаваше такъв вид способност. Веднъж когато той е изнасял лекция пред някакво събрание по време на войната във Филипините, пред неговия взор се е появила сцена от сблъсъка между филипинците и нашите войници. Той видял разкъсани коне които падат и вътрешностите им се влачат по земята, нашите разсичани на парчета от щиковете на местните и т.н. В невъзможност да изключи видението, той смъртно пребледнял, но тренираната му воля му позволила да завърши лекцията без да привлече вниманието на публиката. 

Има други ясновидци които имат само частичен контрол върху зрението си и не могат да разчитат на способността си по всяко време. Към тази група принадлежи обикновения медиум който продава способностите си срещу възнаграждение. По времето когато силата е включена тя може да дава много добро тълкуване и да казва истината, но друг път когато силата е изключена може да има изкушение да симулира ясновидство за да си осигури заплащането необходимо за наема на офиса или лични нужди. 

Единственият безопасен начин за култивиране на качеството ясновидство е посредством тренировката предлагана от мистерийните школи, но тези упражнения и напътствия за развитие на висши способности никога не се продават за пари или каквито и да е материални ценности. Те винаги се дават безплатно като заслужена награда. Човек който притежава тази способност, култивирана посредством техните методи, няма почиви дни, но той никога няма да се съгласи да я използва за да задоволи нечие любопитство, за тестове или други несериозни цели. Той насочва цялата си енергия за да помогне за възхода на човечеството. 

### <h3 id="question-149">ВЪПРОС No.149</h3>

Кое е най-подходящото време сутрин за концентрация? 

Отговор: Целта на духовните тренировъчни упражнения, и сутрешното и вечерното, е да доведе ученика в съзнателен досег с Невидимите Светове и няма по-добро време от сутринта, защото през нощта духът излиза от плътното тяло и встъпва в невидимия свят изоставяйки тялото в спящо състояние; а това което кара тялото да се събуди сутрин и фокусира съзнанието ни върху материалния свят посредством сетивата, е завръщането на духа. Wordsworth ни предлага хубавата си: 

```
‘’Ода за безсмъртието’’:   
Душата която се появява с нас, нашата звезда на живота,   
Е била някъде другаде и идва от далече:   
Не в пълна забрава и не в абсолютна голота,   
А носеща облаци от слава защото идваме от Бог, който е нашия дом:’’   

‘’Небесата се разстилат около нас през нашето ранно детство!   
Сенките на затвора започват да се затварят около растящото момче,   
Но той съхранява светлината, и накъдето и да се разпространява,   
Той я вижда в своята радост.’’   

‘’Младостта, която всеки ден идва от изток   
Трябва първо да пътува, докато е свята   
И от великолепно видение е привлечена по своя път;   
Накрая човек я възприема и тя умира   
И избледнява в светлината на идващия ден.’’   
```

През живота на човек, Вътрешните Светове са по близо до него през годините на детството, както казва Wordsworth, защото тогава е утрото на живота, така е и за нас; когато се събуждаме сутрин ние сме в най-близък контакт с Духовните Светове в сравнение с всяко друго време от деня и тогава е най-лесно да се върнем в тях. Затова, ученикът би трябвало да изпълнява упражненията си точно в момента на събуждането, без да позволява на мисълта да се отклонява в никаква друга посока. Той би трябвало да отпусне тялото си напълно, така че нито един мускул да не е напрегнат и да съсредоточи мисълта си върху висок идеал или върху първите пет стиха на Евангелието на Св. Йоан – или изречение по изречение или като цяло. Това ще го накара да се докосне до космическите вибрации. Той би трябвало да притъпи сетивата си така, че да не чува нищо. Когато успее, картините от Света на Желанията ще се появят пред неговото вътрешно зрение. Отначало само понякога, по-късно все по по-често и все по-ясни и системното практикуване ще ги направи перфектни. 

За повечето хора, обаче, вечерното упражнение е от по-голяма важност и вероятно ще донесе по-бързо положителен резултат, защото то оказва въздействие върху живота който водим и ни облагородява така, както сутрешното упражнение не може. 

### <h3 id="question-150">ВЪПРОС No.150</h3>

Трудно ми е да преглеждам събитията на деня в обратен ред докато правя вечерното упражнение. Това абсолютно задължително ли е, и ако е, защо? 

Отговор: По време на вечерното упражнение ученикът преглежда и преценява живота си за този ден. Тогава той извършва работата, която обикновено е предназначена за Чистилището и Първото Небе. Там живота се живее в обратна посока, от ефектите към причините, с цел да разберем как и защо страдания са резултат от нашите грешки. Преглеждайки живота си за деня, в обратен ред от ефектите към причините, ние забелязваме че всичките ни беди и изпитания са били причинени от предишни действия през изминалия ден или през някой друг ден от нашия живот. 

Нашата задача е да открием тази причина и да анализираме какво предизвиква всяко събитие, така че в бъдеще да знаем как да се възползваме от обстоятелствата за душевен растеж и да избягваме погрешното. Затова, ако проследяваме ежедневните преживявания в обратен ред, ние печелим чрез натрупване на опит сега, веднага, вместо да чакаме докато сме напуснали този живот и сме принудени да събираме плодовете на нашите дела в Чистилището и на Първото Небе. 

### <h3 id="question-151">ВЪПРОС No.151</h3>

Какво значение имат дихателните упражнения за развитието на тялото и ума? 

Отговор: Значението на дихателните упражнения зависи от познанията на човека който ги предлага. Дихателните упражнения дадени в издания на така наречени учители, които се намират чрез обяви за курсове по екстрасензорно развитие, са изключително опасни и много хора са се озовали в психиатрични клиники или са умрели от туберкулоза защото са се опитвали да ги практикуват. 

Всяко човешко същество е индивидуалност и има нужда от индивидуални упражнения. Подходящите упражнения може да бъдат дадени само от човек, който е ясновидец и следователно е в състояние да наблюдава израстването на определени етерни органи във физическото тяло на неговия ученик. Той, също така, трябва да знае как да се осъществи това израстване при всеки индивидуален случай. Всеки, който има способността да предоставя тези индивидуални упражнения, също така знае как да проверява за нежелателни ефекти. Но един такъв духовен учител не пуска обяви за екстрасензорно развитие срещу определено заплащане. Такива упражнения никога не са продават за пари, а винаги се дават като заслужена награда. 

Причината е очевидна. Някой, който има способността ясновидство по волева команда, притежава изключително голяма сила; ако се злоупотребява с нея тя може да бъде по-разрушителна от всяко оръжие на земята. Тя може да предизвиква паника в борсите на земята, да предизвиква войни и вражда между хората навсякъде и по този начин притежателят и’ би се превърнал в заплаха за хората, освен ако той не е такъв манталитет че никога не би използвал способността си за друго, освен за добро. Силите, които стоят зад еволюцията, Старшите Братя на човечеството, които са развили тези сили и са способни да обучават хората, се грижат много добре никой да не се добере до тази сила докато не е дал доказателства за безкористност и докато не се е обвързал с клетва и определени ограничения. Поради това, може да се каже че никой не би трябвало да се заема с дихателни упражнения освен ако са препоръчани от подходящ духовен учител и не е нужно да се обикаля света за да се намери такъв учител. Стремящият се е по-добре да се старае да върши добро и да прилага способностите които притежава сега в средата в която живее защото това е най- добрия градивен начин за придобиване на висша сила. Когато се е подготвил достатъчно добре, учителят ще се появи в живота му и той дори и за момент няма да се усъмни в истинската стойност на учението което ще получи В потвърждение на това прилагаме едно много хубаво стихотворение: 

```
‘’Не си губи времето в копнеж по сияйни невъзможни неща;   
Не стой бездейно да чакаш   
Да ти поникнат ангелски крила.   
Не презирай обикновените неща,   
Всеки не може да бъде звезда;   
А разпръсквай част от тъмнината   
Светейки там където си.   

Има нужда и от малка свещица   
Както и от ослепителното Слънце,   
И най-скромното дело облагородява   
Ако е заслужавало да бъде сторено;   
Може би никога няма да бъдеш призован   
Да осветиш далечни тъмни пространства,   
Затова изпълнявай ден след ден мисията си   
Светейки там където си.’’   
```

### <h3 id="question-152">ВЪПРОС No.152</h3>

Не е ли невидимият свят, за който разказвате, много нереален и мъгляв в сравнение с този свят в който живеем сега? 

Отговор:Бог е първичната реалност. Светът на Желанията и Светът на Мисълта са на една и две крачки по-близо до централния източник на енергия и следователно те са по-реални. Да бъде ‘’реален’’, задаващият въпроса вероятно свързва с факта, че в този свят формите са стабилни и не се променят лесно, докато в Невидимите Светове те са повече от неустойчиви и пластични и се променят със скоростта на мисълта, но животът вътре е реалността, а не формата. Стабилността не е признак на реалност. Всичко на света, което сега е изкристализирало и е стабилно, първо е съществувало в пластичен вид в Невидимия Свят. Всичко, което е сътворено от ръката на човек, е било първо в състояние на мисловна форма в ума на създателя си. 

Когато един архитект възнамерява да построи къща, той първо обмисля това. Той се стреми да оформи една идея възможно най-ясно – как трябва да изглежда къщата. Ако строителят би бил способен да вижда мисловната форма в ума на архитекта, той би могъл да работи без план, но идеята на архитекта е скрита от него под булото на плътта и затова е необходимо архитектът да изложи идеята си на хартия и да изготви план. Това е първия етап на кристализация; след това строителят построява къщата от желязо, дърво и камък. 

Според повечето хора, тази къща е много по-реална от мисловната форма в ума на архитекта, но в действителност това не е така. Бетонната къща може да бъде моментално разрушена от земетресение, от взрив или по друг начин, но идеята в ума на архитекта ще съществува докато той е жив и от тази идея може да бъде построена нова къща, или много къщи, по всяко време, да, дори и след смъртта на архитекта къщата все още ще съществува като модел в етера и всеки ясновидец който е в състояние да контактува с Невидимия Свят и да чете в паметта на природата, може да го види там по всяко време, въпреки че може да са отминали милиони години. Затова Невидимият Свят е източника и вечния запис на всичко което е или е било тук, следователно той е основната реалност. 

<h2 id="section-7">РАЗДЕЛ VII: Въпроси отнасящи се до АСТРОЛОГИЯТА</h2> 

### <h3 id="question-153">ВЪПРОС No.153</h3>

Възможно ли е астрологията и хиромантията да дават вярна информация, дотолкова че да бихме могли да предотвратим приближаващо се нещастие, ако сме предупредени по този начин? И не би ли се отразило това на съдбата ни? 

Отговор: Съдбата която ние създаваме под действието на закона за причинно- следствената връзка чрез своите собствени действия, може да бъде разделена на три вида. На първо място, има съдба която поради самата същност на случилото се събитие, не може да се изкупи в настоящия живот, например когато човек извърши убийство, дали ще изтърпи наказание за това тук или не, животът в затвора обикновено няма такава ефективност която да направи човека по- милостив и по-добър. Понякога се получава обратното; затворът го прави по- ожесточен и той се настройва против всички. Преди да се уравновеси кармата, той трябва да научи, че не му е позволено да лишава сродно същество от неговата форма; той трябва да се научи да служи. Затова случаят не е ликвидиран докато той не е получил възможността в бъдеще да се отплати чрез интензивно служене на предишната си жертва. 

Вторият вид съдба ние изкупваме всекидневно: то е, може да се каже, като разплащане с пари, плащаме на момента. Ако преядем, получаваме стомашно неразположение; ако излезем навън без да сме достатъчно добре облечени получаваме настинка и т.н. 

Третият вид се нарича ‘’зряла’’ или ‘’узряла’’ съдба. Тя е резултат от нашите действия в предишни животи или през нашите ранни години и тя е узряла до ефект или последствие до такава степен, че е включена в картините показвани на духа като панорама на настъпващия му живот когато той започва ново прераждане. След като духът е избрал определен живот със ‘’зряла’’ съдба предложена му за ликвидиране от Записващите Ангели, той е обвързан със своя избор. Тенденциите да действа по този начин който ще компенсира и уравновеси тази зряла съдба са вградени и са присъщи на тялото му и са записани в звездната му карта, защото звездните влияния са източника на човешката активност и затова тази зряла съдба може да се види в рождения хороскоп, изключително ясно показана, така че тя е напълно открита за астролог или хиромант със спиритически способности. Той, също така, може да види и другите видове съдба и понякога може да сбърка един вид с друг и следователно да греши в мнението си за това дали едно събитие може да бъде избегнато или не. Ако е ‘’зряла’’ съдба, ще бъде невъзможно да се избегне, както следният пример ще помогне да се покаже това. 

През 1906 година авторът даде няколко урока по астрология на господин Л, добре известен лекар в Лос Анжелис, използвайки личния хороскоп на господина с цел инструкциите да бъдат по-добре предадени и възприети, защото това позволява ученикът да провери истинността на интерпретациите на символите доколкото се засяга миналото и предизвиква по-голям интерес отколкото ако се използва хороскоп на непознат човек. Стана ясно, че г-н Л е преживял няколко произшествия, времето когато са се случили беше определено до ден. Забелязан беше, също така и предстоящ инцидент, който трябваше да се случи по време на новолунието 21 юли 1906 година. Господин Л беше предупреден затова да си стои у дома на този ден и на седмия ден след тази дата, като по-късната дата беше определена като по-опасна. Казано му беше, че ще има опасност от нараняване на долната част на главата, врата, гърдите и ръцете вследствие на пътуване на късо разстояние с велосипед, лека кола или влак. 

Г-н Л беше впечатлен и обеща да си стои у дома на споменатата дата. Авторът замина на Север и от там изпрати напомнящо писмо на г-н Л за опасността точно преди времето когато инцидентът трябваше да се случи. Той получи в отговор писмо от г-н Л в което той го уверяваше че ще бъде внимателен. 

Следващото съобщение относно този случай дойде от близък приятел и гласеше, че г-н Л отишъл в Сиера Мадре да изнася лекция на 28ми юли и е бил ударен на местата които бяха споменати в предсказанието при катастрофа с влак. Авторът беше учуден защо предупреждението му е било така пренебрегнато и отговорът дойде след три месеца когато г-н Л му благодари за информацията която е била много ценна за него, както той каза, доказвайки истинността на астрологията. Причината за инцидента е била, че той объркал датата. Той мислел ,че 28ми е 29ти. 

Този случай, по преценка на автора, демонстрира че на зрялата съдба не може да се попречи и че каквото и да направим за да се предпазим и да избегнем предстоящата опасност то би се намесило и би попречило на закона за причинно- следствената връзка. Има невидими сили около нас които препятстват всяко наше действие което би се намесило и би попречило, и по мнението на автора, те са причината за объркването датите от г-н Л. 

### <h3 id="question-154">ВЪПРОС No.154</h3>

Погрешно ли е да се използва гледането на ръка, астрологията и френологията като поминък? 

Отговор: Какво е правилно или погрешно зависи от гледната точка.Преди по- малко от петдесет години се смяташе за правилно да се убие непокорен негър. Неговият господар би могъл да направи това безнаказано както би могло в днешно време да се убие яре или кон. Днес ние бихме окачествили това като убийство. Сега някои хора гледат на астрологията в по-голяма степен като на изчисления и на хиромантията и френологията като на практики занимаващи се с чисто материалистическата страна на предмета без никакво спиритическо значение. Който разглежда по този начин тези познания няма да има вина ако ги използва за получаване на средства за живот като поминък, докато някой който е си придобил представа за духовната страна на тези науки, според мнението на автора, би проституирал с това знание. Освен това, никой който по този начин омаловажава тези спиритически науки, не може никога да даде най-добрия съвет на своите клиенти защото блясъкът на златото винаги ще пречи на преценката. Такова е впечатлението на автора и на много други които имат същото мнение. Задаващият въпроса, във всеки случай, би постъпил погрешно използвайки познанията си по тези духовни науки като поминък, защото въпросът му показва, че той може би има съмнения; и после той винаги ще чувства неодобрение отвътре, от самия него, ако продава таланта си. 

Има награда която е много повече от злато. Ако използваме знанията си за да лекуваме и за да помагаме на нас и никога няма да ни липсват средства за живот и ние ще натрупваме съкровище на небесата където всичко е вечно. 

### <h3 id="question-155">ВЪПРОС No.155</h3>

Дали Марс, Юпитер и другите планети са населени; ако е така, тези хора по- висши ли са от хората на земята; дали душите на земята понякога се реинкарнират на други планети и обратното? 

Отговор: Всички планети от слънчевата система са населени и са полета на еволюция за различни класове от духове на различна степен на развитие. Най- близките до Слънцето планети поддържат същества които са най-високо еволюирали. Юпитер представлява изключение от това правило; той е населен с човечество малко по-висше от това на земята. 

Принципът е следния: Най-високите вибрации съществуват в центъра на Слънцето, което някога е съдържало всички същества които сега живеят върху различни планети. Но не всички са били в състояние да издържат мощните вибрации на тази централна огнена мъглявина; затова е започнала кристализация на полюсите; постепенно втвърдилата се материя гравитирала към екватора и е била изхвърлена заедно с духовете живеещи там. Така първата еманация станал Уран. По късно други групи от духове са кристализирали част от Слънцето и са били изхвърлени да се движат по орбити на различни разстояния от централния източник в съответствие със скоростта на вибрациите необходими за развитието на духовете върху тях, формирайки бъдещата слънчева система, такава каквато я познаваме сега. 

Всеки клас духове оставал в своята околна среда бидейки под директното покровителство и водачество на един от Планетните Духове чието тяло е планетата която те обитават. Тъй като духовете са били инкарнирани на различни планети защото те са на твърде различни нива на духовно развитие, те обикновено не се прераждат на други планети, освен когато в миналото някои духове от вътрешните планети са били изпращани като учители на другите планети. Това поне, е бил случаят когато нашето човечество е имало нужда от учители, въплътени и видими. Тогава някои същества от Венера и Меркурий са били изпратени на земята да ръководят зараждащото се човечество. Те са били известни като пратениците на Боговете от Венера, които са били първите царе и са управлявали човешката раса. По-късно, най-напредналите измежду човешките същества са били са били изпратени при Боговете на Меркурий които са ги посветили в мистериите и те, връщайки се, са станали управници на събратята си. Те тогава са били наистина царе по Божия милост, водейки хората към възход и благоденствие, без да злоупотребяват със властта и величието си.

Небуларната теория не обяснява ли по много по-научен начин съществуването на вселената, отколкото разказа за сътворението от Библията? 

Отговор: Небуларната теория беше отхвърлена от Herbert Spenser защото, както Библията, тя изисква като предварително условие Първопричината. 

Разгледана накратко, теорията е следната: някога в пространството се е появила огнена мъгла, спонтанно. Вътре в тази огнена мъгла започнали да протичат токове, също спонтанно, и под въздействието на тези токове огнената мъгла придобила сферична форма въртейки се с голяма скорост. Центробежната сила предизвикала изхвърляне на пръстен който се разпаднал сегментите се съединили и се превърнали в планета въртяща се в орбита около централната маса. По този начин са се образували отделните планети една след друга. Те постепенно се охладили и накрая слънчевата система била завършена. Поне на една от тези планети се появил живот, спонтанно. Животът, или протоплазма, който постепенно еволюирал преминавайки през различни класове – Клетъчни, Мекотели, Членестоноги и Гръбначни, най-накрая увенчавайки се в човек, който е най-висшата интелигентност в Космоса, Господар на всичко около него. 

Ученият твърди това с важно изражение и може също така да добави: ‘’Не разбираш ли колко просто и логично е всичко това? Ако не, нека да ти го демонстрирам’’. Тогава той може да вземе съд пълен с вода и да излее малко масло на повърхността, водата да представлява космоса а маслото – огнената мъгла. След това той може да вземе една игла и да започне да разбърква маслото имитирайки токовете които са били генерирани в огнената мъгла и под въздействието на задвижващото разбъркване маслото ще придобие сферична форма. Постепенно сферата ще се издуе при екватора, един пръстен ще бъде изхвърлен и ще се оформи като планета която ще се върти около маслото от което е произлязла и ученият тогава ще каже триумфално: ‘’Ето, не виждаш ли колко естествено е всичко, няма ни най-малката нужда от твоя Бог!’’ 

Нас ни учудва само това, че хора които имат ум и способност да сътворят тази блестяща демонстрация, може едновременно с това да бъдат толкова глупави, че да не разбират че те, самите те, заемат мястото на Бог, който е измислил и направил така че вселената да съществува, както учените са създали тяхната демонстрация и я привеждат в изпълнение. Бог със своята сила поддържа нашата вселена и движи планетите както ученият движи своята маслена планета, и ако Бог прекъсне своето действие за един единствен миг, космосът мигновено ще се разруши в конгломератен хаос както маслените слънце и планета престават да съществуват в мига в който ученият прекъсне своето движение. 

За това толкова, относно опровергаването на твърдението в Библията че Бог е Създателят и поддържащият космоса, небуларната теория демонстрира необходимостта от божествена интелигентност изцяло, и ако се помисли по подходящ начин, няма съществена разлика между научната и религиозната концепции.

Какво представляват кометите? 

Отговор: Разглеждайки мъдростта на Великите Творчески Йерархии сравнявайки я с нашата собствена, ние естествено се чувстваме склонни да мислим че те не могат да допускат грешки, но при повторно премисляне започва да ни се струва приемливо, че понеже те са все още еволюиращи, въпреки че са учили много по- дълго от нас, и те би трябвало понякога да правят грешки. Те действат в Макрокосмоса – ‘’Големия Свят’’; Тялото на Бог, докато ние живеем в Микрокосмоса – ‘’Малкия Свят’’, съставен от нашите различни тела и точно както ние правим грешки в ежедневните си дела и когато учим уроците си, така също и Великите Творчески Йерархии понякога допускат пропуски в работата си. 

Ние знаем, че когато едно дете е на път да се роди може да се получи спонтанен аборт. Тогава зародишът се изхвърля от организма и веднага започва да се разпада. Съществува подобен риск когато един свят е в процес на създаване, а именно, той кристализира или се втвърдява преди да е завършил зародишния период в Света на Желанията. Тогава той не е изграден правилно и може да бъде описан като купчина гипс забъркана от скулптор от която да извае красива статуя на Парис, но втвърдил се преди да бъде моделиран, една безформена, ненужна маса. Когато това се случи в процеса на сътворяване на един свят, се получава това което ни е известно като комета, а елипсовидната орбита по която тя се движи е траекторията на тока в Света на Желанията. Нещо подобно на комета може да се види при появата на Его преди той да влезе в утробата на майката. Това също е едно тяло с формата на камбана с ядро в горния край и голям обем от материя леещ се отзад подобно на опашката на кометата. И тези камбановидни прераждащи се Его също се движат по елипсовидни орбити около земята докато не стане необходимо да влязат в утробата на бъдещата майка.

Дали движението на една планета през пространството създава шум? 

Отговор: Питагор е говорил за хармонията на сферите и той не е използвал този израз просто като поетическа алегория. Съществува такава хармония. Йоан ни е казал, че в началото е било словото… и без него не е станало нищо от това което е станало. Това е била творческата команда която е дала началото на света. Познатият ни експеримент представляваш пластове от пясък върху стъклена плоча и образуване на геометрични фигури когато прокарваме лък на цигулка по ръба на плочата, илюстрира съзидателната способност на звука. Чували сме за божествената небесна музика, защото от гледна точка на Небесния Свят, всичко в началото е създадено посредством звук който след това моделира твърдата материя в многобройни форми които виждаме около нас. 

От гледна точка на окултиста, цялата слънчева система е един огромен музикален инструмент; за такова нещо се споменава в гръцката митология като за ‘’седемструнната лира на Аполон’’, сияйният Бог Слънце. Тъй както в хроматичната система има 12 полутона, така също на небето има 12 зодиакални знаци и така както на клавиатурата на пияното има 7 бели клавиши или 7 тона, така също има и 7 планети. Зодиакалните знаци, може да се каже че отговарят на звучащия корпус на космическата арфа, а седемте планети представляват струните; те излъчват различни звуци когато преминават през различните знаци и затова влияят на хората по различен начин. Ако хармонията се наруши за една единствена секунда, ако се появи и най слабия дисакорд в този небесен оркестър, цялата вселена би трябвало да се разпадне. Защото музиката така както изгражда, може и да руши. Това е доказано по убедителен начин от великите музиканти. Например внукът на безсмъртния Феликс Менделсон е експериментирал в продължение на няколко години със силата на звука, в тази връзка. Той стигнал до извода, че след като открием ключовата нота на дадена сграда, мост или друг построен обект, ние ще можем да съборим този обект до руини ако свирим тази нота достатъчно силно и продължително. Авторът се сеща за подходящ за случая пример: 

‘’Преди няколко години, една група от музиканти са репетирали близо до стари развалини извън град Хайделберг в Германия. В един момент на своите упражнения те достигнали до един много рязък и дълго продължаващ тон и докато са го свирили масивната стена на близката стара къща се сринала на земята с ужасен трясък. Те били улучили ключовата нота на тази стена и тя се разрушила’’. При запознаването ни с такива факти, пренебрежителните ни усмивки когато слушаме историята на Иисус Навин за Йерихонските стени ще изчезнат. Звукът от тръбещия рог без съмнение е улучил ключовата нота на тези стени, които още повече са подали вследствие на ритмичната маршова стъпка на неговата армия, което ги е подготвило за финалния крах. Ритмичното маршируване на много хора ще разруши всеки мост, затова войниците биват инструктирани да нарушават крачката когато преминават по мост. Така че, в отговор на въпроса можем да кажем, че всяка планета излъчва определен ключов тон, който е сумата от всички генерирани върху нея звуци, смесени и хармонизирани от вътре живеещия Планетарен Дух. Този звук може да бъде чут от спиритическо ухо. Гьоте казва: 

```
‘’Слънцето напява своята древна песен   
В съревнование с припяването на братята сфери;   
По предписания му път то бърза само   
Гръмовно, през годините, открай до край.’’   
```

Този откъс е от първата част на Фауст, прологът на небесата. А така също и във втората част на Фауст, духове на въздуха приветстват изгряващото слънце с думите: 

```
‘’Звук в духовното ухо известява, новият ден е настъпил;   
Каменни порти скърцат, мърморейки,   
Аполонови криле се размахват, пеейки –   
Какъв силен звук донася светлината.’’   
```

Какъв е езотеричния смисъл на използването на имената на дванадесетте сина на Яков във връзка с дванадесетте знаци на зодиака и дали те се използват във връзка със земния зодиак или със слънчевия зодиак или с двата? 

Отговор: Има само един зодиак, дванадесетте съзвездия които се наричат Овен, Телец и т.н.Това са звездите разположени в тесен обръч на около 8 градуса от всяка страна на еклиптиката, или орбитата на Слънцето, както се наблюдават от земята. Дванадесетте синове и дъщерята на Яков се идентифицират с дванадесетте съзвездия защото Йосиф споменава че израелтяните когато са пътували през пустинята са имали емблеми съответстващи на тези дванадесет групи звезди на своите знамена. В 49ти стих от Битие и в 33ти стих на Второзаконие се произнасят благословии към тези дванадесет братя по такъв начин, че е невъзможно за някой който е запознат с астрономията да не забележи приликата между описанието на тези синове и дванадесетте зодиакални знаци. 

Също така, ако се съобразим с начина на построяването на лагера на израелтяните и настаняването на хората в него – групирайки дванадесетте племена около храма където е бил свещеника със седемте разклонения – ние отново виждаме връзката с астрономическото разположение на дванадесетте зодиакални знаци около седемте планети, които са светещите обекти в слънчевата система, Дома на Бог. 

Духовният смисъл на аналогията между Яков, неговите жени, техните деца и космоса може да се открие в херметическата аксиома, каквото горе това и долу. Яков със своите четири жени символизира Слънцето и четирите фази на Луната, които са даряващите живот на всичко което съществува на земята; дванадесетте синове и едната дъщеря символизират Творческите (създаващите) Йерархии, които са били активни по време на еволюцията на нашата слънчева система и които са довели не само човечеството, но и всички други царства до сегашния етап на еволюционно развитие и работят с тях сега с цел да ги развият напред в духовни същества. Те са създали човек такъв какъвто изглежда сега. Дори до днешния ден човешкият род е белязан с характеристиките на дванадесетте божествени знаци. Затова древните Семити, които е трябвало да бъдат прародителите на една нова раса, са били разделени в дванадесет класа от техния водач, всеки клас представляващ едно от съзвездията. 

### <h3 id="question-160">ВЪПРОС No.160</h3>

Можете ли да дадете една идея за разликата между хелиоцентричната и геоцентричната астрологии? Дали геоцентричната засяга само въпроси касаещи тази земя, материалния живот, а хелиоцентричната само душата или духовната страна? Слънцето, бидейки духовната планета и управител на нашата слънчева система, може да е основа за такова заключение, тъй като ние използваме слънчевия знак в хелиоцентричната астрология и земния зодиак в геоцентричната. Могат ли изобщо да се направят предсказания за този живот посредством слънчевия зодиак или той просто касае духовната страна природата на един човек? 

Отговор: Едно от възраженията повдигнати срещу древната система на астрологията е че тя приема земята за център на слънчевата система по същия начин както древните са смятали и, че откакто Коперник показа че планетите се движат около Слънцето, много хора считат астрологията като ‘’една бламирала се наука’’, очевидно доказана заблуда; и с цел да се преборят с това възражение, някои астролози в днешно време са измислили това което се нарича ‘’Хелиоцентрична Астрология’’, която счита Слънцето за център на нашата слънчева система и планетите като движещи се около него. 

Съвършено вярно е, че погледнато от научна гледна точка, геоцентричната система на астрологията която разглежда земята като център е погрешна. Не е правилно когато казваме, че Слънцето е в Рак, когато в действителност земята движейки се по своята орбита е достигнала знака Козирог и поради това, за нас тук на земята, изглежда като че ли Слънцето е в Рак. Но трудността не е в това; наистина няма значение кое от двете небесни тела се е движило, астрологът прави преценка съобразно позициите на планетите относно земята. И много по-удобно е да се разглеждат планетите като движещи се около земята като център, отколкото да се използва обратната метода, защото в геоцентричната система ние взимаме под внимание взаимодействието между планетите така както изглеждат от нашата земя и отбелязваме ефектите върху различни хора по времето когато такива взаимодействия са се случили и така, от опит, емпирически ние сме достигнали до нашата сегашна система на преценка която, поради това, е толкова вярна днес както винаги е била. Астрологията се доказва чрез истинността на предсказанията си и всеки който е изучавал тази наука и се е опитвал да я изпитва върху себе си няма да пропусне да се увери в тази истинност. 

Предсказанията понякога се правят защото астрологът греши в интерпретацията, но дори да приемем че астрологът може да допусне грешка, съществуват безусловно толкова много предсказания които се сбъдват, че това не може да бъде обяснено като съвпадение. 

Геоцентричната система е правилна и обхваща всички страни на човешката природа, не само материалното проявление, но също така и духовния аспект. Хелиоцентричната система, от друга страна, е създадена от хора които се стремят да се съобразяват с науката и не се интересуват от духовната страна на природата, затова тя е по-малко приемлива. Освен това, понеже тези които са използвали геоцентричната астрология от много векове са записали своите наблюдения и съображения относно влиянието на планетите от нейната позиция, но има много малко такива емпирични знания от позицията на хелиоцентричната система която, бихме посъветвали задаващия въпроса, да не използва.

По какъв начин е възможно да бъдем в добри отношения със Сатурн? Задаващият въпроса е бил под неговото влияние през целия си живот. Болести, бедност, загуба на наследство и злополуки са достатъчно зло, но може ли Сатурн също така да ни причини и неприятности от духовно естество; може ли да постави бариери пред развитието ни когато духът ни се стреми към доброто и дали се освобождаваме от неговото влияние когато напускаме този свят при смъртта? 

Отговор: Астролозите материалисти определят Уран, Сатурн и Марс като зли, докато Венера и Юпитер като благотворни. В Божието Царство няма нищо зло. Това което изглежда така е само добро в процес на ставане. Нито пък трябва да си въобразяваме че влиянието от която и да е планета действа така, че да напада човека. Ние сме дошли на този свят с цел да натрупаме определена опитност необходима за нашето духовно развитие и, ако желаем да разберем звездните влияния, ние бихме се убедили че те са мощни фактори помагайки ни да придобием точно тази опитност. Сатурн е налагащият дисциплина или този който поправя чрез наказание. Ако сме се отклонили от верния път, от гледна точка на звездното влияние, с наше желание или неосъзнато, на нас не ни се разрешава да продължим в погрешното защото Сатурн се явява за да ни спре. Може би сме получили наследство; ние злоупотребяваме с него и го прахосваме. Правейки това ние обикновено злоупотребяваме и с нашето тяло. Тогава се появява аспект към Сатурн, получава се болест и ние сме повалени. Принудени сме да спазваме диета и да дадем почивка на организма си и като резултат ставаме от болничното легло като нов човек. Но възниква въпроса, научили ли сме си урока? По време на боледуването ние сме имали време да мислим за живота който сме водили. Анализирали ли сме живота си, така че да разберем причината за заболяването си. Ако е така, ние сме спечелили. Защото от тук нататък ще знаем как да живеем по-добре и в бъдеще да избягваме уловките които причиняват болест. Или цялото наследство е пропиляно, ние се озоваваме с празни джобове на улицата. Може би няма към кого да се обърнем за помощ; тогава сме принудени да се замислим и да си предначертаем нов път. Способностите ни са били безполезни докато сме харчили парите си. В бедността те стават необходимост, ние сме длъжни да ги използваме изпълнявайки нашата част от работата на света. Загубили сме наследството си, но светът е придобил работник и ако сме си научили урока по този начин, тогава влиянието на Сатурн е било прикрита благословия. 

И така е с всичко в хороскопа което може да изглежда зло. Освен това, колкото повече израстваме духовно, толкова по-малко ще ни засягат тези така наречени злотворни планети или лоши аспекти. Те се трансформират в добро. Сатурн няма да причинява нещастие на духовния човек, а издръжливост; няма да причинява болест, а сила; и така приспособявайки се към всемирните закони, живеейки в хармония със звездите, ние властваме над тях и променяме живота си както желаем. 

По-голямата част от човечеството се носи по течението на живота и действа съобразно с тенденциите създадени от звездните влияния. Затова астрологът може да предскаже какво ще правят с много голяма точност. Но колкото повече един човек води извисен духовен начин на живот, толкова повече той се превръща във фактор който трябва да се вземе под внимание и предсказанието на астролога ще се провали повече или по-малко в зависимост от напредъка на този човек. 

Звездите са нашите помощници в еволюцията. Те не са мъртви материални тела, а са живи пулсиращи и вибриращи тела на високо духовни интелигенции наречени в Християнската религия Седемте Духове пред трона. Когато ние се променяме и тяхното влияние върху нас се променя, но ние не се освобождаваме от влиянието им просто чрез събитието смърт. Когато се зазори утрото на нов живот за нас, ние ще се изправим с нов хороскоп и ако сме се старали да израстваме духовно, да усвояваме уроците на които Звездните Ангели са се помъчили да ни научат в предишния живот, ние ще имаме нови аспекти и нови позиции на планетите да ни помагат по-нататък по пътя на еволюцията. От друга страна, ако сме ‘’ритали срещу остена’’ в предишния живот, ние ще открием, че юздите са се затегнали още малко по-силно, че сме поставени под влияния малко по-силни, така че накрая все пак ще трябва да сме научили урока. И колкото по-бързо го направим, толкова по-добре за нас. 

### <h3 id="question-162">ВЪПРОС No.162</h3>

Как може да се молим на Сатурн, когато той е управляваща звезда причинявайки ни неприятности и страдания? 

Отговор: За да се разбере какво представлява молитвата, нека да използваме като илюстрация една електроцентрала с проводници към различни здания. Във всяка къща има шалтер и като го включим, напрежението генерирано в електроцентралата навлиза по проводниците в нашето жилище, осветява го и задвижва уреди, съобразно законите на своето проявление. Може да се каже, че Бог на първо място и Планетните Духове на второ място съответстват на електроцентралата която е свързана посредством проводници към всеки от нас, а молитвата, може да се каже, е шалтера или ключа посредством който ние се поставяме в съприкосновение с божествената светлина и живота, позволявайки му да протича в нас и да ни извисява духовно. 

Законът е такъв, че електричеството ще тече лесно през мед и други метали, но се препятства от стъкло и затова преди да пропуснем електричеството в нашите домове ние трябва да имаме шалтер направен съгласно закона, ключ от мед. Ако използваме ключ от стъкло, няма да получим никакво електричество; стъкленият ключ би бил най-подходящия начин да спрем навлизането на електрическия ток в нашето жилище. Подобно, ако нашите молитви (които отговарят на ключа) са в унисон със законите на Бог, божественият източник може да се проявява чрез нас и нашите молитви са били изпълнени, но ако се молим противно на волята на Бог, естествено, такава молитва ще изиграе ролята на ключ от стъкло в електрическата верига. 

Както една велика нация изпраща своите посланик и пълномощен министър в други държави, така също има посланици от всеки велик Звезден Ангел на нашата земя. Техните имена са следните: 

Итуриел е представител на Уран   
Касиел Сатурн   
Захариел Юпитер   
Самаел Марс   
Анаел Венера   
Рафаел Меркурий   
Михаел Слънце   
Габриел Луна   

Луната е наш спътник и не е със същата позиция както останалите планети. Представителите от тях са Архангели, докато Габриел е Ангел. 

Обикновените хора се молят на Бога. Повечето от тези молитви в днешно време са себични и глупави. Молитвите на тези хора не могат да привлекат вниманието на пратениците (или действащите сили) които са отговорни за различните области от живота, но основно се взимат под внимание от Невидимите Помощници които работят за духовното повдигане на своите събратя. Окултният астролог, обаче, който знае какво иска и е в състояние да работи в хармония със звездните сили, се насочва директно към посланиците на Звездните Ангели и получава, по този начин, по-лесно желаното от него. Той изучава планетарните часове когато съответните звезди упражняват контрол и през това време изказва молбата си която обикновено е за някой друг, или за духовно просветление относно определени въпроси, което да бъде използвано за всеобщо добро.

### <h3 id="question-163">ВЪПРОС No.163</h3>

Защо животните, които принадлежат към по-късна еволюция, имат инстинкт който изглежда по-верен и надежден, отколкото разума на човешките същества? 

Отговор: Отговорът на този въпрос ще се открие като разгледаме спускането на Его в материята, но на първо място ние трябва да разграничим духовете на отделните животни от груповия дух, който е техния опекун. Отделните животински духове все още не са себе съзнателни, следователно без съмнение те действат съобразно внушенията на груповия дух. Груповият дух е създание принадлежащо към различна еволюция и той действа в Невидимите Светове където нещата са в много по-голяма степен ясно изразени отколкото тук. От това следва, че това което ние наричаме инстинкт е в действителност внушението на груповия дух в Невидимия Свят, който покровителства и контролира животните. 

Човешките духове, от друга страна, са се спуснали директно във Физическия Свят и следователно са заслепени до определена степен от плътната материя на тази област на съществуванието. Може би една илюстрация ще послужи добре за да направи ясен смисъла на факта, че въпреки че духът е изключително мъдър в по- висшите светове, повишаващата се плътност на материята която той достига при спускането си, задължително замъглява неговата мъдрост. 

Ръката е най-ценния инструмент на човек и нейната сръчност може би никъде другаде не се проявява така добре както при свиренето на музикален инструмент. Майсторът може да произведе от своя обичан инструмент най-вдъхновяваща душата мелодия посредством най-лек и нежен допир на своите добре тренирани и чувствителни пръсти, но нека да си сложи чифт ръкавици и веднага деликатният допир е изчезнал; ако той добави втори чифт ръкавици върху първия и ако те са по-дебели и от по-плътна материя, той може би няма да е в състояние да произведе никаква мелодия и ако накрая си сложи и боксьорски ръкавици, той няма въобще да може да свири, ще се получи дисхармоничен звук, ако се опита. Различните ръкавици върху ръката на музиканта съответстват на различните тела носители които духът си облича в своето спускане в материята. Боксьорската ръкавица съответства на физическото тяло. 

Всеки който е свидетел на опита на един музикант да свири с боксьорска ръкавица на ръката си и който не го е слушал да свири преди да си сложи ръкавиците, може да предположи, че той въобще не може да свири, но това заключение би било погрешно. Човешкият Его е в подобно положение, неговите духовни сили са скрити под носителите в които сега той е окован, но ще дойде време когато той ще се е научил как правилно да използва тези носители и тогава неговата духовна сила ще блести във великолепие което е невъзможно да си представим сега.

Имаме ли право да убиваме безобидните, след като всяко живо същество е в известен смисъл наш брат? 

А какво ще кажете за отровните насекоми и влечуги? 

Отговор: Има само един живот във Вселената, който е живота на Бог. ‘’В него ние живеем и се движим и съществуваме’’. И не само ние, а всичко което живее е проявление на Бог. След време и ние ще станем създатели, както Той е Създател. Но докато брутално унищожаваме формите на други същества ние си пречим и се забавяме. Задаващият въпроса е прав когато казва, че по-нисшите от нас, животните, са наши братя, но жалко е да се каже че вместо да се грижим за тях и да им вдъхваме чувство на доверчивост и любов, ние сме успели да направим себе си страшни за всяко животно на земята чрез безмилостното им унищожаване. И наистина, изглежда като заслужено наказание, че ние от своя страна трябва да се намираме в състояние на постоянен страх от микроскопичен живот под формата на микроби които не могат да бъдат убити с пушка или нож. 

А що се отнася до опасните насекоми и влечуги в много случаи за тях може да се каже, че са въплъщението на нашите собствени зли мисли и са възникнали от нашите собствени лоши привички. Науката е дала решение за това как посредством подходящи методи на хигиена и дезинфекция можем да се освободим от тях, поне до голяма степен, без необходимост да убиваме. По- големите влечуги, като змиите, често те не са толкова опасни както се мисли за тях. В храмовете на Индия, където определени хора са създали атмосфера на абсолютна безопасност чрез отказ от убиване дори на най-малкото създание, човек може да види всекидневното присъствие на отровни змии пълзящи сред хората които се молят там и никога не им причиняват и най-малката вреда. И ако ние бихме култивирали добронамерено поведение спрямо по-нисшите същества, те скоро ще се научат да ни имат доверие в такава степен, в каквато сега се страхуват от нас. Има документирани истории за моряци попаднали на самотни острови където човешки крак не е стъпвал никога преди това и са заварвали птиците там напълно лишени от страх докато не са били убити няколко от тях от нашествениците. Тогава птиците са се научили да отлитат при приближаването на човек. 

Ние, също така, сме превърнали човешки същества в зверове – наричаме ги крадци и престъпници – които устройват засада и причакват свои събратя, лишават ги от притежанията им и често ги нараняват телесно, стига се дори до извършване на убийство, и всичко това като резултат от нашето безчувствено и грубо отношение което се диктува от страха. Ако притежавахме любов нямаше да изпитваме страх, ‘’защото съвършената любов побеждава всеки страх’’; и ако нямахме страх нищо не би ни наранило, защото безстрашното и доверчиво поведение е по-сигурна защита от пистолет и ключалка. Затова, ние трябва да култивираме такова поведение на любов към всичко което живее и диша; ние трябва да престанем да убиваме по-нисшите животни с милиони за храна и за спорт, което е най-лошата форма на жестокост. Едно поведение на любов към ближните ни би генерирало у тях същите емоции и ключарят и майсторът на оръжия много скоро ще станат излишни. Ние се оплакваме от огромните данъци необходими за издръжката на силна полиция, правната система, затворите и изправителните домове, но всички тези институции ще изчезнат по магически начин ако бихме заменили страха с любов. Библията ни показва времето когато лъвът и телето, малкото дете и отровното влечуго ще играят заедно в мир. Това наистина може да стане факт защото зверовете не винаги са били месоядни. В далечното минало човек е взимал участие в тяхното развитие и в бъдеще негова задача ще бъде да промени сегашните условия. 

### <h3 id="question-165">ВЪПРОС No.165</h3>

Не са ли отровните и опасни влечуги създадени от злите мисли на човек, поне до колкото се отнася до формата? И затова не е ли акт на любов убиването им, като по този начин освобождаваме божествената искра вътре в тях, така че тя да се посели в по-висша форма? 

Отговор:Нито една от животинските форми които виждаме около нас не е била създадена от човек. Тези всички форми, от най-висшата до най-нисшата, са еманации на груповите духове които са духовни същности принадлежащи към различна еволюция от еволюцията на човешкото царство. Но човек е създател посредством своите мисли. И злите мисли, мислите породени от страх и омраза, те приемат форма и в продължение на векове кристализират в известните ни болествотворни микроби. Микробите на инфекциозните заболявания са в частност въплъщение на страх и омраза и затова те биват побеждавани и преодолявани чрез противоположната сила, силата на куража. Както един камертон ще започне да трепти когато ударим друг камертон настроен на същия тон, по същия начин ще реагират и тези микроскопични бацили. Ако се доближим до човек болен от заразна болест с треперещи от страх ние със сигурност ще привлечем към себе си смъртоносните микроби. Ако, от друга страна, се приближим към този човек съвършено без страх, ние ще избегнем заразяването, особено ако сме изпълнени с любов. Но любовта не ни подбужда да убиваме, в обикновения смисъл на тази дума. Истина е, че ако можехме да боравим директно с живота на опасни и отровни същества и да ги подпомогнем към развитие в по- висша форма, ние бихме сторили добро; но на първо място, ние не сме способни да преценяваме дали тази настояща форма е отживяла полезността си и затова не можем да си позволим да поемем отговорността да лишим живота в тази форма от инструмента му поради милосърдие породено от любов. Единственият случай когато ни е позволено и е уместно да убием от любов е когато едно животно е осакатено без надежда да се поправи и ние го убиваме за да прекратим страданията му.

Какво представлява груповият дух, къде се намира той и как изглежда? 

Отговор: Както човек има тяло съставено от много клетки, всяка с индивидуално съзнание, така и груповият дух е създание функциониращо в Духовните Светове и притежаващо духовно тяло съставено от много отделни животински духове. Самият групов дух не може да функционира във Физическия Свят, но той еволюира като изпраща различни животински духове във формата на тяло което той създава и което след това формира определен вид или порода животни, а груповият дух ръководи тези животни посредством внушения които ние наричаме инстинкти. Когато тялото на едно животно умре, животинският дух несъзнателно е придобил определен опит посредством функционирането в този носител и след време този опит се абсорбира в духовното тяло на груповия дух, където остава за известно време докато груповият дух асимилира опита натрупан от този отделен животински дух. По този начин с течение на времето груповият дух еволюира и израства. Същото правят и животинските духове които са неговите подопечни. Те ще станат хора, през бъдеща инкарнация на земята и тогава груповият дух ще се грижи за тях като расов или национален дух докато те станат напълно в състояние да се грижат за себе си индивидуално. Груповият дух на животните е в Света на Желанията и кръжи около земната повърхност. Груповите духове на растенията са в тази част на Областта на Конкретната Мисъл, която заема центъра на земята и груповите духове на минералите всъщност все още не са навлезли в атмосферата на нашата земя. Те са в областта на Абстрактната мисъл. 

Груповите духове на животните много често се виждат в Света на Желанията като притежаващи човешко тяло и глава на животно. Изображенията в египетските храмове представят в груб вид външния вид на тези групови духове. Обученият посветен изследовател без трудности общува с тях и често има поводи да се възхищава на техния разум. 

### <h3 id="question-167">ВЪПРОС No.167</h3>

Дали животните са подвластни на закона за причинно-следствената връзка? 

Отговор: Не, не и в смисъл да имат морална отговорност.Разбира се, ако едно животно скочи от прозореца на една висока сграда, това би му причинило увреждания, в зависимост от това как е паднало, точно по същия начин както ако един човек е скочил от прозореца. Но в случая на животното е на лице само физическият ефект или само нараняването от което страда, докато човекът който по свободна воля извършва такова действие, не само че получава определени увреждания, но той също така е нравствено отговорен за инструмента който притежава и законът за причинно-следствената връзка му дава подходящо нравствено заслужено наказание като възмездие от такъв характер, че той да се научи за в бъдеще да се грижи за своя инструмент, а не да иска го унищожи посредством такова действие. 

Причината, поради която животното няма нравствена отговорност е, че то няма разсъдъчна способност, а просто действа под указанията на груповия дух което ние наричаме инстинкт, и може би този инстинкт е внушил страх у животното което е причинило извършването на действие с резултат нараняване на тялото му. Преди някой да бъде нравствено отговорен пред закона за причинно- следствената връзка той трябва да притежава определена свободни воля и избор, също така способността да разсъждава в прилична степен и затова повтаряме отново, че понеже животните са лишени от тези качества, те изобщо не са подвластни нравствено на закона за причинно-следствената връзка. 

### <h3 id="question-168">ВЪПРОС No.168</h3>

Живеят ли животните след смъртта? 

Отговор: Това което живее е духа, който няма нито начало нито край, ТОЙ Е. Но това което Вие имате пред вид е, най-вероятно, дали той остава във формата на животно. На такъв въпрос бихме отговорили да, той остава за по-дълго или по- кратко време, в зависимост от нивото на неговата еволюция, в тяло на желанията изградено от материята на Света на Желанията. Дори бръмбарът който пълзи по тротоара и е бил настъпен може да бъде видян от един ясновидец да се предвижва на около метър по-нататък и после постепенно да изчезва. Той остава само за няколко секунди във формата си преди духът да се върне към централния източник на груповия дух. Когато става въпрос за кон, за крава или за някое друго по-висше животно, съответното време е по-продължително и има повече съзнателност в Света на желанията отколкото при по-нисшите форми. За илюстрация може да споменем един случай който предизвика голям интерес преди няколко години когато Rider Haggard, един английски писател, публикува забележително съновидение. Той е имал куче към което е бил много силно привързан и една нощ той сънувал, че кучето идва при него давайки признаци на тревога и безпокойство, приканвайки го да го последва. Rider Haggard в своя сън тръгва след кучето което го отвежда до един поток намиращ се наблизо. Там всред тръстиката то показва на Rider Haggard себе си легнало и мъртво, поглежда го с жална и безмълвна молба в погледа за някакво обяснение. 

Когато се събудил на следващата сутрин той помнел съня много ясно, но не му обърнал голямо внимание докато по-късно през деня не се установило, че кучето го няма. След като го потърсили в квартала, Rider Haggard най- накрая се озовал на мястото което сънувал Там той намерил в тръстиката тялото на свето куче в същото положение както го видял в съня си. Обяснение, естествено, не е могло да бъде дадено; това е било странно и загадъчно преживяване и това било всичко. Но за окултиста е много ясно, че интелигентното куче срещнало смъртта и озовало се в Света на Желанията през нощта, отишло при своя стопанин, който през това време също е бил извън своето тяло и го отвело до мястото на злополучното събитие за да получи неговите помощ и обяснение. 

### <h3 id="question-169">ВЪПРОС No.169</h3>

Когато един домашен любимец, куче или котка умре, дали целият групов дух, към който то принадлежи, умира заедно с него? Също така, какво се случва с душата на животното и дали човешките любов и грижа които е получавало, му помагат в неговото по-нататъшно пътуване нагоре? 

Отговор: Въпросът показва, че питащият няма правилна представа за това какво представлява един групов дух. Както нашето тяло е съставено от безброй много клетки и всяка микроскопична клетка има свой собствен живот но всички клетки са подчинени на нашата собствена интелигентна същност, така и груповият дух на даден клас животни е духовно същество принадлежащо към различна еволюция и имащо духовно тяло съставено от много еволюиращи животински духове. Тези животински духове той изпраща в инкарнация от време на време в тела на животни от вида който е подчинен на него, всеки отделен дух в отделно тяло и след смъртта си те се връщат в груповия дух, усвоили по-висока степен на съзнание отколкото когато са били родени. Това помага на груповия дух да еволюира и в отплата, той се грижи за духовете на отделните животни в своята група. Както всеки друг дух, груповият дух не може да умре. Той е опекун и пазител на животинските духове и с тяхното развитие духовното тяло на груповия дух претърпява метаморфоза. Когато отделните животински духове са еволюирали в достатъчна степен, те стават индивидуализирани човешки същества (няма се предвид , че стават хора като нас, животните принадлежат към друга вълна на живот, стават индивидуализирани духове подобно на нас), но остават под ръководството на същия групов дух, подобно на човешките раси под властта на расов дух. Те не стават свои собствени господари докато не се развият отвъд нивото на зависимост от семейството или нацията. Затова Христос е казал, че ‘’докато човек не изостави баща и майка той не може да ме последва’'. 

Какво се случва с животинската душа при смъртта, можем да кажем, че след напускането на това тяло тя скоро се връща при груповия дух, а любовта и грижата които сме и’ дали естествено много и’ помагат в нейната еволюция, защото докато дивите животни живеят и действат изцяло под диктата на груповия дух чрез това което наричаме инстинкт, домашните любимци проявяват способност за мислене, силно изпреварвайки своята нормална еволюция за настоящето време. Те са придобили тази способност от нас на същия принцип както ако приближим един проводник до друг проводник, който е зареден интензивно с електрически ток, незареденият ще се зареди по индукция с електрически ток с по-ниско напрежение. По подобен начин, животното което контактува с хора не притежава от само себе си способността за мислене, но се научава на това в зависимост от интензивността на този контакт. И ние спокойно можем да заключим, че тези животни които живеят в дома на хората ще станат след време учители на своите по-малко напреднали братя. 

### <h3 id="question-170">ВЪПРОС No.170</h3>

Какво вещество отделя човекът или животното с помощта на което те могат да бъдат проследени и открити, като например престъпници биват откривани от кучета следотърсачи? 

Отговор: Когато един ясновидец наблюдава другите хора с етерно зрение за първи път, обикновено той е стъписан от това че вижда дъжд от звезди, пирамиди, двойни пирамиди и всички възможни геометрични фигури излъчвани от техните ръце и лица; той е силно озадачен и се пита какво означава това. По късно той научава, че това са твърдите частици от които е съставено тялото и които се излъчват чрез кожата. Повечето от отделящите се вещества се задържат и остават в дрехите и дават на кучетата следотърсачи необходимата стартова позиция за проследяването. Когато тези частици се разлагат, те излъчват изпарения и миризма подобна на тази която се излъчва от всички разлагащи се тела Тази миризма усещаме от дрехи оставени неизпрани за известно време. Кучетата, които имат по-остро обоняние от хората, правят разлика между миризмите на различните хора и тъй като частиците от човек бягащ от правосъдието са разпръснати по пътя по който се движи, лесно е за следотърсача да ги различи от частиците на други хора или животни в продължение на кратко време след като беглецът е минал от там.

### <h3 id="question-171">ВЪПРОС No.171</h3>

Какъв е произхода на живота? 

Отговор: Ако се зададе този въпрос на учен, той ще започне да обяснява за протоплазма, протил или нещо подобно, но това е форма. Няма значение колко малка, незначителна и проста тази форма може да бъде, все пак е форма и от гледна точка на окултиста въпроса е формулиран неточно, защото духът Е, БИЛ Е и ВИНАГИ ЩЕ БЪДЕ. Както сър Edwin Arnold е казал в своето прекрасно стихотворение ‘’Небесна песен’’: 

```
‘’Духът никога не е бил роден; духът никога не ще престане да бъде;   
Никога не имало времена когато го е нямало; Начало и Край са само сън!   
Нероден и безсмъртен и непроменен духът остава за винаги;   
Смъртта изобщо не може да го докосне, това което се вижда, е как смъртта докосва неговия дом!   

Както когато някой изоставя износените си одежди,   
И взима нови, казвайки ‘’Тези ще нося днес!’’   
Така и духът лесно се отделя от своята дреха от плът,   
И отминава за да насели ново обиталище.’’   
```

Това което изгражда формите е живота и той ги използва за известно време за да осъществи напредък посредством тях. Когато те престанат да бъдат от полза животът се отделя изоставяйки формите зад себе си. 

### <h3 id="question-172">ВЪПРОС No.172</h3>

Какво представлява материята? 

Отговор: Има различни теории за материята. Ако попитаме материалиста той, разбира се, поддържа становището че материята е единствената реалност; че всичко е материя и че нищо друго освен това не може да съществува. Ученият изповядващ Християнската религия е на противното мнение. Той държи на това, че материята е несъществуваща илюзия; че всичко което съществува е дух, и така тези две групи от хора подържат две антитези. Но истината е по средата. 

Когато Бог желае да се прояви, Той еманира вътре в себе Си мисъл-формите на такава вселена каквато Той иска да сътвори и тези архетипни представи са дух когато в началото са еманирани в този централен източни. Но под въздействието на времето и пространството, те бавно кристализират и стават това което ние познаваме като материя. Това е подобен процес на процеса който се наблюдава при растежа на един охлюв. Течният секрет от неговото меко и гъвкаво тяло постепенно се втвърдява в корава черупка която съществува само чрез охлюва. Следователно, както къщата на охлюва представлява кристализирал охлюв, така и материята е кристализирал дух. И както къщата на охлюва стои неподвижна когато не е движена от охлюва, така и материята е неподвижна когато не се привежда в движение от духа. Но с течение на времето къщата на охлюва ще започне да се разлага. Материята от която е била изградена се разпада на много малки частици и става достъпна за построяване на други форми – може да стане отново тяло на охлюв. Така също и кристализиралият дух – материята – се ре- етеризира и става отново дух. Материята еволюира както духа, защото тя става във все по-голяма степен етерна, по-променлива, по-пластична и по-податлива на въздействието на духа, когато последователно много пъти се вгражда в различни форми. 

И така, можем да кажем както Ученият Християнин, че всичко е дух, че това което изглежда материя в действителност е дух в състояние на кристализация, но така също можем да се съгласим с материалиста, че всичко е материя, защото духът който още не кристализирал в материя, евентуално ще го направи. Погрешно е да се смята каквото и да било в Божествената Вселена за нереално; и двете – и материята и духът са реални. Те са положителния и отрицателния полюси на Бог. 

### <h3 id="question-173">ВЪПРОС No.173</h3>

Вие казахте в предишната лекция, че земята е тяло на дух който дарява своя живот обитателите върху повърхността и’. Защо той дава на някои цветя и плодове, на други земетресение и глад? 

Отговор: През интервала между смъртта и новото раждане, дискарнираните духове които са достигнали Второто Небе където се намират архетипите на всичко, изграждат своята бъдеща околна среда в която те жънат това което са посели. Ако те са били усърдни и трудолюбиви в предишните животи, ако те са обработвали земята и са направили така че от всеки стрък да поникнат два, те ще сътворят за себе си още по-плодородна земя с по-богат добив изразходвайки по- малко усилия. Ако те са прекарвали времето си мислейки за Нирвана, небесно място за почивка и безделие, и им е било по-приятно да дискутират по метафизични въпроси отколкото да се занимават с материалните неща, те ще продължават да вършат същото на Второто Небе и като последствие тяхната земя ще бъде безводна и суха когато се върнат обратно за земен живот. Тогава те ще преживеят глад, несъвършенства и земетресения, за да могат да разберат и осъзнаят необходимостта от труд в материалния свят. Така след време те ще си научат урока и ще се стремят да завоюват този свят както ние на Запад сме направили, защото разбира се, задаващият въпроса насочва към хората от Изтока които страдат от наводнения и глад. Те са нашите по-млади братя, които са след нас в еволюцията и трябва да продължават по нашите стъпки. Те трябва да се научат да забравят за известно време духовните светове с цел да постигнат развитие което само материалният свят може да им даде. И така, има сериозна причина за глада който понастоящем е техния жребий и има също така сериозна причина за нашия просперитет. Гладът им, евентуално в бъдеще, ще спомогне да се озоват в условия в по-голяма степен материални, но ние имайки земя даряваща ни с изобилие от всичко добро което съществува на този свят, където способни изобретатели правят живота ни по всякакъв начин по-лек, евентуално в бъдеще ще си кажем, когато сме задоволени с всички материални блага, ‘’Какво му е толкова хубавото във всичко това? По добре да имаме духовните блага.’’ и тогава ние ще започнем духовното си развитие от много по-високо ниво отколкото това на Източния свят. 

### <h3 id="question-174">ВЪПРОС No.174</h3>

Какъв е смисъла на сентенцията ;;Човече, познай себе си? 

Отговор: Това изречение е било открито над входа към гръцки мистичен храм като едно потвърждение на факта, че човек е длъжен изцяло и до край да разбере тайната на своето собствено същество, която е много по-дълбока отколкото изглежда на повърхността. Да направи това базирайки се на принципа на херметическата аксиома ‘’каквото горе, такова и долу’’. Когато той разбере себе си и опознае себе си, той ще бъде в състояние по аналогия да има познания и за Бога. Защото истина е казаното: ‘’Човек беше сътворен по Божие подобие’’. 

Но за да опознае себе си, не само че е необходимо той да проумее каквото - вижда физическото тяло, но също и невидимите тела които са създателите на неговите мисли, чувства и емоции. Това е било учението предлагано в мистерийните храмове. 

Има и друг много по-дълбок смисъл на това изречение. Когато ние се питаме за причините на цялото страдание и нищета на света, ние трябва да обърнем поглед назад към най-ранните епохи от съществуването на земята за да разберем този проблем. През първите две Епохи, Поларианската и Хипербореанската, човек е бил комплектна създаваща единица, способна да изпраща извън себе си силите които създават едно тяло за друго същество. Но през Лемурианската Епоха, когато е станало необходимо да се изградят мозък и ларинкс, половата сила е била разделена и едната половина е била отнета за изпълнението на тази задача. Само другата половина е останала на разположение за размножаване. Тогава човек е престанал да познава себе си, но ‘’Адам позна жена си’’, и в резултат на това тя му родила деца. 

Духът по наследство чувства своята собствена божествена създаваща природа и тайно се бунтува срещу необходимостта да търси сътрудничеството на друг за възпроизводство. Като резултат страданието, болестите и болката са се появили на земята и ще съществуват до тогава, докато съществува настоящият начин на размножаване който изисква двама души съвместно да продължават рода. И в бъдеще пред човека е поставена великолепната цел – обединяването на двата полюса на създаващата сила което отново ще направи човек индивидуален създател, себе-достатъчен творец, както е било завещано чрез мистериозните думи: ‘’Човече, познай себе си’’. 

Апостол Йоан в своето Първо Послание 3та глава 8ми стих, ни посочва пътя за постигане на целта когато казва, че ‘’Който прави грях, от дявола е…Затова се и яви Син Божий, за да разруши делата на дявола…Всякой, който е роден от Бога, грях не прави, защото семето му пребъдва в него…’’. 

Където се удовлетворяват животинските наклонности и сексуалната способност се използва по ненормален начин, възможно е човек да оглупее, но мислите на духовния човек са нравствени, добродетелни и изпълнени с мъдрост. 

Сега, за създаване на тела-носители на Его които пристигат за прераждане, е необходимо сътрудничество между половете, но ще дойде време когато човек ще престане да създава по този начин. Той ще познае себе си. Силен и концентриран, нали семето остава в него, той ще го проявява посредством ларинкса като Творческо Слово, слово което ще формира предмети във Физическия Свят. Тогава вече няма да съществува необходимостта за хората да търсят съдействие един с друг за осигуряването на нови тела-носители. На това е бил учен в тайните школи, които са междинни спирки по пътя на познанието и затова израза ‘’Човече, познай себе си’’ е бил гравиран над светилището на Делфийския Оракул.

Какво представлява Свещения Граал? 

Отговор: Историята за Свещения Граал е един от митовете използвани от великите водачи на човечеството за да ни предадат духовни истини под формата на символи, които по онова време са били неразбираеми за нашия млад интелект. 

Историята за Граала се среща, по различен начин разказана, сред всички ранни раси толкова назад във времето, колкото можем да проследим религиозните учения и много разкази са написани за тази вълшебна мистериозна панацея за всяко зло. 

По времето на средновековието са били разказвани и рецитирани много версии на тази легенда от свещеници, странстващи певци, трубадури и майстори – певци. Най-красива, може би, е семплата версия на Волфганг фон Ешенбах, която е взаимствана от майстора на изкуствата на деветнадесети век Рихард Вагнер в неговата известна музикална драма ‘’Парсифал’’. 

Историята разказва, че през нощта когато нашият Спасител имал последната вечеря със Своите ученици, Той е пил от една чаша или потир и по-късно когато кръвта на живота е изтичала от Неговата ранена гръд, Йосиф от Ариматеа събрал малко кръв от нашия умиращ спасител в този потир. Той също така е взел и копието от мястото където е било забито. Тези реликви той е носил със себе си в продължение на много години и чудесната даряваща живот сила на кръвта на Спасителя го е подкрепяла през всичките негови лишения в тъмницата и през неговите скиталчества. Накрая реликвите са били занесени на небето за известно време и са били под грижите на Ангелите, но една нощ се появил странен вестител изпратен от Бог при светия Титурел със заповед той да построи замък високо във въздуха на върха на планината и там да събере около себе си група от рицари, които трябвало да бъдат целомъдрени и чисти. На тези Рицари на Граала им е било позволено да съхраняват свещените реликви за определено време и така да бъдат вдъхновени със стремеж и сила за да извършат велики духовни дела по света. След време Титурел предал на съхранение Граала на своя син Амфортас и през неговото владичество като Крал на Граала Рицарите на Граала били сполетени от трагично бедствие. 

В една гореща долина под замъка живеел един черен рицар чието име било Клингсор който желаел да стане Рицар на Граала. Той не бил целомъдрен, затова за да отговаря на условията, той се осакатил по такъв начин, че за нега да стане невъзможно да задоволява желанията. Но когато се явил пред светия Титурел последният прозрял в сърцето му и отказал да го приеме. Тогава Клингсор се заклел, че ако той няма да служи на Граала, Граалът ще служи на него. Той изпълнил градината на своя мистичен замък с призрачни фантастични цветя- девойки които пресрещнали Рицарите на Граала по пътя им към и от замъка, съблазнили ги и по този начин ги направили негодни за понататъчно служене като Рицари на Граала. 

Страхувайки се, че всички Рицари на Граала могат да станат затворници на Клингсор, Амфортас решил да се пребори с Черния магьосник. Той взел със себе си святото копие за да извърши това дело. Но Клингсор извикал Кундри, която е създание съставено от две същества. Веднъж тя е верен и предан служител на Граала, друг път е безволев инструмент в ръцете на Клингсор. Когато служи на Граала тя е смирена, покорна и облечена семпло. Под магьосничеството на Клингсор тя става невероятно красива, жена със съблазнителен чар и тогава тя е принудена да го използва както Клингсор и’ заповяда защото той има власт над нея по простата причина, че той не е чувствителен към нейната съблазън и не и’ се поддава поради това, че се е кастрирал. 

Кундри среща Амфортас, който отстъпва пред нейния омагьосващ чар. Докато лежи в нейните обятия, копието изпадва от ръката му и чакащият Клингсор го грабва, нанася удар и причинява на Амфортас рана която не може да зарасне и в продължение на много години Кралят страда и се измъчва, особено когато разбулва Светия Граал в полза на неговите рицари. Тогава раната от копието започва да кърви наново причинявайки му най-мъчителната болка. 

Обобщавайки, това една от няколкото валидни интерпретации на темата Граал: другите символи, Кундри е отрицателното плътно тяло което понякога е под контрола на висшата природа символизирана от Рицарите на Граала, а друг път е управлявано от нисшата природа на желанията символизирана от Клингсор, който съблазнява духа да се откаже от висшите си идеали и предизвиква страдания когато се отстъпи пред съблазънта; в образа на Парсифал, чистия и добродушния, виждаме човек който побеждава и затова успешно изпълнява ролята на пазител на Граала. 

На Разпети Петък сутринта, 1857 година, Рихард Вагнер бил във Вила Везендонк до Цюрих и както си седял наблюдавал наоколо, слънцето греело, цялата природа се усмихвала и от милионите семенца заровени в земята около него били израснали безброй растения и цветя. Една мисъл се появила в главата му: ‘’Каква е връзката между смъртта на Спасителя през това време на годината и това изобилие на изникнал живот?’’ и мислейки за това той се приближил много близо до ключа за разгадаване на тайната на Граала, защото Граалът е бил Мистерийна Школа, една от многото които са съществували през средните векове. Историите за Крал Артур и неговите Рицари на Кръглата Маса не са измислици, те са факт. Имало е такава Мистерия в Уелс по времето на кралица Елизабет. И тези Тайни Школи съществуват и до ден днешен, въпреки че не са така публично известни както са били през по-спиритуалистичните времена на средновековието. Мистерията на Крал Артур е имала повече общо с материалната и временна страна на живота, отколкото мистерията на Граала, която изцяло е извисена и духовна. Там ученикът е бил обучаван, не с думи, но му е било предавано чувството, обучение отвътре, което можем да изразим по следния начин: 

Всички вие наблюдавате различните царства на света. Има човек, животно, растение и минерал. Животът, който е във всяко едно от тези царства, е единствения универсален(всеобщ) живот на Бог, който се проявява чрез тези различни форми. Когато формите се разлагат става необходимо на тяхното място да се доставят други форми, размножителната дейност изпълнява тази функция. В растителното царство, което е под вас, тази дейност е чиста и целомъдрена. Няма страст, свързана с нея по някакъв начин. 

В Божиите царства, които са отвъд вас, тя също се извършва като процес на регенерация която е чиста и свята. Но в царствата които се намират между растението и боговете, състоянието е обратното на целомъдрие. Човек и животно са страстни. Човек, всъщност е обърнато наопаки растение. Растението няма срам и протяга своя създаващ орган, цвета, нагоре към слънцето, едно възхитително цвете, чисто, целомъдрено и безстрастно. Човек е обърнал своя създаващ орган надолу към земята; той го крие със срам защото е изпълнен със страст и похот. След време човек трябва да стане бог, той ще трябва да използва творческата си сила за размножаване за създаване в полза на другите, а не за чувствено задоволяване. И така след време човек трябва да стане подобен на растение на по-високо ниво. Затова съществува този символ: Семенникът на растението който съдържа в себе си семената е Граала, а копието което изважда тези семена извън растението е слънчевия лъч. Вие, също така, трябва да научите да поемате слънчева енергия, която е строителя на всички форми и да я използвате във вашия създаващ орган без страст и сластолюбие, така че това което създавате ще бъде целомъдрено заченато, а не като е сега заченато в грях. 

Соковете на растението текат по неговото зелено стъбло и остават безцветни, чисти и целомъдрени. Вашата кръв е червена и изпълнена със страст, но в регенерацията тази кръв трябва да се изчисти посредством духовната сила която ще дойде при вас от духовното слънце, като силите от физическото слънце движат соковете на растението. И така възродени, вие ще умрете като човек за да възкръснете като Бог.

Какво общо има между строителите на пирамиди в Египет и строителите на пирамиди в Централна Америка? Коя е по-старата цивилизация? 

Отговор: Изследователите антрополози са открили, че Негроидните раси имат дълга тясна глава, тесни очни орбити на черепа и плосък косъм. Монголоидните раси, индианците вкл., имат кръгли глави, кръгли очни орбити на черепа и кръгло сечение на косъма. Главата на белите раси е овална, такива са и очните отверстия на черепа и сечението на косъма, показвайки че на земята има три вида хора, негроидните раси са остатъци от Лемурианската Раса които са живели през Третата епоха от развитието на земята. Хората от монголоидните раси, индианците вкл., са остатъци от хората на Атлантида, а белите раси са сегашните Арианци. Проучвания ще разкрият, че египтяните са принадлежали към нашите сегашни Ариански раси, докато ацтеките притежават отличителните черти на черепа, орбитите и косъма на хората от Атлантида. Поради това тази цивилизация е по-стара от египетската. 

Не е написано много за пирамидите от Централна Америка, но Piazzi Smith и Richard Proctor, и двамата професионални астрономи, са публикували статии за египетските пирамиди и са положили усилия да разкрият какво е било тяхното предназначение и по какъв начин са били използвани. От измерванията на пирамидите, Piazzi Smith извежда хипотеза, че те са били построени от богове-архитекти, идея на която професор Proctor се присмива, въпреки че той открива че измерванията подкрепят теорията на професор Smith, но той отдава това на случайност. Когато измерената основа на пирамидата е равна на няколко стотин инча колкото дни има в годината; когато диагоналите на основата съдържат същия брои инча колкото години има във великата сидерална световна година, просто няма как да се е получило случайно, както смята професор Proctor. Тези случайности са толкова много на брой, обаче, че за един непредубеден разум започват да изглеждат като израз на предварително дефиниран проект. Професор Proctor, бидейки неволен свидетел на хипотезата за разработването на пирамидата с астрологически цели, дава допълнителна стойност на своето твърдение когато се съгласява, че измежду всички съвременни хипотези засягащи предназначението на пирамидите, идеята че те са били построени с астрологически цели е единствената която издържа на тежестта на контриращите доказателства. Затова, въпреки че той я характеризира като наивна идея, тя е единствената защитима теория, съгласно доказателствата. 

Всъщност, пирамидите са били храмове за посвещаване, построени от Йерофантите на (началните) по-малките мистерии и тъй като посвещаването на кандидатите се базира на разположението на небесните тела, звездите, през дванадесетте знаци на зодиака, естествено тези храмове за посвещаване са включвали в себе си всички космически мерки. Само Хеопсовата пирамида от египетските пирамиди е била използвана по този начин. Другите просто са били имитации построени през по-късни времена от фараони. Тези по-малки мистерии са съществували в различни части от света и по различно време. В Индия, в Египет, в Гърция и също в Централна Америка. Затова връзката между строителите на пирамидите построени в една част на света и в друга, е че всички те са били Йерофанти на по-малките мистерии и че техните храмове са били използвани с цел посвещаване.

Каква е съществената разлика между ученията на Философията на Розенкройцерите и ортодоксалната църква? 

Отговор: Има много, но може би главната е, че ортодоксалната религия проповядва че при всяко раждане една току що новосъздадена от ръката на Бог душа навлиза в материално съществуване, че тя живее тук в материално тяло за по-дълъг или по-къс период от време и след това със смъртта отива в невидимото отвъдно, да остане там през цялата вечност в състояние на блаженство или страдание в зависимост от това какво е извършила докато е била тук. 

Учението на Розенкройцерите е, че всяка душа е неразделна част от Бога, която се стреми да събира и натрупва опит чрез съответните преживявания в постепенно подобряващи се и усъвършенстващи се материални тела и, че затова тя навлиза и излиза от материални съществувания много пъти; че всеки път тя натрупва по малко повече опитност отколкото е притежавала преди това и след време от състояние на незнание се насища до състояние на всезнание – от немощ до всемогъщество – посредством тази опитност. 

Нашето чувство за справедливост се бунтува срещу учение което изпраща една душа в дом на благородно семейство с висока култура където тя има предимство на богатството, където у растящото дете се насаждат принципи на морал, а изпраща друга душа в бедняшки квартал, неговият баща е крадец а майка му, може би, е пропаднала жена и където то се учи да лъже, да краде и така нататък. Ако тук, само веднъж, всички ще трябва да бъдат съдени според едни и същи закони, би трябвало всички да имат еднакъв шанс, а знаем че няма дори двама човека при еднакви условия и с еднакъв начин на живот. Известно ние, че докато някой среща много изкушения, друг живее сравнително недокоснат от бурите на живота. Затова, когато една душа е поставена във високо нравствено обкръжение, а друга в неморално, не е правилно едната да бъде изпратена на едно небе на радост и вечно блаженство защото тя не е допринесла с нищо за праведния живот който е водила, също така не справедливо да бъде изпратена другата в ада защото е ограбвала, ако обкръжението и условията в които е била поставена са били такива, че човек не е можел да се промени към добро. 

Затова, учението на Розенкройцерите отстоява тезата, че ние идваме на най- подходящото за нас място съобразно нашите минали преживявания и опитност от предишните животи и че получаваме точно каквото сме заслужили, във всички случаи; че всички преживявания които ни се случват са точно това от което имаме нужда и което ще ни даде подходящия стимул и тласък за следваща стъпка в развитието ни. 

### <h3 id="question-178">ВЪПРОС No.178</h3>

Бихте ли били така любезни да изложите същественото по което Философията на Розенкройцерите се различава от Теософията? 

Отговор: Ние не сме заинтересувани повече от търсене на различия отколкото от намиране на съгласие. Може да се каже, обаче, че Философията на Розенкройцерите е Западно учение дадено на хората от Запада* сега за техния напредък. Ако възприемаме че теософията означава (Божествена Мъдрост) , тогава, разбира се, Философията на Розенкройцерите е само част от тази Божествена Мъдрост, както всички други религиозни системи. Но ако възприемаме теософията като философия разпространявана от Теософското Сдружение, или Сдружения, защото има няколко клона, тогава можем да кажем, че Учението на Розенкройцерите е много по-обширно, богато и завършено. Освен това, проповядвайки своята философия розенкройцерите използват диаметрално противоположен метод спрямо метода на Теософското Сдружение, който съдържа следните цели: 

() - Запада или Западния Свят* - страните в които Християнството е официална и основна религия.  

Първо, Формирането на ядро-център на Универсалното Братство;   

Второ, Изучаването на компаративна религия; и   

Трето, Изследването на необяснимите всемирни закони и латентните сили(способности) у човек.   

Братята на Кръста на Розата твърдят, че болшинството от напредналите хора симпатизират на идеята за Универсално Братство и не ни е необходимо да бъдем теософи за да приемем тази идея със сърцето си. Безброй много други Общества притежават алтруистични идеи в съзвучие с идеята за братството. Много учени се занимават с изследване на компаративната религия и го правят изключително добре. Хе е нужно да бъдеш теософ за да се занимаваш с тази тема, но е задължително да бъдеш окултист за да се занимаваш с третата цел на Теософското Сдружение, а именно с изследване на необяснимите природни закони и силите които са латентни в човек. 

Затова, Розенкройцерите препоръчват цялата мисъл да бъде концентрирана във живеенето по такъв начин и практикуването на такива упражнения, които ще развият латентните сили във всеки ученик, така че той да може да вижда и опознава невидимите светове откъдето произлизат причините които виждаме проявени тук. Когато тази цел е постигната, но не преди това, той ще бъде в състояние да изследва необяснимите природни закони. Тогава той ще бъде в много по-добра позиция отколкото учените или който и да било друг който изучава компаративна религия, защото той вижда централния източник от който произхождат всички религии, всяка адаптирана за хората на които е дадена. Той също вижда как те се вграждат във великата схема на еволюцията и когато е придобил способността да достигне до съзнанието присъщо на вътрешните светове, единството на живота е толкова очевидно, че той няма нужда да се занимава с точка първа от целите на Теософското Сдружение, универсалността (общността) на Единия Живот която прави братството факт във всемира, отвъд необходимостта от доказателство. 

За да постигнем тази последна стъпка трябва да имаме истинна представа за материята. Ние може да поучаваме печката, че нейно задължение е да ни топли, но докато не се подчиним на законите на нейната същност и не поставим гориво в нея няма да има никаква полза от поучаването ни. Принципът е същия, докато не достигнем нивото на екзалтация където нашите сърца са изпълнени с божествена любов, ние може да поучаваме прилагаме тактики относно Универсалното Братство, но нищо няма да се получи. Ако напълним печката с гориво тя ще ни топли и ако изпълним нашите сърца с любов те ще излъчват тази любов без изявления за цели, както споменатата първа точка. 

Затова главната разлика между Теософското Сдружение и Розенкройцерското братство е: напълно противоположния метод. Защото, докато Теософското Сдружение се стреми да формира централно ядро на Универсалното Братство посредством изучаването на компаративна религия и само изучаването на скритата страна на човешката природа – много хора дори подценяват и не одобряват развитието на скритите сили – Розенкройцерското учение насърчава ученика преди всичко да живее живота (нравствен духовен начин на живот), да концентрира всички сили на своето същество и така да върви напред, че да стане способен за притежаването на спиритуалните сили, което е абсолютно съществено за проучванията които той възнамерява да извърши. 

### <h3 id="question-179">ВЪПРОС No.179</h3>

Дали Бялата Ложа на Теософското Сдружение е същото нещо като Храма на Розенкройцерите? 

Отговор: Не, Теософското сдружение просто е една екзотерична организация за разпространяване на определена философия, предимно произлизаща от Източните Религии, докато Братството на Розенкройцерите се стреми да провъзгласява Учението на Западната Мистерийна (тайна) Школа. Орденът на Розенкройцерите, който е таен и до него няма достъп никой, освен чрез директно посвещаване. 

Колкото до сходството на Ордена на Розенкройцерите и подобни Мистерийни Ордени с Бялата Ложа, можем да кажем, че на различни места на земята има множество такива школи на по-малките мистерии, всяка от тях се състои от дванадесет братя, а също така и от един тринадесети член. Последният е връзката между различните школи и всички тези оглавяващи или тринадесети членове образуват това което е известно като Бялата Ложа, а именно, върховния конклав от Старшите измежду нашите Братя, които сега са изцяло отговорни за човешката еволюция и планират стъпките които трябва да следваме за да напреднем. 

### <h3 id="question-180">ВЪПРОС No.180</h3>

Какво разбирате под термина Майстор-Учител и дали движението на Братството на Розенкройцерите се е зародило благодарение на тях? 

Отговор: В далечния Изток ученикът, който се стреми към духовно извисения начин на живот, търси един ‘’Майстор-учител’’ и се обвързва напълно с този Учител. Той трябва сляпо да следва инструкциите на този учител без никакво колебание или проява на любопитство относно причините за напътствията които получава. Той трябва лично да служи на учителя изпълнявайки всичко което се изисква от него и независимо от цената или неудобството което му се причинява и така след време той фактически става роб на един често много строг и взискателен учител. 

Този метод изглежда много варварски, но той безусловно е единствения начин да се преодолее ориенталската леност и понеже те са назадничави Его, те са привикнали към сервилност и раболепие, така че това не е изпитание за техните чувства. Но тук, в Западния Свят такъв подход би бил деградиращ защото ние сме напреднали до такова ниво на индивидуализация, че можем да постигнем напредък само чрез действие отвътре и ако ние даваме някакви обещания и обети ние не се задължаваме към никой друг, а даваме обещания и обети пред самите нас; защото ако не можем да спазим нашите клетви пред себе си със сигурност няма да можем да изпълним обещания дадени на другите. 

И още, ние може да не изпълним обещание дадено другиму и да го измамим че сме спазили каквото сме обещали, но не можем да измамим себе си. Ако не спазим обещание направено пред самите нас ще разберем това веднага, затова ученикът от Западния Свят получава инструкции да прави обещанията за себе си, защото това е по-резултатно от всеки обет даден пред някой друг. Учителят в Западния Свят е най-близкия приятел и съветник на ученика защото той следва примера на Христос, който е казал на своите ученици: ‘’Тази е моята заповед: да любите един другиго, както Аз ви възлюбих.’’ ‘’Вие сте Ми приятели, ако вършите всичко онова, що ви Аз заповядвам.’’ ‘’Не ви наричам вече слуги, защото слугата не знае, що върши господаря му; а ви нарекох приятели, защото ви казах всичко, що съм чул от Отца Си.’’ Йоан, глава 15 : 12, 14, 15. 

Братството на Розенкройцерите не е основано от такива учители и не се поддържа чрез тяхното въздействие; то е предало определено учение на автора при условие, че той ще го разпространи по възможно най-добрия начин на който е способен, и ще даде гласност на неговото учение за да помогне на другите които са подготвени за тези инструкции. Изучаващи това учение са се обединили за да използват предимствата на съвместното обучение, но не съществува силна обвързваща организация, нито съществува намерение да се основе такава, целта е да се даде възможност на хората да получат това учение навсякъде където се намират. Ние предпочитаме те да останат в своите църкви. 

### <h3 id="question-181">ВЪПРОС No.181</h3>

Ако някой който вярва в учението предоставяно от Розенкройцерите искрено поддържа че то е истинно, не е ли той застрашен от опасността да стане догматичен и нетолерантен към мнението на другите? И какво трябва да бъде отношението му към тези, които отказват да приемат това учение? 

Отговор: От изключителна важно значение е да осъзнаем факта, че поне в сегашното ни ограничено съществуване ние на можем да достигнем до истината, до краен предел. Затова, това което ни се струва ‘’истина, и цялата истина’’ най- вероятно все пак е само част от истината. В процеса на развитието ни като придобиваме способността да разбираме все повече и повече, нашата концепция за живота, света и Бог се променя. Затова винаги трябва да държим ума си отворен за да можем да възприемаме новите истини, и въпреки че никога не трябва да бъдем равнодушни а винаги искрени в това което вярваме че е истина, ние никога не трябва да забравяме факта че има по-велики истини които още не сме научили. Тогава ние ще бъдем с открит разум и няма да станем ограничени и фанатици. 

Някои хора стават толкова ентусиазирани и силно завладени от идеята, че са открили нещо което им изглежда истина, че те веднага предприемат истински кръстоносен поход за да убедят другите и те да приемат тази истина. Това е голяма грешка. Ако отидем в някоя църква и започнем да задаваме въпроси които всяват съмнение в ума на хората там и им създава трудности относно тяхната вяра, ние лесно ще предизвикаме състояние на смущение и объркване. Ако това което искаме да им предадем им допада и ги привлича, така че да се чувстват добре с новата по-висша вяра, всичко е наред. Но ако се случи така, че това което искаме да им дадем е отвъд техните възможности, неприемливо е, може да се получи обратен ефект и да ги подтикнем да се обърнат към материализъм, атеизъм или някое друго твърде скептично отношение към света. Ние ще сме виновни, в този случай. Ние трябва да си създадем и винаги да спазваме правилото да бъдем много дискретни за това в какво вярваме или не вярваме, въпреки че никога не трябва да пропускаме да кажем малко там където се открива възможност и ако това малко което сме казали предизвиква въпрос, трябва без страх да отговорим на него. По този начин може постепенно да увлечем питащия. Той няма да се остави да бъде увлечен ако не търси и ако разберем че желае информацията, ние трябва да му дадем всичко което иска и да го дадем безкористно. Но пак повтарям, че поемаме много сериозна отговорност ако натрапваме нашето мнение на хора които не го желаят или не са готови.

Защо се получава така, че малко от тези които изучават висшата философия се интересуват от подобряването на условията в индустриалното общество, като премахването на робството на наемния труд, което е толкова унизително и брутално както робството на негрите? 

Отговор: Всички окултисти разбират крещящата нужда на деня, никой друг не копнее така горещо за деня на свободата като тях, денят когато братската любов ще бъде факт, когато народите ще претопят своите мечове в плугове и копията си в сърпове, както е предрекъл Исая, но те подхождат по различен начин към създаването на такива условия. Социалистическият профсъюз и другите подобни организации се стремят към по- добри условия, но окултистът поддържа позицията, че техните методи са безрезултатни и не допринасят за трайна реализация на намеренията им, защото няма съмнение, че човекът е този който създава условията, а не са условията които създават човека. Ако, поради това, ние се стремим да направим човечеството по-добро и да повдигнем критериите за добро и зло, ако се стремим да извисим идеалите му, тогава когато човекът стане по-добър, като естествено следствие и условията ще станат по-добри. 

При сегашното състояние, когато профсъюзът чрез стачка или чрез заплашване на работодателя със стачка, е успял да осигури по-добри условия на труд, работодателят веднага започва да подготвя начини за ликвидиране на постигнатото. Той се обединява с други работодатели за взаимна подкрепа и тези организации винаги са във война с профсъюзите. По-добрите условия, които са постигнати някъде непрекъснато се променят с течение на времето. Ако, обаче, работодателят както и наемният работник са станали добри християни и са се научили да правят за другите това което биха желали другите да правят за тях, няма да има нужда от профсъюзи защото работодателите ще се грижат за благополучието на своите работници и предварително ще изпълняват техните искания. Такова състояние в обществото, окултистът вярва, може да се осъществи като се мисли за него, защото всички обекти и всички социални условия първо са били мисли в ума на хората. Затова той искрено се моли за това, умът на хората да бъде отворен за истината за универсалното(всеобщото) братство, затова те да могат да приемат в сърцата си Божията любов и да се обединят в стремежа си да правят добро вместо поотделно да планират как да потискат другите и да им налагат волята си.

Може ли някой да изучава окултизъм, да води възвишен духовен начин на живот и да бъде милионер? 

Отговор: Христос е казал на богатия млад мъж: ‘’Отиди, отърви се от всичко което имаш’’, но младият младежът, силно привързан към хубавите неща на своя живот, се отдръпнал натъжен. Христос е споменал за трудността за богатите да бъдат допуснати на небето. Той не е казал, че е невъзможно, но е знаел че богатите притежават примката на изкушението. Независимо от това, човек може да бъде милионер и пак да се стреми да живее духовния възвишен живот. Богатите са оковани във вериги, но би било абсолютно погрешно да се направи заключение, че те не подлежат на окултно развитие и напредък. Всичко зависи от това, как се отнася човек към богатството си. Ако той го използва по начин който води до увеличаването му и с цел да потиска събратята си, той няма да има никакъв душевен растеж, но там където човек се смята за управител на своите притежания и където той се стреми да изгражда фабрики създавайки условия за труд, жилища и т.н., където самият той се труди усърдно за да осъществи своите филантропични идеи, и където неговите събратя са получили добри условия на труд и живот и шанс за себеусъвършенстване, богатството е една изключителна сила за добро. Когато човек работи себеотвержено по този начин за благополучието на другите, той няма да има голяма възможност да мисли за своето собствено развитие и неговият душевен растеж ще бъде по-скоро несъзнателен. Независимо от това, той ще напредне извънредно много и възможностите му да извършва по-добри и по-достойни за уважение дела ще се увеличават с напредване на годините през неговия живот, а също така и през бъдещите животи. Такъв е истинският смисъл на притчата за дарбите. Тези които са използвали своите способности са били направени господари на много градове за да им предоставят подходящи условия за работа в схемата на еволюцията. От друга страна, ако един човек притежава производствено предприятие и толкова силно се изпълни с желание за окултно развитие, че егоистично продаде фабриката и изхвърли работниците си на улицата за да си осигури възможност за развитие на собствените си способности и да живее възвишения начин на живот, такъв човек бяга от своите задължения и без съмнение ще получи неодобрението на учителя, защото е погребал своята дарба и в един нов живот той ще се озове лишен от възможностите които е пренебрегнал и отхвърлил.

Вярвате ли в смъртното наказание? Не ли то по-добро и по-милостиво от доживотен затвор? 

Отговор: За варварите може да важи, че по-силният винаги тероризира по- слабия. Ние сме горди, че в нашата цивилизация сме достигнали по-високо ниво и че ние прилагаме алтруизъм във всички аспекти на нашата политика. Все пак, въпреки че не си служим с насилие и безразборни убийства когато ни хрумне, освен по време на война, ние извършваме убийства по рафиниран начин чрез това което наричаме правосъдие. В днешно време ние окачествяваме такова деяние като варварско, но смъртното наказание все още е петно върху нашата цивилизация. Освен това, ние сме много по-изтънчени в нашата жестокост отколкото по-старите цивилизации, защото те са обесвали или обезглавявали така наречените престъпници по бързата процедура, докато ние ги държим затворени в продължение на години, подлагайки ги на мъчението на дълги съдебни процедури, насрочваме деня на екзекуцията след дълъг период от време давайки им възможност през това време да страдат очаквайки и предвкусвайки смъртта през цялото това време. 

Ние претендираме, че всичко това не е отмъщение, а пледираме че то е нужно като гаранция и защита за обществото и като възпиращо средство срещу извършването на престъпления, но смъртното наказание способства за повече убийства. Когато един човек има престъпни наклонности за човеко убийство, той трябва да бъде възпиран по подходящ начин за да не може да нарани друг човек. Да го убием, обаче, не означава да го възпрем; смъртта го освобождава в Света на Желанията и понеже Светът на Желанията е наш свят и ние сме в него, той е напълно свободен да се движи сред хората и да насажда в тях мисли за омраза и мъст срещу обществото. Затова убийството се умножава. Освен това, манията за убийство се насажда и от пресата. Привличащи погледа заглавия които изреждат ужасни подробности от престъплението възбуждат и подстрекават други да действат по подобен начин. Ако пресата запазва мълчание за убийствата и самоубийствата, бихме имали по-малко престъпления в страната и е много приятно да се отбележи, че поне някои вестници, например изданията на Християнската Наука, са се отказали да печатат всичко което не е добро. 

Колкото да тази част от въпроса, която гласи: ‘’Не е ли смъртта по-добра от доживотния затвор?’’ ние може да кажем следното:’’Може би при съвременните условия на затворнически режим, тя е’’. Но тази част от нашите институции също се нуждае от реформа и трябва да направим много и да променим много в начина по който третираме тези които наричаме престъпници. Те са наши братя, също толкова колкото така наречените уважавани членове на обществото които още не са извършили непростимо престъпление защото още не са разкрити. Вярно е, че сме направили затворническия живот по някакъв начин по-добър и по-малко варварски отколкото е бил. Вярно е също, че сега имаме изпитателен срок и помилване, но още сме далече от това да третираме по подходящ начин тези по- слаби братя. Ако бихме могли напълно да проумеем, че те са наши братя и да се отнасяме към тях както бихме се отнасяли към един душевно нестабилен брат който е син на нашата собствена майка, би било добре, защото кой от нас ако неговият роден брат извърши нещо лошо би го изпратил в затвора с презрение и би го нарекъл ‘’пандисчия’’ след като си е излежал присъдата. Или би се отрекъл от него за до края на живота си заради слабостите му. Ако един човек е болен от тиф ние не му се сърдим а го изпращаме в болница за месец; изпращаме го там докато се излекува, грижим се добре за него и се стремим да му помогнем да възстанови здравето си и се радваме заедно с него когато оздравее. Един престъпник е слаб и умствено(душевно) болен. Той не би трябвало да бъде изпращан в затвор за определен период, а би трябвало да бъде изпратен в психиатрична клиника където може да му се помогне по подходящ начин да преодолее своята слабост. Не и преди да започнем да третираме нашите слаби братя с такава любеща грижа, бихме могли да кажем че сме се издигнали над варварската максима изискваща око за око. Как можем да си позволяваме да се молим ’’ прости греховете ни, както ние прощаваме на нашите длъжници’’, докато се отнасяме към тези клети братя, както го правим сега? 

### <h3 id="question-185">ВЪПРОС No.185</h3>

Какво е мнението на Розенкройцерите за избирателното право на жените? 

Отговор: Духът не е нито от мъжки нито от женски пол, а се проявява редуващо се като мъж и жена, така че ако се погледне по-обхватно и от по-далечна гледна точка на казуса избирателно право на жените, ще се стигне до извода че е изгодно за сегашните мъже да дадат на жените това което наистина е тяхно право – пълно равенство във всяко отношение. Двойният социален стандарт който съществува сега, при който един мъж може да извърши социално прегрешение без да бъде санкциониран, трябва да се премахне. Трудът на жената трябва да се заплаща така както и труда на мъжа и във всеки случай трябва да се следват идеите изложени във възхитителната новела на Edward Bellamy: ‘’Поглед назад’’. 

Разумната смисленост на такова социално равенство ще се потвърди ако погледнем на живота като на един от многото земни животи и че се раждаме редуващо се като мъж и жена; но има и други причини защо на жената трябва да се даде правото на глас У мъжа, плътното тяло е положително(активно) и мъжките положителни сили, затова, отчасти са фокусирани върху Химическата Област на физическия свят*. Той се интересува най-вече от това което може да претегли, да измери, да анализира и работи в ежедневието си; неговото развитие е основно в областта на материалните неща, оформяйки света и всичко намиращо се на него за да осъществи своите замисли, но няма почти никакъв интерес към духовната страна на нещата. 

() - Химическата Област на физическия свят* – видимият свят на нашата земя съставен от твърди тела, течности и газове.   

Жената, от друга страна, има положително витално тяло и в резултат на това е в интуитивен контакт с духовните вибрации на вселената. Тя е в по-голяма степен идеалист и е по-надарена с въображение, имайки голям интерес във всичко което действа по посока на нравственото повдигане на рода и тъй като само чрез морален и духовен растеж човечеството може да напредне понастоящем, тя наистина е първостепенния фактор в еволюцията. Би било от изключителна полза за човешкия род, ако на нея и се дадат равни права с мъжа във всяко отношение. Защото само тогава можем да се надяваме да станем свидетели на реформи които реално ще обединят човечеството. Ще разберем това, ако по аналогия се огледаме в нашия дом, където жената наистина е стълба около който и съпругът и децата се събират. В зависимост от способностите си тя прави от дома това което е, тя е стабилизиращото влияние и миротвореца. Бащата може да си отиде със смъртта или по друг начин, децата може да напуснат, но докато майката остава, домът е на мястото си; но когато майката е отнета от смъртта, домът изведнъж се разрушава. 

Някои ще противоречат:’’Да, но ако я отдалечим от дома посредством политика и обществени задължения, домът ще се разруши по същия начин’’. Затова не трябва да има безпокойство. По време на преходния период когато жената трябва да се бори за своите права и може би кратко време след това докато са се пренастроили, в някои случаи би се стигнало до пренебрегване на дома, но там където това вече е било изпробвано нито един дом не е пострадал и резултатите са били много добри, защото на жената винаги може да се разчита че ще защитава всеки процес който води до повдигане на нравствеността и морала. Докато законите са само заместители за времето преди човечеството да се издигне до по-високо ниво когато всеки един човек ще бъде закон сам за себе си правейки добро без принуда, наистина е необходимо да се направят такива реформи от законодателната власт.

Ако окултистите са се отказали да ядат месо защото се изисква проява на жестокост при приготвянето на храната и те не желаят да взимат участие при отнемането на живот, директно или като съучастници, не е ли това също отнемане на живот, когато ядем яйца или плодове, зеленчуци и т.н. ? 

Отговор: Това, за което се споменава във втората част на въпроса, е много различно от отнемането на живот чрез убиване на едно животно. Факт е, че защото необходимостта налага да се убие едно животно за да му се вземе месото, ние нанасяме вреда, докато когато отнемаме плода на едно дърво ние всъщност му помагаме, което наистина ще стане ясно когато разберем процеса на създаването и растежа. 

Процесът е един и същ при животните и при човешките същества и всъщност за всички царства. Когато едно животно е на път да се роди, груповият дух подпомогнат от природните духове и ангелите оформят първоначално виталното тяло на идващото животно, което след това се поставя в утробата на майката и семенните атоми се поставят в тестисите на мъжкото животно; след това се осъществява оплождането и животното се ражда. Без наличието на семенен атом и матрица на виталното тяло не може да се формира плътно тяло на животното. Подобни условия и предпоставки управляват оплождането на едно яйце или на растително семе. Те са като човешката яйцеклетка – представляват една възможност. Ако едно яйце се постави в инкубатор или под кокошка, груповият дух изпраща нужния живот, приемайки възможността за въплътяване. Ако едно семенце е заровено в почвата, то също се оплодява когато са били осигурени подходящи условия за неговото развитие, но не преди това. Когато едно яйце се счупи, свари или по някакъв друг начин се попречи на първоначалното му предназначение, или когато се съхранява може би в продължение на години, няма живот и следователно не е грешно да използваме тези продукти за храна. Дори на растенията се помага когато узрелите плодове се откъсват, защото тогава те престават да поемат сокове от дървото без необходимост.

Това ужасно създание, което G.Lyndon е видял в ‘’Занони’’ на Bulwer Lytton същото ли е като Mr. Hyde в историята на Robert L. Stewenson? 

Отговор: Не, има сходство в някои аспекти, но в друго отношение има много голяма разлика. Ужасното създание видяно от G. Lyndon е известно в окултизма като ‘’Обитателя на границата’’. Когато ученикът встъпва в Света на Желанията в пълно съзнание, изоставил зад себе си спящото физическо тяло, той трябва да премине покрай едно такова същество както е описано от G. Lyndon. То е въплъщението на всички негови зли дела от миналото които още не са изкупени и очакват изчистване в бъдещи животи. Той трябва да разбере и да приеме, че това същество е част от самия него. Той трябва да си обещае, че ще ликвидира възможно най-скоро всички дългове представени чрез тази ужасяваща форма. 

Това същество дори не се явява пред обикновения човек през времето между смъртта и новото раждане, въпреки това винаги съществува. То е демон и се компенсира от друга форма която представлява всичкото добро което човек е сторил в миналото и която може да се нарече неговия ангел хранител, но тези форми близнаци, ако може да се нарекат така, са невидими за обикновения човек през всички времена, въпреки че са мощни влияния в неговия живот. 

Понякога се случва, обаче, че един човек преминава в отвъдното при смърт с природа на желанията толкова изключително силна, че след като той е изкупил дълговете които е имал в Чистилището и е встъпил на Второто Небе, тази черупка се запазва и остава да съществува докато човек се прероди. Тогава тя се привлича към него от сили на магнетизъм и се оказва че той притежава двойно тяло на желанията. Тогава тялото на желанията от стария живот може понякога да се усеща и да го кара да живее двойствен живот, както е описал Robert Louis Stivenson, предизвиквайки го да извършва нещо против волята му, защото страданията породени при изкупването на греховете, действат като съвест и го кара да отхвърля и да се възмущава от злото. За щастие, обаче, през наше време такива случаи се срещат изключително рядко. 

### <h3 id="question-188">ВЪПРОС No.188</h3>

Ако ампутираме ръката на един човек, отсечем клон от едно дърво и откъртим част от една скала, ще се отстрани ли съответната невидима част на тези обекти? 

Отговор: В случая на ръката, която е ампутирана, етерното и съответствие ще съществува с виталното тяло, но има една определена магнитна връзка между него и физическата ръка, която е погребана. Има описан случай за един човек на който е била ампутирана ръката и който много се оплаквал от болки, сякаш нещо му пронизвало плътта на ръката. Тази болка продължила няколко седмици, след което най накрая ръката била ексхумирана и се установило, че един пирон бил закован през месото точно на мястото където човекът усещал болката. Когато пиронът бил отстранен, болката престанала. Хора, на които са били ампутирани крайници, понякога се оплакват от болки в продължение на няколко години след операцията. След това болката престава защото етерната ръка се е разложила едновременно с крайника в гроба. 

Виталното тяло на растението е съставено само от двата най-плътни етера – химическия етер и етера на живота – които дават възможност на растението да расте и да се размножава, но на него му липсват двата по-висши етера – светлинния етер и отразяващия етер – така че то няма сетивност или памет за това какво се случва в неговото обкръжение. Затова, отстраняване на част от него няма да се почувства от растението, и в случая на скалата която е взривена, само химическият етер е наличен, така че кристалите въобще няма да усетят нищо. Обаче, ще бъде погрешно да се направи заключение, че въобще няма никакво чувство в тези случаи, защото въпреки че растенията и минералите нямат индивидуални усещания, те са обвити и проникнати от етерите и Светът на Желанията на планетата, и Планетният Дух чувства всичко, по същия начин както нашият пръст не притежаващ индивидуално тяло на желанията не усеща, но ние, вътреживеещите духове обитаващи тялото, чувстваме всяко нараняване на пръста.

Знаете ли за това място, една къща или убежище където някой може да отиде да живее този красив, прост и простодушен живот, който вие препоръчвате? 

Отговор: Не, ние не знаем нищо за такъв дом и дори да се открие дом с такова предназначение ние бихме съжалявали много живеещите там. Ако ние сме силно раздразнителни и отидем в планината да живеем като отшелници където няма хора да ни ядосват, няма да постигнем много от това, че не сме се разсърдили на никого. Ако ни е трудно да преодолеем лошите си качества и пороците си в града и избягаме далече от хората където такива предизвикателства няма да съществуват, малко ще сме постигнали от гледна точка на способността да не се поддаваме на провокации и раздразнения. Нашето място е в градовете и селата, всред съгражданите си и там сме били поставени с цел да се пригодим и да свикнем с тях и да се научим да си сдържаме нервите независимо от всяко раздразнение – да се научим да се справяме с предизвикателствата където те съществуват. Някой може да е на планината, но неговото сърце да е в града или той може да се затворил в манастир и все пак да му липсват светските занимания. Най-добре е да останем на мястото си и там да развиваме духовните качества които ще ни направят по-добри хора. Има работа за вършене на света и ако бягаме от света, как ще я свършим? Ние имаме отговорности към нашите събратя. Ако не изпълняваме тези отговорности значи бягаме от нашите задължения и съдбата ще ни върне обратно в такава обстановка и на такова място от където няма да можем да избягаме. Затова, по-добре е да полагаме усилия да научим всички уроци които са ни зададени, отколкото да бягаме от тях.
